that would have been nice if it had been updated overall still is a good product price was good,3,1
it said it was new when it was NOT it had been used already but next time i know i will make sure to read the details,3,2
iPhone is too big for pouch.,3,1
"Got it for my 2008 ml350.  Works great for streaming music from iphone to my car system but  does not connect the phone function.  When I get a call, the music mutes automatically but I can't connect to my phone using the car's controls - like on the steering wheel.  I have to pick up my phone and use it directly, so the Viseeo only does half the job I was looking for. However, I think that's a limitation with  my car's system, not  with the Viseeo.  I wish the Viseeo's literature was more clear and complete on that issue.  Videos on youtube are misleading on this because some car systems seem to allow the phone functions along with  playing music while other cars allow only the music.",3,1
I purchased this for my mom for Christmas 2012.  It is now May and the flip cover is hanging by threads.  The style of it is really amazing and it is great for readers who don't want to hold their Nook as they read or watch shows.  However the fact that even though she only opens and closes it about 5-9 times a weeks shows that the way it holds up over a period of time leaves something to be desired.,3,2
What i didn't like is that the panel its self doesn't have very good adhesive so it doesn't stick to the plastic very well and it came with bad wires,3,1
"This is a very handy unit. Uaing a 3.5mm to standard audio plug adapter, I was able to connect my Bluetooth headphones to my stereo receiver. However, I had to play around with the receiver volumen and the headphone volumen until I got a decent sound level without distortion.",3,1
"Works well with the older Ipod and Ipod classic Video. However, even though the radio portion works well with the Ipod touch 3g - the remote portion is useless. Bottom line - if you have the older Ipods ok - If trying it with the ipod touch - unless you just want an FM Radio - stay away.",3,2
"the sides protectors just too easy to brake appart, the sound is ok for regular street users low rms speakers not much, does not blow womem dress way.",3,2
"Only problem I have with this is the fact that the little trim plate around the radio is loose. It doesn't snap into the clips inside the mounting as it should, and thus, it keeps falling out. This is only a problem because the face of my stereo slides itself outward in order to be removed every time the car is turned off. After three or four times of this, the trim pops off in the midst of driving down the road, or while the stereo face is attempting to slide outward.",3,2
"When I got it and looked at it, it seemed to be in alright condition. Sometimes, though when I'm listening to it and it's on hold and placed in my pocket, it likes to pause the song. Imagine how frustrating that can get when it pauses every 2 seconds until you decide to just hold the damn thing.",3,2
"As a standalone sleeve, the product does a good job. However, the belt clip is large and bulky, causing the sleeve and iPhone to stick out dramatically from your hip. Mine would constantly catch on the seat when getting in and out of the car. The clip was also very tight and difficult to open and close over a belt. After only two weeks of use, the belt clip ripped from the back of the sleeve after a snag. The sleeve and phone went flying across the asphalt and the top of the phone (where there is no protection) was badly dinged.  Marware offered to replace the case, but I've kept the sleeve, using it as a pocket protector.",3,2
"Haven't used mine much yet, but some first impressions --<br /><br />Synched up with my Nook HD+ without any real difficulty.  You need to push the \\""bluetooth synch\\"" button firmly, but otherwise it just worked as expected.  I'm running a custom Android/Cyanogen distro from the SD card, rather than the stock B+N Android image.<br /><br />The keyboard itself is a little small/cramped for my hands.  The keys themselves feel a little flimsy, but they work well enough.<br /><br />The case seems nice, reasonably sturdy.<br /><br />On the whole, it works fine.  The keyboard is probably only comfortable/suitable for light use (email, taking notes in class, etc), but for significant typing you'd likely want something else.",3,1
"This is a clone of a $500 device. Don't expect it to do what the dealership can do with theirs. But it got done what I needed to get done. You should know that there is some software piracy involved in the use of this, as you'll have to use a &#34;crack&#34; to use the Techstream software.",3,1
Flaky performance. Terrible remote. Good sound. Wait until ...XT2,3,2
the mounting bracket is very good but the stud snapped in half after a day i had to go to radio shack and buy a new one but very good mount.,3,1
"The sound has not met my expectations and left me surprised. There are other JBL models, with better sound quality.",3,1
This case was okay protected it but not worth it,3,1
I received it on time however could not set it up.   The instructions were not very good ..I am glad I had a friend to could put the numbers in for me and once that was done it works very good for what I wanted it for.  Make sure you know how to set them up if you order this product.,3,1
"It says it fits them all, but it doesn't fit the 2012 version very well.  The hole for the front-facing camera is too small and not quite in the right place.",3,2
"These terminal connectors are ok not great. but the reason for the 3 stars is because two of the terminals were pre used, cleaned and then sent to me, within a couple of days those two were already beginning to corrode, I only used them because I didnt have any others to complete the system.",3,2
Good little clock for the price.  The only problem I have<br /> is the night light is too dim to read the time in a dark room.<br /><br />Minnie Mama,3,1
"The case itself is very durable. It has a couple drawbacks. I cant plug the Zen adapter all the way in unless I maneuver the case a bit to fit it in. If I dont it comes unplugged occasionally when going over bumps or corners( I used my zen for my car stereo) The other complaint is that being a flexible case, the screen that is inside of it comes out very easily, it only stays in with two hinges on the bottom, which constantly move around and maknig the screen useless;",3,1
"Do not buy this sub for sound quality! The suggested parameters for a vented enclosure recommended by hifonics is a stretch, to put it lightly.  My computer kept telling me that it would sound like crap and guess what...it did.  However, with enough power to create a lightning storm over a small town this sub will get loud.  Since this sub was almost free at $60 I still have to give it 3 stars just because it played and didnt explode at 1700 watts from a professional Crown amplifier (1700 watts from Crown = 1,000,000,000 watts from cheaper car amps who inflate numbers.",3,2
I installed this on my wifes 09 accord and I have to say..... Was not too happy with this thing. I fought with this thing for hours so that the pin in the back did not break. Watch out for your air conditioning buttons cuz they will get stuck if you do it wrong. Also on the drivers side there is a lil gap so that sucks. O and with out cutting the brackets for the 2 din part you will never get it in. As far as the finish look its not going to be flush even if you cut parts away from the front...  I just hope that my wife is not too mad when she sees it for the first time tomorrow lol,3,2
"i dont own this, was shopping for one,  but finding a good review on a sat radio is tough, even tougher finding a good review om xm. not sure if i want to get involved with any of this listening to the radio is supposed to be fun. this doesnt sound like a good time.    going to look at hd radio next probally find the same B.S.",3,1
"The case is cute, but it's a pretty cheap plastic design. It's difficult to close, you have to line it up just right. I don't expect it to last, but the price was good.",3,1
My boy had one so I tried it out but apart from that its a good  LCD good for music,3,1
"It doesn’t really matter which “brand” name you see this little dashboard cam listed under here on Amazon.com, they are all the same. You get a front camera with a small LCD screen to view the action and see the menu options, a rear view camera, USB cord, Power cord, suction cup and adhesive attachments and a remote control.<br /><br />The cables are plenty long enough to set this up and hide the cables in a standard car (not sure about an SUV).<br /><br />The cameras are cheap plastic units that feel like they could be easily broken. They do rotate so that you can try to get the best angle/view.<br /><br />The instructions are pretty much useless as is the remote control. I found the remote only works to turn the unit off/on, which you do not need since the unit starts with your car and shuts off after the car power turns off.<br /><br />There is NO infrared (IR) ability, even though it is advertised as such.<br /><br />There is supposedly an internal battery, if there is it lasts less then 5 minutes.<br /><br />The unit will not overwrite the files as the instructions say. You actually have to swap out, reformat or empty your SD card when it is full. Otherwise the unit will get in a loop of turning on and immediately turning off (which makes it hard to format the card in the unit at that point.<br /><br />My rear camera kept falling off the window. Adhesive stuck to the window but the camera came away from the adhesive. Had to glue the camera to the adhesive that was still on the window to get it to stay.<br /><br />This does not record in HD. Video quality is often spotty and unfocused. I have had clear results and very bad results with choppy footage and frozen frames.<br /><br />I have mine set for 5 min record time but it will not record more than 1 minute at a time no matter what I do. Sometimes it does not even record at all (missing footage when I go back and review my drive).<br /><br />For the price I will keep it until it dies completely. While I have not had to rely on the footage for any accidents it has captured some of the idiots out there on the highways.<br /><br />It also messes with your radio reception.",3,2
"I failed to read the specs again because this is WAY smaller than I thought it would be, even based on pics.  Also, it's VERY flimsy, there are barely any beads in it so it's hard to get it positioned right, and if you're trying to balance it on your lap (or in my case belly!) it's precarious to say the least.  I'm constantly readjusting it which is annoying.  And this is minor, but if you want the cute funky eyes to show while reading, you have to set your Kindle to landscape mode and place it sideways. That's one way the pics are misleading.  And really.....why are there not more fabric options????",3,2
Was ok. Nothing great. Has decent signal strength little static,3,1
i bought it  and it took me a little to understand how to use it but it worked fine I don't recommend to put it on the highest volume because it could get  damaged.<br /><br />the battery works when it wants some days it works some days it wont be able to work disconnected from the computer<br /><br />it is a decent speaker anyway,3,1
Not properly contoured to go around your ear. Also some signal deterioration.,3,2
"The case for the price is a pretty good deal, the construction of it is a little skimpy in the materials aspect. But for the price one can't complain. It's no otterbox, but a good in between until you can get one.",3,1
"I really like this speaker for quality of sound only.  It sounds great!  I would give it more stars but the volume is an issue.  It has no better volume than the volume of your existing laptop speakers.  My volume was low on my Thinkpad and I was hoping that it was a speaker issue but when I hooked this speaker up the volume of the new speaker was no louder than my existing built-in speakers.  There was no volume control on the portable so it was actually no help.  It also has a really bright blue light right in the middle of it so if you sit the speaker on top of your screen, then you have a piercing blue light right in your line of sight.  It might act differently for you but this is my experience.  Also, if you use the paddle to hold it onto your laptop lid, it will stay put as long as you aren't moving your computer about.  If you are moving your computer around, It will not stay attatched.  It will simply topple off.",3,2
"Seems like you get a lot with this package. However, when you start taking into account some of them don't work, or work properly, it really boils down to very little. We've had this set for over 6 months now. First, the setup is not for an amateur. You either need to have this professionally installed, or know a lot about wiring yourself. We did it ourselves, and although we thought we knew plenty, there really is no way to do it yourself in a professional-looking way. It doesn't say this outright in the description, but you cannot just plug this in to your car's lighter plug and be ready to go. You have to wire it yourself into the car's electrical system. Pain in the butt. And to hook the two components together so that you have the functionality it brags about of sharing one DVD with the other screen? NOT user friendly at all.    Second, DVD menus are inaccessible for the most part. You just have to pop the DVD in and it plays what it wants. It will pick up where it left off when you start up again, but sometimes it just won't play at all anymore and the only fix is to take out the DVD and play another one. Then MAYBE your original one will work again, when it feels like it. It is very unpredictable. One of our DVD movies will only play the bonus features and not the movie. And again, no title menu to access to fix it. Very odd.    Third, the \\""wireless\\"" game remotes don't work at all. I mean, AT ALL. Just throw those in the garbage. And even the wired ones are pretty useless. It came with 4 and within a week we were down to one. They are cheap and break very easily.    So, as far as having a DVD system in the car with two separate players - it's great. But keep in mind all the bells and whistles this promises are irrelevant. Would I buy it again? Maybe. Wish I could have spent less on it. Would I get excited about all the extras again? No way.",3,2
"I received the 2 cables that I ordered extremely fast (have prime).<br />So let's start with the charging ability. I charged my iPad and iPhone 5 and it worked great to charge it. Although one of the cables only charges on one side of the cable, not both. I do NOT get the error message about the cable not being certified.<br /><br />On the syncing, it will not sync to my computer at all. It won't even get recognized or even charge it. I tried on a windows PC and on a Macbook and neither has acknowledged the iPhone being connected.",3,2
"I recently traveled on a beach vacation and took my Kindle.  I had previously purchased the amazon kindle leather cover, which I love, but it didn't protect from sand and potential moisture exposure.  I purchased the touring sleeve with the thought that I could slide my kindle with the leather cover inside it.  Unfortunately you can't because the sleeve fits so closely.  It's a small problem but none the less a problem for me.",3,1
This product fits real tight but not sure if it will protect the product against a drop.  Its made out of the plastic that will probably crack if it gets dropped.  But this may keep the iPod from breaking.,3,2
"Tried a pair of these in my car in subwoofer box equal to about 2 cubic ft per speaker. I Hooked a Visonik 350 watt rms amp to them and no matter how I set the levels on the amp I was only happy with these speakers at lower volumes.Tried porting the box and only made it worse.Replaced these in my car with 15 inch audiopipes and was much happier with audiopipes.So then I made larger sealed subwoofer boxes and put the bass15 speakers in them(about 4 cubic ft per speaker)hooked to home stereo and this is where they shined.I would recommend these for large enclosures but didnt want enclosures this large in my car.Also wouldnt put more than 100 watts rms to each speaker.On the home stereo they will stay,so much bass my wife cant stand it.",3,1
"I purchased this speaker with the hopes that it would be a nice alternative to taking bulkier speakers on a vacation with me.  I love the idea that this is small and compact.  You can also hook up more than one at a time; however, I was really disappointed in the sound that came from this speaker.  The sound lacked any sort of base whatsoever. It sounded like it was muffled and coming from a tin can.  It is definitely not something you want if you seriously want to listen to music; but it would be fine to take to the beach, etc.  The Altec Lansing Orbit was definitely a better choice over this speaker, but if you're looking for something cheap and not too worried about sound, then this speaker is for you.",3,1
"I bought this for my new iPod in December of 2010. I received all parts. After a few weeks of use, however, the purple case began to rip near the bottom, where the most stress is. Now, I find it impossible to use because my iPod will slip right out of it. Note: I did not use it with the arm band, that was not the cause of it breaking. This is regular wear. For use only with iPods used lightly.",3,2
"This isn't exactly a review since I haven't purchased one of these; but I probably would if it weren't for one thing: this unit comes with Nickel-Cadmium Rechargeable batteries rather than Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMh). The difference is that NiCad batteries have less capacity, are much less environmentally-friendly, and worst of all tend to develop a &quot;memory&quot; for the the last place they were discharged down to, so that the next time you use them they will only discharge again down to this level, resulting in even less capacity. The commonly recommended antidote to this is to make sure the batteries are fully discharged before you charge them back up again, but this is highly inconvenient. Its hard to understand why Sony did not choose to provide this unit instead with Nickel Metal Hydride Rechargeables.",3,1
"Way too much static and hiss regardless of how many channels I tried.  When in a tunnel without any radio reception, there was no hiss but still the sound was very flat and the volume was very low.  I tried several combinations of volume adjustments and different stations and even different cigarette lighter outlets... not too good.    Remote is not that good - even if you are within 1 inch of the unit.    You have to plug in the unit to the iPod, so it's not a true cradle... not very convenient.    Only good thing is that it turns the iPod on and off as you turn the car on and off and charges the iPod effectively.  I've been using an adapter from the audio jack of the iPod connected to the tape deck so all in all it's not a complete waste - but I would not buy again or recommend.",3,2
"When I ordered this, a picture clearly shown a screen protector, which is why I ordered this, to keep my orders and shipping prices to a minimum. When I got the package, no such protector was included. I then emailed the seller, 2 days later, still no reply. Terrible customer service!!!   The case itself has a good look to it, although the piece or material at the bottom is very flimsy, as well as the kickstand itself feels like its just waiting to fall off.",3,2
Previous model (S10) sounds better.,3,1
"Convenient USB mp3 player port, lacks bass, display disappeared when left in sun but returned. Has analog dial tuner - works ok but strangely old school. I like it well enough. Paid about 75 dollars and like the features.",3,1
I bought this for my daughter. She thinks it's retro cool. It's exactly what the product description says it is.,3,1
"It works for a little while, but obviously for the price, they are not well made and mine stopped charging my phone/iPad within a month or two.",3,2
this is a good little radio. Your voice will sound a little scratchy when using a repeater but it gets the job done. The only bad thing with this radio is that you can not use the kenwood style plug to program this radio. The newer uv-3r will accept the kenwood programming plug. I suggest buying that model even tho it is a little bigger.,3,1
"The swivel function design is kind of strange and a bit useless if your using it in a vehicle.  But it works, has been reliable enough so no qualms there.",3,1
A bit difficult to install.,3,1
"The case fits my player perfectly but it is not as pink as it shows in picture. Way light pink, color looks like chewed up bubble gum :-(",3,1
Had good sound but the Bluetooth connectivity was not the best,3,1
I gave it a five because it works as well as the Apple product for less money and most of all.....a longer length.  The Apple cords are just not long enough.  I am very pleased.  Shipping was quick and on time too.<br /><br />Update: stopped charging halfway through. Disconnected and reconnected now charging again.  Hmmmm.,3,1
"Bought a pair of XS-GTX6931 and received a pair of XS-GTX6932. Discount Jungle insisted that they are a replacement for the former and are exactly the same size. If that is true, these most definitely do not fit my Dodge Ram 07. The speaker basket is too large by 1/4\\"" all around. Even if I butcher the door metal and adjust the magnet to be 1/8\\"" from the glass, the mid-range/tweeter assembly is 1/4\\"" too far out for the door panel to fit over top. DO NOT TRUST THEM when the green \\""fit your car\\"" appears. These speakers may be a great buy, but they do not fit Dodge Ram 06-on for sure.",3,2
These arnt hard hitting they are just OK. nothing really bass pumping. it DOES NOT COME WITH A 1000Watt amp IT IS ONLY 500,3,2
"It's plastic, it fits over your iPod Touch like a glove, it's kinda cheesy looking with it's semi-see-though skin, but I guess elasticity comes with a price. A good protector. Don't know if I'd purchase one again, though.",3,1
"It's a great case but there's not enough room for the power cord. It LOOKS like there should be from the picture, but it doesn't fit.  I have the Nuvi 780 so my cord with the traffic notification might be larger than some others.  The first GPS I had got stolen out of my car so I love the fact that I can put my new one in this case and it slips right into my purse.  If the power cord fit, it would be perfect.",3,1
"I purchased this rain and temperature station (RGR202) on July 23, 2010.  It arrived within a week.  The set consists of a temperature sensor, rain collector and a main display unit.  The Quick Start Guide instructions were very straight forward and easy to follow and it is very important that you follow the instructions to successfully assemble and operate the units.  The temperature sensor is easy to set up but be sure to mount the unit in a shaded area as I have noticed up to a 12 degree swing between direct sunlight and shade, with the shaded reading being the correct temperature.  The display unit is easy to assemble but you will want to take your time in setting the correct time, date, and year.  Pushing the reset button will result in a complete loss of these settings.  The rain collection unit can be a real stinker to assemble and level and quite honestly, in my case, not very reliable.  I am currently working with my THIRD unit.  The original one was an older model that required the removal of several screws to access the batteries, a real pain.  That unit was inaccurate by about half of what the total rainfall was for any one storm.  Oregon Scientific sent me a newer replacement unit (snap on battery door...very nice) but it had electrical problems after establishing communication with the display unit and quit working.  Another phone call and another week and my third unit arrived.  I set this unit up and three days later we had a 1.3\\"" rain storm, and much to my dismay the display unit showed nothing.  A spider had built a nest inside the collector that wouldn't allow the trip bucket to empty.  The nest has been removed and the unit seems to be functioning so now I just have to wait on the weather to see if the third time IS a charm.",3,1
"I bought this case for my personnal Creative Zen.  While the case is made well and has a protective clear cover over the display screen, it isn't very functional when being used.   On the Zen there are buttons around the touch mouse.   With the leather case on, I have a very difficult time using these buttons.  Most of the time, I just slip the Zen out of the case just to fast forward through a song.   Not what I had visioned when purchasing this case.",3,1
they do the trick but wear out very quickly.  Hard to keep from bending them and that is when it will cause the little wires to short out,3,1
I bought this case for my nook and it was great but it had no strap to keep it closed. I also didn't like the snap things you had to put it in. I thought I was going to ruin my nook. Nice case but not for me,3,1
"Got more station than my old antenna, but too much static.",3,1
"It does what it does, which is charge the Zen Vision M quicker than the USB cable would, but it also causes a loud buzzing in the headphones while charging, making it impossible to listen to music while charging the unit.    My best guess is its cheaply shielded and it's electromagnetic noise. I've tried solutions to no avail so buy if you must, but I suggest a higher quality charger.",3,2
I've finally got TV listings.    But where is the button to switch channels?    And help is needed with Advanced Settings,3,1
"Not like the original in terms of the response. I have to fight with it to get it to do what I want. Since I mostly use it as an FM receiver for one channel, not a deal breaker for me, but definitely not as responsive as the original screen was.",3,1
The Garmin mount adapter that came with this unit does not fit on the ball attached to the base. You will need to use the original adapter that came with your Garmin. Other than that this unit works fine. Other folks here have made the same comment.,3,1
Cute! Durable,3,1
I have the Iphone 4s and a Lifeproof case.  The extender is awkward to use with my docking station. Maybe my station is too old. But the fit was just off a bit.  Might work for someone else.,3,2
"This mono speaker puts out good sound for how small and cheep it is.  I love the rechargeable battery and multiple inputs.  The interface is a little hard to read and harder to figure out but works reliably.  The MP3 player does not allow nested folders either so I hope you like random playback, because options are limited.",3,1
"I just got this product and these are my thoughts. I am using this with a USB drive. If you want it to sound better (the sound is not great) turn down the volume on the device to about 10 and work the volume on the radio. When you are playing a song, push pause and go through the different radio stations and find the one with the least amount of static, you will get a clearer sound. If you turn off you car it does not save your place unless you have the cigarette lighters that stay on while the car is off and then you will need to press pause. I am very satisfied for the price. It does what I want it to do and it was under $5 to buy it and get it shipped to my house. If this broke after a year of use I would buy another one.",3,1
"As a buyer of well-over 300 Baofeng radios (and counting) for the group I belong to (not all of which were purchased through Amazon but many were), I'm always amazed at the lengths some sellers go to to hype their products as being \\""newer\\"" or \\""better\\"" than other models, or perhaps (to give them the benefit of the doubt) they just don't know any better.<br /><br />First, the Baofeng UV-5R series (including the original and still extremely popular UV-5R, I'll explain why in a minute) is what is normally referred to by many as a SDR radio (or software defined radio).  While not a true SDR product (you can't use it with your computer to control the radio's functions or scan a wide amount of VHF/UHF frequencies with it), none the less a large chip is programmed on the circuit board built inside each radio.  That chip determines what capability the radio itself can perform.<br /><br />Every UV-5R series radio has the ability to transmit from 136-174 MHz on VHF and from 400-520 MHz on UHF in both narrow-band and wide-band modes (very useful for the occasional FRS or MURS use, which requires narrow-band mode to work correctly).<br /><br />Every model does \\""at least\\"" 4W on VHF/UHF from the factory, but occasionally you'll get a batch that does 4.5W or even 5W out, but the difference between 4W and 5W is minimal at best.  A 4W radio with a better antenna will easily outperform a 5W radio with the standard crappy antenna that Baofeng ships on ALL (including the UV-5RA, -5RAX, and -5RAX+) models.<br /><br />Baofeng DOES NOT program those chips any differently for the UV-5R vs. any other UV-5R series (including the UV-5RA).  Version 307 of the firmware (which is the most current release I have in any of my radios) works EXACTLY the same way as previous older releases of firmware at least back to the 295 release (over a year ago), so any claim from a seller that this release provides additional features (at least from a user's perspective) is simply BOGUS, since the firmware inside both radios have the same features.  In fact, my UV-5R radios with the 307 firmware release is EXACTLY the same radio (inside and within the firmware) as my UV-5RA radios with the 307 firmware release.<br /><br />Second, you CANNOT in any way upgrade the firmware (unless you count buying a different radio and it comes with a different firmware release), so again the claim in the listing from some sellers that you can is simply BOGUS.<br /><br />Third, you can believe that two thinner pieces (glued or screwed together on the faceplate of the UV-5RA) is somehow stronger than one thicker piece of plastic (on the original UV-5R series) if you like (and maybe it is), but I haven't seen that in real-world use from my own UV-5RA units.  The standard UV-5R units that we use seem to hold up just as well (when dropped in the desert dirt or rolling down a hill) as any other Baofeng radio we own and use.<br /><br />Fourth, and my biggest issue with all of the non-standard UV-5RA, UV-5RAX and UV-5RAX+ units, is that NONE of the Baofeng battery accessories (except the little 1800 mAh standard battery) work WITHOUT modification (unless you use a Dremel tool to grind or cut off part of your extended battery that works on the standard UV-5R - but won't work on your UV-5RA, UV-5RAX or UV-5RAX+).<br /><br />Getting new UV-5RA units that don't work with Extended 3800 mAh batteries (without modification) doesn't make my group happy.  That may not bother you, but NONE of the sellers of the non-standard UV-5RA, UV-5RAX, and UV-5RAX+ units ever seem to mention that lack of hardware compatibility in their listings, so buyer beware!<br /><br />BTW, NONE of the \\""AA\\"" or \\""AAA\\"" battery shell packs work on the UV-5RA, UV-5RAX, or UV-5RAX+ units either, so that's 3 different battery accessories (including the 3800 mAh extended battery) that you can't use on these radios without hacking them with a Dremel tool (but they all work without modification on the original UV-5R units).<br /><br />So \\""if\\"" you want a \\""pretty\\"" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (or -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.  Oh, you should see how well that shiny faceplate lights up when a flashlight hits it in the dark, just the thing you don't want for night use.<br /><br />Virtually every guy in our group ends up carrying a standard UV-5R and giving the UV-5RA, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ to the wife or kids, since the wife and/or kids rarely care about the other accessories working and they (the wife and kids) tend to like the \\""pretty\\"" radios, but again there is NO INTERNAL difference and NO EXTRA FEATURES in the UV-5RA, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ units (other than a different looking shiny faceplate) vs. the original and still wildly popular UV-5R (which I refer to as the M16 of radios, as all the accessories you match it up with just plain work).<br /><br />Now you know the real background on these radios.f\\"" you want a \\""pretty\\"" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (or -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.

"the product only has two benefits, first the blue led, second the sound quality is pretty good, not great but pretty good... now for the flaws the item i received is not the item shown in the picture it is similar but not the same the neck is almost a foot long which gets in the way of my cars controls for heat n radio it isnt very flexible and falls over and disconnects all the time it has actually broken the outlet in my car, further more the transmitter in the picture shows that the station channel viewer is slanted on the top so the channel and song can be viewed at the same time but it isnt its horizontal on top so to see the channel u have to unscrew the back turn it over with hopefully not unplugging it then change the channel and re align it which is extremely annoying and dangerous while driving so over all this item isnt so good i just received it and i've already ordered a different one from dlo there products are usually very good luckly this product is only $11 so im not that upset but i am still a little peeved",3,2
"I installed the screen protector as soon as I received my Kindle just to minimize the amount of dust that could get trapped under the screen and sure enough, no dust bubbles.  It did take a steady hand and patience to get it on.  The cloth provided does leave particles on the screen so just view the screen from an angle to see if dust is present before you apply the product.  I suspect dust and air bubbles will always be a problem when applying screen protectors, whether it be this brand or another one, especially when the screen you're covering is relatively large.  Just don't be a perfectionist about it.  And if you are, then maybe a screen protector isn't for you.",3,2
"After looking for days for a new iPad case that was functional but a little girly, I found this one.....and it is exactly what I was hoping it would be!  Effective, flexible and attractive to boot for about half the price of other comparable cases. May buy another color as a spare!<br /><br />Update: Have had the cover now for several weeks.  Downgraded the cover from 5 to 3 stars,,,,,it no longer puts my iPad to sleep when the cover closes. Disappointing.  But still very nice to look at!",3,1
is what it looks. was hoping for a harder front as the one I made myself was of similar quality,3,2
Often its full of static in most cars and its cheaply made but it works and is affordable so I don't recommend it but its okay I guess.,3,2
"I am having trouble getting it to link up with my Kindle, however I haven't given up yet and hoping a friend will help me with it tomorrow. It is a beautiful case and was very much as advertised. I just want it to work so bad is all.",3,1
"This looks nice, and it's wearing well. The only problem with it is the little bump that's right over the reset button on the Nook. When I put it in my backpack, if anything presses against it, it powers down. A couple of times it reset completely and I had to re-register. It looks like they did it deliberately, but I can't figure out why they would do that. I finally got tired of it, and installed it upside down so that button wouldn't do anything, and now it doesn't open like a book, which is a little annoying.",3,1
"Well, the cord does what it is supposed to do.  It plugs my ipod into my alpine deck.  It charges my ipod and I am able to control the volume and skip songs from the deck as well as a couple other features.  However, when your ipod is plugged in you can not access any of the features ON your ipod.  It is a dark screen.  So I can't use the toggle wheel to select albums or choose specific songs.  Once it is plugged into the deck you can only use the deck to control the ipod.  Which means you are relying on the decks limited display and control buttons.  Other than that it's ok.",3,2
"Very nice looking case.  Fits perfectly.  I don't know why they included a strap... there's no place to attach it.  The hard shell cover still causes i pod to slide.  I wanted one of the cases that you can put on your dash and it wouldn't slide.  Price is right, so all in all, good deal.",3,1
"I was really excited for my kindle.  Can it do the same thing my mini computer and my DROID phone can do...yes.  Did I have higher expectations...yes.  Because Im the let's give this kindle a product a chance I didn't send back.  Would I recommend it, eh, maybe.  My original kindle I love bought the very first one, I don't need wii-fi to download from anywhere and with my new one I do.  Wish for at least the price Kindle could have come up with something for that.  If I am on the road with no wii-fi what's the point?  So yes, a lil disappointed but can use it to download movies for my kids for travel for the movies they don't have to play on their portable dvds or maybe while on the plane traveling.  Color is nice but Ill never give up my original kindle!",3,1
like the case- its nice and trendy.  the colours are not quite as bright as the picture shows. but bright enough though.  not a super quality one.. but the kid likes it and it does the job :) .,3,1
"Cute cover, but ours arrived with a flaw.  There was something wrong around one of the magnets inside the cover, the cover was scuffed, scratched, and protruding and looks bad.  Poor QC.  Also the magnets don't do a good job of holding the cover in place very well, they are too weak.",3,2
"I waited a while before reviewing this to see how it held up.  I had no problem connecting via WiFi, but sometimes the sound cuts out and that's annoying.  I wanted to be able to listen in the kitchen while I'm cooking without having to use ear-buds.  I just connect it to my phone or ipod and it works great.  If I only wanted to use it remotely, I might think twice.  I've only used it with WiFi twice.  The sound cut out a few times and since that annoyed me I've just been plugging it in since then.  Perhaps if I'd used it more often I'd have had less problems with the connection.",3,1
These little speakers are awesome. They are loud and give out great sound for being so small. I recommend them to anyone.<br /><br />The headphones on the other hand... The sound was pretty good and they were fairly comfy. But within 4 hours of using them they began to fall apart. I won't be getting another pair of these.,3,1
"\\""This doesnt fit the iPhone 4s. I used all three screen protectors just to get a \\""halfway\\"" decent alignment. You get two back protectors too, but if your phone is in a case you dont really need it.",3,2
Well I bought this case and it lasted for 2 months and then it started to fall apart and the pAint started to chip of and it left white spots. I was furious with this product,3,2
i bought this thinking it was a case to protect the shuffle. it only fits on the front and its a thin little piece of plastic.     update:the seller is dependable and genuinally wants to have happy customers. they refunded my money and i never asked for a refund. i would buy from this seller again.,3,1
"I first reviewed this product and gave it 5 stars.  Now I have no choice but to give it 1 star.  When I plug my phone in, the charging indicator pops up on my phone, but upon further inspection, charging indicator or not, the phone is slowly draining power.  I confirmed this when my phone was low on power, died while charging, and was not able to generate enough of a charge to restart.  I am attempting to charge a single Galaxy Nexus phone.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I have again revised my review from 1 star to 3 to reflect a more neutral total experience.  Although this item did not work for me, I received an automated email from the seller I bought my charger from(Kellys Computer) nearly a month after my purchase asking If I was happy with my purchase to leave positive feedback.  I replied that the charger was not working for my phone and was was promptly replied to on a Sunday night and promised a refund in the morning.",3,2
"We bought this for the 60-odd hours of road trip we had to drive over the holidays. We used it to connect to my iPad, and to his Kindle Fire. It is... well, it mostly works. We discovered after a lot of fiddling that you have to turn down the volume on the device if you don't want the music terribly distorted. Even the best we could get it to sound, the bass comes through way too hard and everything else is muffled - listening to music felt like being underwater.<br /><br />It worked all right for the podcasts, though. Not much bass in those, though the people did sound like they all had colds.",3,1
People love breaking into cars and stealing stereos its ridiculous.The alpine model I got this for it did not fit. UNLESS I shove it in very hard. It had the correct pins but the cable itself was not large enough to fit in. I had to shove this sucker in to work. And you cant pick songs from IPOD you have to put on shuffle and keep hitting next.,3,2
I though it was something other than what it was so I returned it.  It looks a little cheap to me.,3,2
I marked this as &#34;it's OK&#34; as I feel it's somewhat overpriced between the cost of the unit and shipping.  I probably wouldn't have ordered this if I did it over again as it would have been much cheaper to purchase direct from the store.,3,1
I am pleased with this product. Use it. There are no comments. Advise.<br />Happy with my choice. Working. Some times noised.,3,1
"unfortunately i sent my product to the wrong house but i was thinking no big deal, it would get it a little after christmas. well it took just under a month for them to send it back to me after it was returned. not very impressed with the turn around especially since i was able to get a different product back within a week and half from another amazon company.",3,2
"Like all portable players, leaves much to be desired. Good for the battery usiness",3,1
"Overall, the case is solid and will prevent small dents and scratches.  It is not hardend so if you intend to pack it luggage for a flight, recommend you wrap it is clothes and in center of your luggage.  In terms of space, this will only hold your GPS and possibly the power cord.  For my TomTom 540XXL, 5\\"" screen, there is no room for the power cord or mount.  If you want a case that can hold everything, this is not it.  But if all you need is a case to protect the actual GPS unit, this will work.",3,1
fm tuner very limited only plays stored stations......,3,1
So you hook up the red cable to (12+) and the black/red stripe to (12-) ? is that it ?  the power cable are very short while the antenna cable is long . if the radio  is 77&#34; away (antenna cable) why are the power cables 6 inches long ?,3,1
"This case is definitely nice and sturdy. Only issue is you can not plug in the headphones or car audio adapter while it is on. Unfortunately it looks like I wasted my money on this because there is no way to return it. My ipod is always in my car and if I can't use the case with the cord, its completely useless to me.",3,2
"It took longer than I expected to receive. The instructions were no help when I began to download songs. So I ended up erasing a song that I can not reload, because it says the song was already synchronized. The only reason I rated it three stars was the sound quality was crisp and clear.",3,2
No problems,3,1

"This program makes very nice ID cards when paired with a good card printer.  It is fairly easy to learn, well supported with updates, installs without any problems, but has one negative issue which can be overcome.  The online manual, or help system is poorly written and very difficult to find answers to questions on the program's use.  It is fairly easy to learn without a great deal of help, but it has taken almost a year to unearth some features, and quite by accident at that.  The second minor flaw is the ability to have the software direct the files it created to another location.  I have an external hard drive pair set up in a raid array, thereby protecting my data and investment against loss.<br />The major flaw I find with this software is the excessive copyright protection system employed.  The system installs in a trial mode, which by the way, prints out only with the word \\""trial\\"" printed numerous times across the card.  I can understand this, but when the owner of the software goes to keep the software in a usable form by entering the serial code, the software warns that it can only be installed on that one hard drive in that one computer.  That is all well and good until that one computer's motherboard fries (known HP defect) and takes with it the hard drive completely.<br />Re-installing the software and using the serial code generates an error stating that the software can not be reinstalled.  I have effectively been robbed of the copyrighted software I purchased in good faith.  I am hoping that HID software company will come up with a solution to these issues in future releases, and a solution to allow the re-installation of the program.<br /><br />04/16/2014 Update.  HID software was able to reset my security to allow the re-installation of the software.  At least I have the functionality back, and I will be sure to make a backup of my hard drive.  I am still not able to specify a destination for my files, a feature that should be available in any software package, in my opinion.  Using the trial version first, then the registered one, revealed another minor annoyance.  I am not able to batch print, a feature available during the trial, but must print each card individually.  I am changing my overall rating from a 2 to a 3.",3,1
"It works for my LG G3 smart phone, but it doesn't charge very fast and it does last very long.  I've used it while traveling but it seems like it dies after only charging for an hour.  Helps me in a pinch, but doesn't charge/last like I expected it would.",3,1

I have noticed that the power button will no longer power down the unit, but the camera still works fine.  After only about a months use the suction cup broke off.  There is a plastic ring embedded into the suction cup which attaches it to the mount, this ring broke off in the suction cup rendering it useless.",3,2
"I have been tempted by ebook readers for quite a while, but never wanted to drop a lot of money for one. I bought it for $39.99 minus a 20% coupon (the price is on a company's website and in its stores) so got it for $32. I bought two and my daughter may get the other one if she can figure out how to access other books besides Kobo's. It's great for books from Kobo, but I have yet to figure out how to download books from my computer. I have read and re-read the user's manual, but it just says you can use the Literati to read downloaded books. I see from another review that I should download \\""calibre\\"" and I may try that.<br />The color screen is fantastic, the different brightness levels and night reading settings are extremely useful, and the pages turn very quickly once the book loads. I have seen reviews that complain about the page turning not working, etc., but I think those problems were cleared up in the latest firmware. The wireless is great.<br />I do wish it would tell me how it's doing when it's charging, because the manual says not to overcharge it. How do I know when it's charged and when it's overcharged? The initial charge is 6 hours. Should I set a timer for 4 and check it every hour to see if it's charged?<br />Slight problems aside (assuming I can get it to work with other than Kobo,) I think it's definitely worth the money and I really hope I can put other books on it! This is especially true if Borders goes under. Kobo assures me that because the company is Canadian, things will be okay? Can I trust that???? We shall see.<br />Two days later: Okay, all went well for a day. Then I turned on the Literati and it did not load. Called Literati and went through hoops and now I am waiting for a return label and box. I had bought 2 Literati, one for me and one for my daughter. I charged the second one today for about 7 hours and turned it on. \\""Literati\\"" showed up on the screen and then the screen went black. I am now waiting for a second box and mailing label. I am incredibly disappointed and very annoyed, since I worked so hard to get the first machine working and now the second is a total dud. I now have to wait 5-7 days for the labels and boxes and 4-6 weeks for the exchange, although the supervisor at Literati told me to call her when I ship them back and she would expedite the exchange. I have no idea if she can do that or if I should believe her.<br />I guess it's true that you get what you pay for. Had I paid anywhere near full price, I'd return the machines to the store where I bought them, but at $32 apiece, I'll try one more time.<br />UPDATE: It is now many months later. Literati sent me 2 new devices before they even received my defective returns. I have been using them since and am very pleased. I am still sort of waiting for the other shoe to drop, but so far, so good. My public library has two services for downloadable ebooks and both work well with the Literati, using Adobe Digital Editions. It took me a while to realize that PDF books go into \\""Docs\\"" instead of \\""Library,\\"" but I finally discovered that on my library's website.<br />I love that the font can be made larger; it makes this device fantastic when you get your eyes dilated at the ophthalmogist's office! I also like how you can brighten and darken the background. I don't like that it can't be used in the sun, but at the price I paid, I can suffer with that.<br />The instruction manual does not cover everything, but at least it has a manual! I found tech support very helpful, but haven't even needed tech support for many months.<br />So I have changed my rating to a 3. I would rate it higher had I not had the initial problem and frustration.",3,1
"I like the blue color, the texture of the covering, and the look. It's bigger than most speakers and lacks the cube, tube, or block shapes of other Bluetooth types of audio. The set-up is easy, and the buttons are recessed well so to keep the visual attention on the design. The speaker stays upright and has a more solid center; I have tried others where vibrations pull the speaker along!<br /><br />However, the sound is sub-par. Crackling and hiss persisted when I tried this out (as asked) with different sound streams on audio connection with the provided mini-plug. I thought it might be the wire, but I tried another one than the one in the box: same problem.<br /><br />So, while I applaud the design and the intent, the product as provided me for testing is not up to the satisfactory sound level I expect, even for a more modest price point. The booklet admits it may take 8 hours for the speaker to &#34;break in,&#34; but given the noticeable hiss from the speaker, the situation (from my experience with other speakers at this level) appears to demand attention.",3,1

"Despite the fact that the description says that this is a Micro-DVI to VGA adapter, it is not. It is a mini DVi to VGA. This seems to be a common problem when sellers do not understand that there is a distinct difference between the two. The photograph is a mini- and mates with earlier versions of the MacBook or an iBook; not the MacBook Pro. Even when questioning a seller as to their mis-labeling, they may insist that the item is a Mini.  The micro DVI port on the MacBook Pro is compatible with the new Thunderbolt technology.   The seller refunded my purchase price.",3,2
"I have been looking for a personal CD/MP3 player that comes with an AM/FM tuner.  This is the only product that I have found on the market.  Overall I am happy with it, but it does not have the best audio quality.  The sound is a bit flat regardless of source (radio, CD, or MP3).  Also, I notice a very slight hiss when playing MP3's.<br />Good points: CD/MP3 w/ AM/FM, low cost, moderate to good sound<br />Bad points: CD too sensitive without ESP, slight hiss when playing MP3's",3,1
"ok first of all when i got this product i was so excited for it, then i tried it on it felt awesome. a few days past, listening to music trying to increase the volume and decrease it, and man was it hard to do it and also to lock it was also difficult. I sort of recommend thid product",3,2
"This is not a Garmin brand product as the description would lead you to believe - the only writing on it says made in China...  Works fine with my Nuvi 360 but like others have said, the components rattle around inside the case and the wiring is very thin.  Since I was installing this on a motorcycle, I did as another reviewer suggested and opened up the case and hot glued all the components and board inside.  Everything seems secure now and it's working good thus far, but I don't have a lot of confidence in its longevity.  If you want something to just hook up and go you'd be better off buying the Garmin product.  There is a very small fuse on the board (the same that go in the plug on xmas lights) but I still hooked it up through a fuse just in case.",3,1

When I took the MP3 player out, I found that the left arrow button (for turning the volume down and going backwards) didn't work at all.<br /><br />I contacted customer support and they were very helpful. They told me to put the machine in the mail and that they'd send me a new one right away, which they did. I now have a working machine. I had to pay to ship the broken machine back, though, so I feel a little like I paid $3 extra for the privilege of having a working machine. Also, they replaced only the machine, rather than sending me an entirely new package (package comes with headphones and alternate earbuds). Prompt, 3-star customer service. They did the basics; nothing exceptional and nothing to make up for my inconvenience.<br /><br />The machine itself is alright. It's what you expect when you're buying a $30 mp3 player. Nothing too fancy. The sound quality is okay. I don't know that I'd shop from this company again, but I'm not unhappy with my purchase.",3,2
The IPOD is just OK.  It freezes up frequently.  I guess I expected a new product to come without defects. . . . or at least some way to fix it.,3,2
The lightning connector size is not the same size as in the pictures and therefore won't fit many iphone cases. The image shows the narrow style (like Apple's) but is actually the wider style many third party manufacturers are selling. I specifically bought this one because it showed the narrower style.,3,2
It works but even with all the setting correct it still shows lines running horizontally down. they just keep moving down the screen. the user of the screens is not to bothered but it would drive me nuts!!!,3,2

No matter how much you tighten the wench, the weight of the ipad pulls it downward.  It's alright, works, and is worth what I paid for it.  If I wanted something stellar, I could have paid more.",3,1
The end next to plug separated within the first month and you can see wires even though it still worked.<br /><br />Just went to local box store and picked up a more expensive one.,3,2

"The product has a great reputation for quality and performance and I was anxious to have them installed. However, the size was wrong and I had to send them back. A word of advice, if you aren't 100% what size speakers you have in your door panel, reference multiple sources before making a purchase. When I searched amazon for the product, I added my car type and model, amazon confirmed the speakers would fit my vehicle. Unfortunately, amazon was mistaken, 2001 Lexus GS300s have 4&#34; speakers in the door panels, NOT 6.5&#34;. Crutchfield.com offers a more accurate assessment with their &#34;Outfit My Car&#34; tool, you can also call your dealership or just remove the panels yourself to confirm.",3,1
"This product is easy to use and works well if there are few strong radio signals.  In a city where there is a station on almost every frequency, it just doesn't cut it.  The sound is crackly and full of static even if there is no clear station at the frequency.  Nearby channels seem to interfere.  I suspect it puts out a week signal and needs a completely clear channel to work.",3,1
"The product is sufficient, however I wish it was a tad bit larger.  It is a really tight fit placing the cords in the case, but it will work - especially for the price.",3,1
Hard to put on the device. Ended up taking it off.  Insert says it is washable & reusable. There were air bubbles I could not get out using the enclosed soft card. Maybe I'll try again sometime if I find out what to clean it with. My fault... Not the fault of the product.,3,1

If I lock it onto HD then the sound cuts out frequently. The HD sound is great, but the signal varies with distance from the station and among tall buildings. An undocumented feature is the radio picks up the one HD station on AM here. I find that the AM tuner is very weak and won't pick up weak signals as well as the radios in my other cars. Another annoyance is there is no way to keep the time displayed if the radio is off. You can only display the time for a few seconds by pushing the display button. All the secondary buttons are teensy.",3,1
i wanted this for my birthday and my sister purchased it for me...it looked stylish and great and cool but when i tried to connect it to my laptop i only got a few songs....its ok i guess,3,1
"I've ordered 2 of them on official rocki web site. 1 of them died after 3 days.. Still no answer from the support after 1 week.<br />Otherwise the device is working fine for spotify connect. It is still a bit buggy, the initial setup is not straight forward and once the device did a reset to default setting by itself, I had to go through the buggy setup once again..",3,2
"I bought this unit for my motorcycle and it worked great for one season, that is until I got a little damp during a rain I rode thru. Then it started to act up. First the volume went way up and I could not turn it down. All the buttons were useless. I couldn't switch the unit off or change stations or change songs on my SD card. So I figured it was toast. Then when I got home, I took the unit out and let it sit under a 40 watt light to dry the unit out, and after a day, it worked perfect again. That is until this riding season. The unit came on and everything works, except there is no sound coming from the speakers. After hours of checking connections, speakers, etc. nothing, no sound what so ever. And I noticed the cooling fins on the side of the unit were extremely hot (couldn't even touch it) which never happened before. So it's toast. Time to order another model. I'm going to try out the Boss Audio 612UA and see how that works. Of course now I will have in a sealed case so it won't get wet.",3,2
"Lifeproof cases are the next big thing for iPhone 4's. Completely waterproof, shockproof, and form fitting, they make otter boxes seem pointless. If you get one, this is the only dock extender that will work for a Lifeproof case. Unfortunate, because these aren't the best. I bought two. One did not work right out of the box. The iPhone said it was not supported and no sound would transfer through it, although it did charge. This happened on every accessory I tried connecting it to. It wasn't user error because the other one worked fine, for now... Trying to get a replacement for the defective one now.    Another thing is that these don't even go all the way on the dock or any standard 10 pin connector. It's like they're a little too short. Not a big deal but adds to instability, so I can see why other reviewers have said they fall apart. If you press on your iPhone screen while this is on a dock, you're really stressing this thing, just asking it to break. Solution? Buy the Sendstation dock extender with this, and use the send station back brace with the radtech. It helps reduce the stress. Another plus to the sendstation, aside that it's not defective right out of the box, is that you can use it to dock iPads too. The brace is just barely stable enough to hold it up, but it works.     If you don't own a Lifeproof case, there really is no point in buying this. Just get a sendstation. It cost about the same, or less, has the brace, and I've had no problems with it not working. I have two of them too.    Putting all the weight of the phone, and your fingers pressing the screen, on this little plastic radtech adapter sticking out of your dock, well...you take a guess how long it will last. If it even works correctly. Still, this allows me to use my Lifeproof case on a dock so 3 stars just for that.",3,2
"case is good for protecting your iPod but you have to notch out the blue plastic piece with a scalpel to insert the headphone cable fully, and you have to fish the headphone wire through the hole in the bottom of the carry case thingee before you can snap the iPod into the case and then it faces your body and you can't adjust the songs, etc. while you are working out because the wire is run through the case and the iPod is facing your body, just a pain to use unless you are gonna put it on and leave it. Also, the plastic that covers the touchscreen is way too soft and scratches very easily.",3,1
"cheap and cheesy, this thing works pretty freaking good i must say, i use it with a two gig sd card stuck in the bottom, and as a basic mp3 player. when i first hooked it up i thought it was terrible sounding but then i realized i had to turn the volume up on the remote then it works fine. it has built in eq modes, but as is often the case with such the normal mode sounds the best. cant beat the price for what it does me gusta mucho.",3,1

"Depending on what kind of music you listen to these are either OK or really good.  The tweeters work well for slow, classical, jazzy type of music.  If you want to listen to hard rock, metal you will be disappointed.  I've had these in my car for going on 7 years now and have always been disappointed with the power capability.  As soon as you turn them up they start to distort (did this since I first got them).  I'm finally looking at replacing them.  Tired of listening to them crackle at high volume.<br /><br />They are OK.  I would not recommend them to a friend.",3,1
So far so good; but these things usually last a year & then kaput. So we'll see. One complaint I do is that the cord could be longer. My outlet is about 6 feet from where I use my laptop & the cord is stretched & the adapter is sometimes in the air when I use it.,3,1
"I own a Hyundai Tuscon and it came with a special adapter for the iPhone to allow charging and iPod options.  Ofcourse the Lifeproof case doesn't work with it so I ordered this adapter cause it was much better priced then the Lifeproof one.  However, when I have the phone plugged in, the ringer nor the text message sounds (or any phoen sounds) work, even when not on silent.  I don't want to waste the $30 on the lifeproof one, but also don't want to miss important text mesages (like traffic updates) while in the car.",3,2
"The seller shipped super fast, the screen protector was a great disappointment. It was a universal one from japan and it clearly was misrepresented in the fact that it goes on dust and bubble free. All 4 of my friends all have the same issue as i did with this screen protector. Even as i type i see bubbles once again forming. Now i am not the greatest applier of these screens but all 5 of us?...i don't think so. The silicone skin is a nice fit and the armband is ok as well. The wall charger was a good add as well. But hey i guess the saying that you get what you pay for holds true.

When i first got the boombox i was amazed on the quality of it.

It would be perfect if it didn't take 24 hours to charge and then only last for 3 hours for the first few times, then two hours fully charged, and now it barely lasts for two hours fully charged....and takes forever to charge......I have not even had it a year.",3,2
"The case looks like it does in the picture. It comes in two pieces, front and back, and snaps on around your iPod. After only a few days, mine is already covered in scuffs and scratches from I-have-no-idea-what. I guess that's my fault, but I'm pretty gentle and careful with my iPod, so it's safe to say that this thing picks up marks easily. Like, fingernail easy. Also, while the cover is snug and doesn't feel like it's going to fall off, I find that crumbs and specks of stuff accumulate on the sides and back, so I've been taking it off and cleaning it out every few days.",3,1
"Not bad if you can get it for less than 20.00, but it does have it's problems/cons.<br /><br />The usb cord that came with it was bad right out of the box- looking on some forums, I discovered that this is a common problem.  Luckily I had another one handy.<br /><br />The sound quality is decent but nothing special (the bass cracks at full volume on certain bass-ey songs).  Same for the battery life- okay but not great-between 4-6 hours or so.<br /><br />It is very counter-intuitive to use- the way that you scroll through songs must have been designed by an engineer who could not read English very well, as the buttons do not do what they imply they would- it is navigable though, once you get used to the bizarre design.<br /><br />In this price range (meaning 20 dollars or less) I think you would get a better value for your money with a used riptunes 8gb mp3 player-I have one of these as well, and it has both a longer battery life and is easier to use.<br /><br />If you are willing to spend a bit more (30$ OR SO), I would recommend a used Sansa clip instead",3,2

"I like the sub, it is a great sub by all means. I paid $159 after shipping and handling for this sub and it is rated at 600wRMS. The only down side with it is the SoundQuebed HDS315 is $149 without shipping and I would guess $159 with and it is rated at 1200wRMS..... That says something to me. It says I over paid for a sub that is rated lower than what I could get from the actual company. It is my fault for not checking with the actual company first but still... take it as you like but I would rather pay just as much to the actual company for something that is rated higher. The sub itself is actually just an old Audio Que with a SoundQuebed dust cap. So essentially they took the old Audio Que 15 that was discontinued when the company changed their name and they stuck a dust cap from the new company and stuck it on top.",3,2

"I got this in the hopes of using my onlive account at my friend's house. First thing I have to say is if you are planning to hold your phone while using this, good luck. I haven't found a single MHL adapter that allows you to hold your phone comfortably while a heavy HDMI and micro usb are dangling from it. Some apps and games have trouble with MHL adapters, losing audio or video randomly. Mostly it happens with demanding games and resourse hungry apps.<br />Second, the output resolution will be the same as your phone's screen so the Sensation 4g will not output HD res to your HDTV. The quality is noticeable with onlive and netflix. It's kinda wired with how it switches from portrait to landscape too, and sometimes I lose<br />audio or video for a minute when I open an app and it switches from portrait to landscape.<br />I have issues running onlive with Bluetooth onlive game controller on the 32\\"" HDTV at my friend's house. It seems like it is too demanding my phone and I can't tell if the lag is from my phone trying to do so much or my friend's internet or onlive. Anyway, I can't play like that for long since the phone will overheat.",3,1

"The silicone skin looks great when it arrives in its packaging, but I had a heck of a time trying to get it to fit on my Vision:M; the M is quite thick, owners are aware, and the skin is just a hair too tight--just a hair, maybe all but two millimeters. This would be forgiveable if the effect was simply cosmetic, but the lack of slack actually keeps the four large buttons on the front stuck in their pressed positions. Another result is that the two nodes at the top corners of the screen opening are pulled away from one another very slightly, but just enough to make it impossible to attach the plastic cover. I struggled and stretched and pulled and pushed to try to get enough slack around the front of the device, but unlike the other two satisfied customers, I had no luck. I have yet to try blow-drying the cover to get it to expand, but whether or not it works, I'd be worried about what happens when I take this thing to the cold mountains...<br /><br />As for the adapters, the car charger is excellent, but frugal buyers should be aware that the product name's inclusion of the word \\""Travel\\"" AC Wall Charger is to be taken seriously; it's quite short, perfect for a quick charge atop the hotel room dresser, but not so great for any other room situation. If you're looking to save a few bucks by buying this bundle and using its AC adapter for home use, where you may or may not have several feet between the wall socket and your chosen resting place for the player, you're probably better off buying the Creative AC adapter. (Yeah, they should have included it with the player, but you can't have everything, I guess...)<br /><br />On the positive side, I ordered this bundle on standard shipping, and these guys ship, like, immediately. Try your luck with the cover; these other reviewers are obviously satisfied.",3,1
"I have a 5th generation iPod nano and it fits well into this holder. It's a pretty sturdy holder and seems to be a bit vented on the thick sides, good for when you're sweating.  However, if this is flipped upside-down the iPod falls out. And I have to Velcro the strap super tight to my arm since there is no stretch to the band. What I do like about it is the navigation circle on the iPod is open completely so you can easily hit Play, Next, Menu, etc.  For now I switch back and forth between this arm band and my old one since my old one stretches.<br /><br />As a note, I initially got a broken one in the mail. I emailed the vendor and they shipped a brand new one at no charge. THIS is what good customer service is and how you keep your customers.",3,1

I have the IG-B05 mounted near the center point of the handle bars as close to the frame as possible to avoid vibration. The stem is long enough for it to vibrate the GPS so much that its hard to read and use and it vibrates enough for the small GPS (Nuvi 255) to tilt down. If the stem was adjustable, this might solve the problem. I saw that i-Trek has a shorter version but now cant afford another item for this use.",3,1
"WARNING:  The SD card that came with my Blackvue was infected with Conflicker.B Trojan.  Before you plug ANY strange software into your PC make certain autoplay is turned OFF, and scan the new device with a good anti-virus scanner.  In my case, Windows Security Essentials (Free) detected the trojan and removed it. After that all seems well.<br /><br />As for the dashcam itself, it arrived in very nice packaging, everything in English and very professional looking.  Setup in the car went flawlessly with plenty of length on the supplied power cord for hiding it under the roof and door trim around to my center console cigarette lighter.  Although, since the input pin on the cam is labelled for 12V input, I wish there was an option to buy a cable that fit the power socket on the cam and then could be direct wired into the car's 12V electric system.  Even the available BlackBox Pro battery protector has the dashcam going through a lighter plug.<br /><br />Getting the Cam to connect via WiFi to the android app seems a bit finicky, though I'm starting to suspect that it may just be that I'm too impatient.  If I try to connect as soon as the voice notification that normal recording has started is over, I can't get a wifi connection without trying multiple times.  If I keep trying, after a few minutes it connects and everything is fine.  If I wait 5-10 minutes after turning the camera on, then it connects much quicker.<br /><br />The video quality is great.  The unit does get warm to the touch during operation, but with the vent holes, cools rapidly once powered down.

It's not great on the nook, maybe it's just the touch screen itself. I found it better to use my finger to touch Nook color than use the stylus. Don't imagine that stylus could something you could use like a graphic pen that allow you easily draw things on the nook (using painting program), no, it's not very good to be used like that.

"So Lanzar has a big glue problem. They always don't use enough, I bought the 6.5 max pro series and guess what? the voice coil is half glued.

I also don't like how lanzar doesn't post any RMS ratings. The rms is 600.<br /><br />I bought four 15&#34;. They all have half glued coils. Its SUPER annoying and loud. But it gets loud and doesn't sound that bad. It gets pretty low in hz for 50 odd dollar subs. I would use these for ported or bandpass, These have some pretty stiff spiders, so not a lot of movement. Over all, i would rather try to go for something a little more quality.",3,2
"Well, while it's obviously not the best 2-way radio ever made, I'd argue that it's pretty decent.It stands up well to my Uniden walkie talkies, which is pretty good given the price of these radios. The small size makes it alot easier to carry than other walkie talkies, and it's really light, which is really nice, since some walkie talkies are bulky and a pain to carry around. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone that uses these on a day-to-day basis, but for the weekend camper or the kid who plays army these are pretty good walkie talkies. I don't know much about how robust they are, I definitely wouldn't recommend dropping them though. I've treated mine pretty well for about 6 months now and they work fine. At a lakehouse, me and my friend decided to go across the lake and see how far we could go before losing contact with the other radio. I was surprised, we got around I'd say a mile and a half to two miles, which is pretty decent. Don't expect the advertised 10-mile range, I don't think you'll ever get more than a few miles out of these. Overall, they're pretty good 2-way radios, they have all the standard features you'd expect on a modern walkie talkie, and they're pretty easy to use. Treat them right and they should last you a good while.",3,1

They help block out ambient noise and conversations ;)<br />Cons:  They make my ears hot after about 20-30 minutes of use.<br /><br />Amp<br />Pros:  Help drive the headphones with more power/base, although I find my mbp has enough power anyways.<br />Cons:  Because it uses the audio jack, there are noisy picks and such from the computer that come through the audio signal.  I highly highly recommend getting a USB amp which will give you a much clearer audio.  I didn't notice the noises from the amp at first, but after a couple days of use I started noticing them and from that point on I decided not to use the amp anymore because it corrupts the quality of the music.<br /><br />Hope this helps.",3,1
"its ok.I can't get it off!Not a good case if you want to go back and forth. Also, the top coating has rubbed off after a while",3,2
"Ehh its okay, its charges my nano in an hour but then in like two hours my nano needs recharging, its definitely inferior to the apple charger, its okay I guess for short term use but you will constantly be charging your devices with this. Inferior product overall",3,2
The mount is well constructed and seems like it would be easy to install. However i did not realize the mount needed the original valentine mount as well in order to work. The suction cup works great an has not fallen off once.,3,1
"I bought this watch because of the claim of being the thinnest watch ever made.  But this watch is substantially thicker at the center than at the diameter; nearly 6.5 millimeters as measured with precision calipers.  I'm not sure what \\""Diameter less than 2 millimeters thick\\"" means in its ads.  That disappointment aside, the watch is very attractive and presents nicely on your wrist.  It does lack a seconds hand which you may miss if you're trying to take your pulse.",3,1
There ok but not what iexpected. I was thinking they would be more durable and thicker. But for the money they are ok.  I bought two so i have changes of color,3,2
I just opened my package and was all ready to install it in place of my other dvd player that fell apart and it's too small!  Te hole in the ceiling that was made for the other DVD player is several inches too big.  So now I have to figure out how to cover it up. Also there were no instructions in the box and the ones I found online are worse than useless about how to install it.  I'll post my review if I ever figure out how to get it installed.,3,2
PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT FOR THE LIFETIME MAPS!! .NOT ABLE TO USE ACTIVATION CODE HAVE TO PAY FOR MAPS NOT WHAT WAS ADVERTISED,3,2
"I took very good care of this charger. It was never dropped, thrown, or spilled on. Despite careful treatment, device worked well only for the first 2-3 months but then suddenly stopped being able to charge anything. Device would not turn on any longer. From my experience, only reliable for short term use. I admit, it came in handy for my vacation. For the very low price, it's decent but definitely not a long-term investment so be aware.",3,2

I like to wear my running shoes occasionally when i'm not running. This is bulky and looks stupid and is too much of a hassle to take on and off.,3,2
not very loud on Bluetooth OK when on wire with interference from speaker,3,1
I purchased this by clicking the lick through batteryfly and as the title says its the batter and a tool for a zune 120 gb.  i received the battery fine but never got the tool needed to be able to install the new battery.,3,1
"fit perfect of course, but be careful when removing my girlfriend ripped one of them",3,1
I'm late and that's what I liked qe that if you put it that will come on December 6 has to come but I can not,3,1
Only had it for a few days and so far its pretty good.  Video is decent and in day light you can read license plates in cars in front.  Haven't use it in the dark to comment.  My only issue is there seems to be some audio issues with the mic when driving.  I get intermitten grabage but only when driving.  It doesn't give the same noise when outside the car and under similar use.  perhaps RF interfernce with the radio or somthing.  I dont care much for the audio so not a concern to me.,3,1
"The soft plastic protective case is OK but slips off easily.  The \\""protective\\"" cover for the glass front had poor directions and I was unable to get it on properly and had to toss it.  It was basically a piece of thin plastic film.  Chargers are a good deal and shipping was fast....but I was hoping for something that would have been easy to use for protecting the glass front.",3,2
"I had to return the first package because one of them was defective and only charged from one side. The replaced one seems to be working for now, I think for the price they are good but did not like the reliability of it!",3,2
"Everything fit perfect except for the screen protector, that did not go on well at all.  I can't get the bubbles out & there is lint on the back side of the protecctor.  that isn't good at all.",3,1
Brought for my daughter and she loves it. The only thing is that when she plays it with her the volume isn't that loud but it plays great with her laptop.,3,1
"Everything in the picture arrives in the package. However, quality is certainly not what I hoped for. Also, had I thought about it for maybe 30 seconds more, I would have gone to eBay and bought only the items I am really going to use. I think I would have used the hard clear case if it didn't have the honking huge non-removeable belt clip (think Batman utility belt) sticking out of the back of it. Car charger - maybe. I'll throw it in the glove box in case the need arises. House charger? Nope. Never. Just go to the laptop. Headphone splitter and extra headphones may come in handy after I retire and start taking bus trips with my wife. Final analysis is I just got my touch, and I wanted to dress it up. This stuff is everything advertised, and the price if broken down is about fair, but the bottom line is you'd have to be the mother of all ipod dorks to ever need all his stuff. So, the laughs are on me. Just ask my wife. 25 bucks better spent on Guinness.     Nov 16 - after 2 weeks - neither charger works, retractable usb cord doesn't work, not worth my time to pack up and send back. This is a package of cheap junk.",3,2
"It stopped working after so many uses. It was a great price, but not worth it if it stopped working.",3,2
Purchased quite a few (about 75).  About 2% will start smoking on first use.  Others appear to work just fine.,3,1
I think it has some good and bad points. It works fine on a I Live Model number ISP122S. But I also own a Logitech S715i rechargeable speaker docking station and it doesn't work it only charges. It may or may not work on your docking station.,3,2
"When I first got my case, I was excited to put it on my iPod. The flowers are pretty bright, and stand out. Unfortunately, after I had put it on my iPod and held it in my hand, the corners scratch me and are VERY sharp. It's a shame because it's such a pretty case.",3,2
"I picked up this armband for my iphone 3gs, mostly because its pink.  It works well enough, might be too big but again, it works.  I have to take the cover off of my iphone for it to slide in and the part that holds the phone came away from the band on a corner, so its not well made.  For the price though, this will work.",3,1
I purchased this in august of 2014.The sound produced is my favorite of all my Bluetooth speakers.Music played is both loud and clear.My negative issue with this speaker has become apparent only this month (march 2015). I used to get at least 8 hours of playtime with this speaker.It has been gradually tapering off playtime the last moth or so to about 4 hours.I do use it daily but now have to charge it halfway through the day.,3,1
"You never know what can happen while driving your car, so having a video recorder can be a handy device to capture any event while behind the wheel.<br /><br />The Dostech HD 720P Dash Cam is an affordable entry level car dash camera that provides a simple recording method.<br /><br />It comes with a car Charger, a mount (suction cup), a USB cable which connects to your computer to transfer the video, and a remote control.<br /><br />Some nice features include a rotating camera (340 degrees) which can capture the road ahead, the sky, or yourself driving.  The video is nice and clear during the day and can be powered on automatically when the car starts and powered off when the car is turned off.  To record you will need a TF card (not included) and supports up to 32gb.<br /><br />This device does have some room for improvement.  The box mentions some form of night vision but it does not really perform well at all in the dark, unless something is lit up.  Also the mic for sound is subpar.  The camera seems to only record at 720p/30 FPS in AVI format.<br /><br />To sum-up I would say this dash-cam video recorder is for someone who is interested in recording strictly video in their car at an affordable price.  It's a simple piece.  This could be handy for a parent who wants to be able to see their children in the back or just wants an additional level of safety or insurance while behind the wheel.  This could also be handy if you are on a trip or driving and would like to record the surroundings or scenery.<br /><br />For these reasons I give this product ★★★ out of 5.<br /><br />BTW, this item was provided in exchange for unbiased review. Having been a customer of Amazon for well over 10 years, I read reviews to help me find the best products for myself and my family.

"The ear cushions are a great product, and work good once I can get them to seal up, I think I need a larger size. I don't know if they come in different sizes.  Once they are sealed the noise reduction is amazing. I work in a knife shop making knives, so the noise level is very high, grinders, vaccum system, sand blaster. Once sealed the volume on my mp3 player can be turned down to about 1/2 of what it is with stock cushions. The great thing is that these cushions don't take any thing away from the sound, some I've tryed reduce the bass. I will be checking into a larger size.",3,1
"For the price, the clip-Dat Mini clip MP3 player provides good sound, easy pick up from the song you left off on, and convenience of portability. The biggest issue I have had with this product is that when inserting the headphones, or pressing the fast forward/rewind buttons, the pressure causes the micro SD card to pop up/out and has to be reinserted. The product I purchased did not come with the USB-HSD cord, luckily I had a spare one to attach to it. The player does not work or even read without the micro SD card,and  because there were no instructions, I found this out through trial and error. A plus is that this device can support up to a 8GB micro SD so I can have a large selection of music at my fingertips..",3,2
"Here's the product description:  \\""Sony Walkman Portable All-in-one Skip-Free CD Player - Digital AM / FM Radio Tuner, Clip Style Earbud Headphones, 40 preset FM stations, Digital Mega Bass Sound, AVLS & CD-R/RW Playback\\"" and it's manufactured by Sony, a company that has heretofore been among the best in the industry for outstanding products.  The purchase price was more than $54.00 and the exclusive planned use was for playing CDs, both commercial and self made.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1.  The unit does not skip when moved around or bumped which is related to the skip free G protection.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1.  The battery access door is flimsy which makes it difficult to insert and remove batteries when replacement is required<br />2.  The unit does not include an AC adapter which has to be purchased separately<br />3.  The ear plugs which are provided with the product are useless. We had to purchase another set with a different, more functional style.  The ear bud piece would not stay in the 'over the ear' piece, making it impossible to use.  The product includes an over-the-ear device for each ear with an open groove for the ear bud wires.  However, the retention within the grooves is almost nil which allows the wires to continuously separate from the over-the-ear devices.<br />4.  The CD lid does not open up far enough to allow for the insertion or removal of the batteries.  The battery compartment is almost too small.",3,2
cute holder for Beats Pill speaker but the back end hole covers up the (barely visible) push button controls...<br /><br />they should have made the hole a little bigger!,3,2

"My last camera of this type had menu in Chinese & only mode I could work was zoom. This was at least in English but No direction on menu access or use so it becomes challenging.

"I purchased these speakers to use with my computer at work. The computer's internal speaker was not loud enough to hear my boss speak while using Google Hangouts for remote meetings. I purchased these speakers so I could amplify the sound a bit and add some personality to my desk.<br /><br />Pros:<br />These speakers definitely add the desired personality and come with a sound amplifier. I really like that the amp can be powered by either batteries or a USB cord- it's nice to have options. The speakers give ample volume control, so hearing people on Google Hangouts is no longer an issue for me.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The major con is that when adjusting the volume at the amplifier, the sounds cuts out back and forth between the two speakers. Not only do I have to find a desirable volume level for the sound, but if I want sound out of both speakers simultaneously, I need to adjust it perfectly. Also, the speakers could have used a bit more design in terms of table top stability. Something like sand bags in the turtles' butts would prevent the speakers from falling over while retaining the &#34;plush&#34; look and feel of the speakers.<br /><br />Overall, these speakers serve their purpose and serve it well. My expectations for quality were pretty low and the fact that the speakers look like turtles was the primary factor when deciding to purchase these. If the price had been 33% less, the quality would be more acceptable and I'd give an extra star.",3,1
"Purchased this item due to my wife using my Garmin 255. This GPS took me on a dirt road for 18 miles during a snow storm when I could of traveled on a highway all the way. The unit advised me that destinations were on the left, when they were on the right hand side of the street. Lost single multiple times during my 11 day trip. This never has happened with my 255. The unit did however provide good directions to most of the locations I visited and saved a lot of time. If I was to do it again, I think I would purchase a new unit rather than a refurbished unit.",3,1

The advanced app mode is glitchy, but the unit is still awesome.It just might not be worth the money for some. The 4400 might be a better choice.

"ok I'm using this thing in an unsupported Linux environment, but basically it works. Plug it in and it appears as a USB drive, drag and drop mp3 files onto the device. They play fine. <br /> <br />The battery life is good, a day's play no problem, the capacity is 20Gb and it can handle any type of file so is useful for data transfers between machines etc. It's capacity actually makes audio books worthwhile though it doesn't play Audible's .aa files. <br /> <br />Audio quality is very good, but the earphones you get with the device are cheap, get a decent set. <br /> <br />The user interface on the player kind of sucks. It profiles the M3s into genre, year, artist, album etc based on the mp3 tags, so make sure they're correct or it's a mess to use. If you use Linux, get hold of easytag and set all the tags correctly or use something like Grip which will fill the tags in from freedb. <br /> <br />The big niggle and why it's only getting 3 stars is that you can't play music *while it's charging*. If you try to, it crashes with loud buzzing and has to be switched off/on. It's been back to the manufacturer with the problem but it still exists. This is stupid and down to poor quality control, it makes the car charger useless and it means I can't play music while transferring stuff to it. It just doesn't multitask. Otherwise, when not charging, it's actually reasonably reliable for me. The little niggle is it can't create playlists of it's own, you have to create them on the attached system and copy them with the mp3 files, again something like easytag or rhythmbox can create playlists. <br />",3,2

There's too much interferance, otherwise. The charger...? Not so much. It's a really novel concept, just lacking in the execution.

"The Gomadic FM transmitter is a great idea.  It allows you to use any music device (iPod, smart phone, MP-3 player) to transmit it's music over your car radio using the FM tuner.  All you need to do is plug your device into it using the headphone jack, find a \\""quite\\"" FM station, tune the device to that frequency, and listen.  The audio quality is pretty good and the loudness is controllable by both the device and the car radio.  They even offer several charging adapter cords for use with multiple devices.<br /><br />Now for the bad.  I have had two such units.  The first, ordered to use with an Android phone for playing music in my Tahoe, simply fell apart after several months of use.  The plastic case is of sub par quality and I reglued it several times.  But the device simply stopped working one day and was never again usable.  I also noticed that it imposed a high frequency \\""hum\\"" over the radio when the charging cord was used.  Unplug the charger and the hum stopped.  A minor inconvenience.<br /><br />Fast forward to my second unit, now ordered for an iPhone.  This one seems to be holding up better, but the hum is still there.  Apparently there is an unfiltered component in the charging circuit that is present in all units.  This is a poor design and the results are very annoying.<br /><br />So, overall, I give it three stars, as it is a great idea that works well, at times.  But a little better manufacturing would have gotten it five stars!",3,1
This amp will work well if you use is to plug into small surround sound speakers or bridged/crossover to a single bass diver. Simple remote-controlled mild-bass. When you push the bass on larger drivers distortion appears quickly. The Mp3 player is ridiculous... seriously bad sound. The radio works. The simpler lepai sounded a bit better to my ears. I payed 35$ but would but a 20$ value on this one.,3,1

"I am very happy with the Mivizu case. It is made of hard plastic with a rubberized coating that, so far, is holding up very well. I have a couple of complaints. The first case I received arrived with broken and damaged tabs on the top part which fit into the bottom part of the case along the middle sides. These are rather weak. Be careful to inspect the case when you get it to make sure these little tabs are intact. The case slips on nicely however, there is about a millimeter of separation from the top part with the bottom. Hopefully Mivizu can correct it because it allows a bit of the iPod chrome to show through on each side, especially the front. After trying out the case, I wrapped my iPod with invisible shield (which I've used in other products). After it was ready, I reinstalled the Mivizu case and it fit very snug, which I liked. I needed to use a small file to make the rectangular whole on the back of the case a bit larger so that the tab would be able to click into it. Other than that, I like the feel of this case and the price is great. I would recommend it. Without the invisible shield, the Mivizu case is not as snug and there is a TINY bit of wiggle when using the iPod.",3,1
"This is not made for the NOOK glow! The standard nook has divots in the case for the plastic clips on the case to lock into. The glow has a rubber bumper around it, the clips can hold onto it, but not well, and it bends the bumper. The case is good but NOT for the NOOK GLOWlight",3,2

"I like the case and the protective screen cover.  But I cannot figure out how to use the belt clip (how does it fasten to the Fuze case?)

That's my only complaint, so if someone can post the \\""how to's\\"" that would be much appreciated.",3,1
"I thought I'd read carefully enough and was ordering a Nook Color-compatible charger that would provide the fast charge I get with the cable that came with my Nook. This product turned out to be a regular Nook charger with a shorter adaptor than that on the original Color cable. It charges the Nook Color but very slowly (overnight as opposed to a few hours). A tech agent at Gomadic says they're trying to come out with a Nook Color fast charger but are having some problems getting the manufacturing set up.     I ran into the same problem with a travel charger (B&N) I bought with the e-reader, thinking it was fully compatible with the Color model. BTW, when these slower chargers are used, the Nook will say it's not charging but if you check, you'll see the battery level going up slowly.     At this point, the only fast charger I've been able to find is the one that came with the Nook Color.    Otherwise, I love my Nook Color, especially with the software update that's turned it into an Android tablet, albeit not as fully functional as the units marketed as tablets.

"I'm a beginner DYI car guy and this was my first set of aftermarket speakers.  I have a Honda Fit 2012 and installed the entire set.  The Honda Fit has tweeters mounted on the dashboard instead of in the front doors, so a component system is optimal for the car.  I have also previously replaced the stock head unit with a JVC A925 before installing these.<br /><br />What I've found is compared to the stock speakers, the bass is cut in half.  It was VERY disappointing.  My old speakers had a lot more bass, but it was unrefined and at times 'motorboating' due to the cheap quality speakers.  The tweeters on this set are disturbingly bright.  Even with my crossover and treble set low and the bass boost all the way up, the treble coming out of the tweeters is too much.<br /><br />That being said, these speakers do refine the sound compared to the stock speakers and if you listen to certain music with treble, like classical music, these speakers would be a great buy.  However, more bass-heavy music like rock, metal, techno (all of which are my preference) these speakers do NOT deliver.  I plan on saving up some money and moving these speakers to the back seats and replacing the front two with more expensive bass-heavy speakers such as (from what I've read) Massive RK6 components.",3,1
"The product does what is says, but don't be expecting a premium sounding device. The signal quality is poor and is hard to get a clean reception with it. I tried many different available stations in my area and would get a variety of whines and hums. If i was traveling in rural areas it would get better, but tolerable at best. I like being able to just insert an SD card full of music and plugging it in my cigarette lighter and leaving the ipod behind. The controls are difficult on the unit, but it comes with a remote (unless you lose it like me).  All in all a decent buy, just don't get your hopes up too high.",3,2
"Very reliable product.I ordered this alarm for my car and is working fine although the picture quality is not very good but over all is working fine but the picture quality need improvement.Good product,shipping was longer than expected but l received it at long last.One of the remote was bad but they sent me another one.",3,1
I am glad I have a mount now.  It is not the same quality as the original one was.  It falls off of the windshield after a while and it does not stay up like the other one did that was made by Magellan.  I still am happier that I have a mount and glad that the cost was less too.  wish it would stay up and on the window.  but I am getting used to it and ended up mounting it on the dash with a pad.,3,1
The space for the lock botton is too small so im not able to lock it with it. However for the price you can't ask for more. It works anyway.,3,1
"the remote is a laughing stock. like why did you say it came with it & has a battery but its fake? haha guess not a big deal since its right next to me. but still the remote sounded cool. you know us americans like easy. i have a truck so the too heavy thing doesn't apply to me, or my lighter just isn't a flimbsy piece of crap. either way its good, but if you find something cheaper go for it.",3,1
"This luxry item is fully lined wth some kind of cloth, which prevented me from sticking my velcro firmly on it so as to secrure the nook safely to the cover. I had to scrape some part of of the cloth away to make a custom secure lock on it, since this cover is indeed no more than it is, just a cover without the merest of e.g. magnetic lock on it.",3,1
did not need these,3,1
"Before I bought this product, I e-mailed the seller because it wasn't too clear under the product details or the reviews what type of device this case was for. I wanted to buy it for my iPod Touch 4th Generation but some of the reviews said it didn't fit, or it was for iPhones. I wanted to make sure this would definitely fit my iPod.  It does fit but can still pop/slip off the corners very easily.  I would like this case better if it were hard and not rubber.",3,2
It did fit my device so i appreciated that within itself I've been tryin to get ahold to a charger to my nook for like 6 months bit it was not very durable it broke in less than a week,3,2
"i like it but they say its similar to the ipod nano...no true only thing similar is the looks, everything else good be a little better but works as far as being able to download and listen to music on it",3,1

"I got the blue cover and it's actually iridescent peacock and quite lovely. It's light and not too bulky and seems to protect the phone well enough. The one thing I have noticed is that when I put it in my purse, with all the jostling that goes on in there, I often pull out a caseless phone. It's a two piece shell, and while it's easy to put on, it doesn't seem to latch that well.  The slightest tug on either end and the thing is off---which makes me worry that, should my phone take a decent spill, would the case stay on during impact?<br /><br />Still, so far it appears to be a good product for the price; I haven't had it for very long, so we'll see what happens!",3,1
"I wasn't blown away by these speakers.  The sound is fine - about what I would expect.<br /><br />The wires aren't long enough to separate the speakers and get a true stereo sound.  It would be nice to have ability to just plug them in to an AC socket, but they don't come with the USB/AC adapter.",3,1
"I was so excited to get this cover for my new kindle. I opened it up and could tell there was a distinct smell. I figured after it was out of the package it could \\""breath\\"" so to say to get the smell out. I put the kindle in the cover and just couldnt get that smell out of my nose. I took my kindle out and my kindle held the smell. I have wiped it down both the kindle and cover and the smell doesnt go away.   I love the cover, but I just cant get over the smell.   So if you arent sensitive to a strong, sharp smell, this item is for you! The overall product is great. Wish it didnt have such a bad smell.",3,1
"This is the 2nd laser parking devise I purchased.  The first one, one of the laser light dropped to half brilliance and was difficult to see where the spot was. I purchased a new one because I like the concept. I gave it a 3 star rating because of the first one failed right after the 90 days warranty. I have this one for about a month now and it still works as advertised. I will re visit this review at a later date and will upgrade the stars rating if it is still functioning properly.",3,2
"Was looking forward to these headphones for a long time! I did some searching and decided that these were the most bang for my buck. Unfortunately, I put them on and they slipped right off when I moved my head back and forth. A shame. I should have known, since I have small ears.<br /><br />So if you have small ears as well, don't think that these probably great headphones will magically conform to them.<br /><br />I'm sure they're great quality though.",3,1
Good,3,1
"This mount works great for holding my iPhone.  No worries about it falling out.  However I have handle bar extensions on my Honda ST1300 and the bars are odd sized.  This is more an application issue than a product issue.  I don't know if anything will hold well, so I bought this thinking the \\""grabby\\"" strap would work for me.  Not so much, but again, I have odd handle bars.  It does get hard to pull the strap hard enough to get it sticking in place without feeling like I'll break it.",3,1
This case is plastic and just a little protection for my new Garmin Nuvi- Nothing fancy but better than no protection at all!!  It fits in the case perfect.,3,1
"My biggest problem with these little guys is that when I turn them off then back on they come one at track 1.   Seems to me the program in my car CD that lets me turn the car off, run into the store and come back and when i crank on the car the CD player picks up where it left off....   If these little player did that then I'd even spring for the Ipod.  What a great feature none of these have.  My VL-532 came right from Asia in it's little brown envelope with the customs sticker on it as so many products do these days.  What I like about the features is that I can put it down for a couple of months and pick it up and figure it out without having to reread the instruction manuel.  They are all a bit different but you can't break it by trying out different buttons and soon I'm listen to Hawkins brief history of time, the brandenburg concertos, etc...   For random music I download stuff I like to listen over and over to so 512Mb is fine for my usage.  That will hold several books and many songs....  If I need a change, the process of deleting and adding other is just drag and drop.  Battery life is better than I need (for me) and if it did have a sleep timer it would be better but it don't.  Screen is easy to read.... one thing important you have to remmeber is weather or not it charges from the USB port with the power switch on or off...  Some are one way, some the other so take note, if not the learning curve is quick :-)    Nice little DMV format video took months to find because the download was NOT on the CD but eventually the VideoLan web site had a good link.   OLED screen is great as it can be for a sub one inch diaganol.  With a nice set of headphones enjoy the low cost and decent reliability.  Let me know if you think diffent or better still got a better throw away MP3 player.

"The driver software included with this GPS reciever is unstable when using Windows 7. I tried both the version on the cd-rom that came with the unit and the newer version downloaded directly from the manufacturers web site. Since the GPS data stream is serial data, the driver software is suppose to create a virtual comm port. It does that justy fine. EXCEPT GPS data is suppose to stream at 4800 baud rate. That's the industry standard. The driver ALWAYS defaults to 9600. That means you have to manually reset the baud rate to 4800 before the GPS receiver can communicate with whatever navigation software you're using. And everytime you restart your computer the baud rate gets reset back to 9600. So you must manually reset the rate each time you turn on the computer.     The manufacturer's forum has PAGES of customer input about having trouble using this GPS with Windows 7, but virtually nothing about problems with XP or Vista. So I suspect that the unit and driver work fine with those versions of Windows. Too bad I didn't check the forum until I was having trouble.     I'm not panning the receiver completely because once you do get the baud rate issues taken care of, the unit is as accurate and fast as any other GPS I've used.",3,1
"Pros:<br />10 ft. cable<br />charges, and syncs well... and well  that's really all you could want out of it... almost.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The 30 pin connector end fits fairly loosely into a iPhone or iPad port. Usually it will be fine but depending on how you hold the device even the weight of the cable can be enough to pull it out.<br />On occasion I have simply set the device down and not noticed that the cable pulled out just enough to interrupt the charge.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />Glad I bought this?  YES<br />Recommend to others? Mostly yes, that one issue has been a bit of a headache and since you really need a cable to do only 3 things (charge, sync, and stay plugged in) I have to take 2 stars off this one.<br /><br />Now that Lightning is the new way apple will be doing its cables I might just get an adapter and tape it on the end of this cable... then it'll work great!  =P<br /><br />Item's I've used this with:<br />iPod Touch (1st Gen)<br />iPhone 4S<br />iPad (original)",3,1

This is not what I expected.  I thought this portable speaker was to attach the ipod only.  I learned the hard way that the speaker also had to be attached to the Laptop at all times.,3,2
"The speaker pairs quickly enough though a little slower than a Logitech device I have.  Volume is good from the stereo transducers, but the problem is the device drops out considerably more often than other Bluetooth devices I have.  And the outdoor, clear field distance is approximately 10 feet at best.  Even occasionally with an iPad at 2 feet, the device drops out for small fractions of a second.  Very annoying.<br />**Update**<br />Customer Service has quickly  contacted me explaining my unit performance is unusual and is sending a replacement unit.  I will test both units carefully and update my feedback based on my findings.",3,1
Worked real good for awhile then will not charge.,3,2
"This cover is very good value for the money.  It fits nicely. I especially like the feature of the clasp holding open the cover for easier holding.  I deduct one star for the skin - the cover totally covers the Nook so that it cannot be seen. I did not bother putting mine on. This style of cover doesn't need a skin. Without bundling the skin with the cover, the price should be lower. Also, I deduct one star for the possibility that the Nook could slip out of the top.  I am not concerned for myself because the fit is so tight, and I don't plan to take the Nook out of the cover.  However, for those of you who might want to take your Nooks in and out of the cover to look at your skin, you could stretch the fit so the Nook could slide out to the top.",3,1
"Well, I knew what I was getting into when I bought this cable.  I obviously was not expecting top notch quality for the price I paid.  Let's just say, the cord worked fine for 3 days.  The end piece that connects to the iPhone completely tore off, exposing the wire underneath.  Needless to say, I had to throw it away.",3,2
"Its a great length, works fine to me, I ordered a 3m cord but received a 2m cord. but overall it works good for me. if you need a simple charger with good length i suggest.",3,1
"They are decent, inexpensive walkie-talkies. They worked fine on a long road trip between two vehicles - much easier than using our cell phones to talk. We also used them to contact each other at a large resort complex - grandmom does not have a cell phone, but she could use a walkie-talkie to contact us if she was alone and needed something,  She could be in a hotel room and contact us down on the beach very easily.<br />Drawbacks - our &#34;range&#34; was maybe a mile, but we were traveling in very built-up areas. Apparently, buildings can block reception. But we didn't need more than a mile so that was OK. The batteries run down pretty fast - but we could use them for a couple of days before the signal got weak or the low battery &#34;beep&#34; kicked in. We kept them on all the time, so of course that ran the batteries down - but we had to keep them on for grandmom to use.<br />Overall - I am glad I bought them. My kids and their buddies use them now around the house and in the yard for fun.",3,1
"This device doesn't have much loudness (volume) to it. Also, if you plug in to a USB cord to use for power, like a car cig lighter outlet, the AUX in from an iPod won't work, so you have to use AAA batteries when using an iPod.",3,2
Item had was not big enough to hole the window clip and was just big enough to gild gps and charger cable,3,2
"Speakers came without original box, the manual was photocopied. Instalation instructions were confusing. Cord going from speakers to Tv was wery short only 18 inches. Hardly enough to reach my tv from the stand. I purchased these speakers because my Father had bought them, not from Ace depot tho. His came in an original box with a longer cord and a better instruction manual. There was no other warranty card or such either. I feel these speakers were either a display or a return. The only consulation is that they work, after I purchased a longer cord.",3,2
The charger and cable are kind of lower quality then I had expected.  Sometimes I have to plug and unplug the adapter end into the phone several times before it starts working.,3,1
Good. I like the product. Good charger. Good trailer. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. !!,3,1

I use this on my boat so far so good im interested to see how it hold up to salt water.,3,1
"The only reason why I bought this case was because it was cheap and it was green. My favorite color is green, so I must get matching items for everything I buy. But sometimes things don't always come in green. This product doesn't fit snugg to the 3rd gen iPod touch very well. I just liked the color.",3,1

"The various little bluetooth  speakers are one of the greatest things to come down the pike in quite some while as far as Grandma is concerned.  I love to take one out on the porch while I read and watch the traffic go by.  Even better, they are great for camping & travel.  A mini-speaker and a movie on the iPad kept my granddaughter and I entertained one very stormy night in a tent.<br /><br />I love the look of the [[ASIN:B00J0CYKEQ Omaker M1 Ultra Portable Metallic Mini Wireless Bluetooth Speaker]].  It is quick and easy to charge and easy to operate.  It is, however, perhaps the most basic mini-speaker of the many that I've evaluated.  You'll find no place here to plug the speaker directly into your device using an audio cable, nor will you find a slot for a mini-SD card, which enables you to take an entire library of music with you without being device dependent.<br /><br />Most irritatingly, however, there is ▶︎ NO VOLUME CONTROL.  None.  Nada.  Zip.  The speaker does have a decent range - I took it about 40 feet from the device it was paired with - but when I realized that the volume wasn't high enough to overcome the traffic noise I had to get up and come all the way back to my cell phone to increase the volume there instead!  (This is absolutely not the norm.)<br /><br />Grandma's $0.02 - I don't see the point in a separate, ultra-bare bones speaker if I have to carry around the device it is paired with anyway.  Great color, not the top of my list.",3,1

"For the most part, this product works ok. Most of the time, it has a strong enough signal to transmit to FM frequency.. On occasion, it seems to have a loud pitch noise and does not transmit, no matter what FM frequency I try to sync it to.

Though my first experience with them did not pan out well, they've earned my respect and I would do business with them again.",3,2
"the product for the most part gets the job done but has major flaws. It looks durable, however; the plastic screen protector is difficult to apply. My nano screen has large air bubbles.

"After I placed the order I realized it was coming from China, so it took awhile to get here.<br />Nice design, good fit but it doesn't have any kind of impact protection. My son drop his while he had the new cover on and broke his iTouch.<br />I wouldn't order it again.",3,1

In other brand protector applications on other devices I was able to use the dust tape or Scotch tape to pick up a corner cleanly and remove the dust.

It is pretty awesome, honestly -- but there are two major problems with this sucker that keep me from giving it a glowing review.    1) The release button on the back, which opens the arms (releasing the phone) *sticks*. And it's pretty hard to get that button dislodged. Thus, if you have to remove the phone in the middle of the ride, it's sometimes impossible to get it back in the holster without going at the stuck button with a screwdriver.     2) As others have said, the strap that's used to secure this to the bike handlebars is about an inch too short to get good leverage when you're pulling it taut. Once it *is* locked in, it usually stays put -- but getting it there can be tricky.    Other than these two things -- one of which is due to shoddy construction, and the other to poor engineering -- I do like this, and the price is good, too. Just be prepared to lever out the button, and be prepared to maneuver the strap onto your bike!",3,1
"I just received this case today! It was packaged nicely, no damage, nothing wrong. My Kindle Paperwhite fits nice and snug! I first ordered a purple case for it before I received my Kindle (I pre-ordered) and the fit was very loose, and the auto sleep on it would turn it off when I flipped the cover back. This case does not do that! I am very happy. Why I am giving only 3 stars is because it took so long to get here! I live in Maryland and the return address said it came from Delaware, it took 2 and a half weeks to get here. I emailed the company and never heard back from them. I don't know why it took so long and it pissed me off. I don't think I will ordered from this guy again but it is a nice case, I have been waiting for someone to make a cute case for the Kindle Paperwhite, it just sucks how poor the shipping service was! Even with Christmas upon us, I ordered this 2 and a half weeks ago and came from one state over, it shouldn't have taken that long!!!!",3,2
Replacing the screen was not easy and trying to get it to set back in case it broke again! At least it helped get my son through until he got his iphone,3,2
"It's not a bad product, but you have to have the patience to do it correctly. It came with three protectors for the front and I went through all three and still had bubbles. For a few dollars more, I went to the store and purchase one and the guy at the store put it on for me. But if you are patient and follow the advice (i.e. have the shower running, use scotch tape, etc.) you can make this work for you.",3,1
It looks and feels good. But it sounds like a little tranzister radio.  I wouldn't buy this again if it breaks.,3,1
"I love having one headlight that can do red and white light, and both a narrow and wide beam in white, and all of the settings are bright enough for me.  Howevever, to move between the different settings you have to repeatedly click on a push switch which is very stiff.  What would be ideal for me would be a slider switch that you move back and forth between the different settings, or four separate push switches. <br /> <br />My only other complaint is that the light can shine in your eyes if you wear it too low on your forehead. <br /> <br />As someone else noted, the pictured item is another headlight from Energizer, not the 6-led version.",3,1

"Although it isn't the highest quality, I only need it to playback old tapes. I plugged it into my power conditioner, and the tape hiss was much less than expected. I recorded two tapes from a 1981 recording session, and the quality was fine. The mic is a joke, but I won't ever record to cassette anyway.",3,1
Not real leather but it is sturdy and fits the nook simple touch perfectly. Good product for the price. I recommend it,3,1
I put this on and it does not have nearly as much reflection as in the pictures.  The protector is also a little bit scratchy.  But if you are wanting to walk around with a mirror this is something you should get.,3,1
The case falls off really easily. I only used it temporarily before I got one that actually stays on.,3,2
This particular case for the zen vision M is excellent. I ave had my Zen vision M for well over a year and have triede many cases. Of those cases this one was deffinetly one of my top 2. There are 2 drawbacks that I can think of. Only one is a major flaw the other isn't. First due to the material it uses it attracts dust andlent like a magnet. Second the plastic cover will easily come off of the case if you bump into someone. You may notice that it fell but it is a clear screen cover goodluck in finding it. Other than those to things it is a great product.,3,1
Good,3,1
If you are looking to increase the sound in your stock stereo without adding the &#34;Ghetto bass&#34; this is the right amp for you!<br />Is loud enough to over come any conversation inside the vehicle - but not laud enough to be noticed by outside pedestrians!,3,1

I guess this MP3/4 player shouldn't be this expensive but i just received it all of thirty minutes ago.  the sounds good came in earlier than expected camera is a little pixelish but you cant expect a great quality camera on something this generic all and all im satisfied with it considering its some what of a step up  from my last player . Just wanna say thanks to my studsband for buying this for me. me,3,1
"I have a Logitech s715i dock (http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Portable-30-Pin-iPhone-Speaker/dp/B003VANOI6), which is a fairly popular device. The auris works, but what they don't tell you is that it will only work when it is plugged in, presumably due to the level of power which it needs to draw. This is probably not an issue with higher end docks (though I highly recommend the s715i for the price) as they probably don't even work without being plugged in, but one of the perks of my dock was that it was portable.<br /><br />Other than that, it was simple enough to set up and use, and the sound seems to be of similar quality to using an Airport Express.",3,1

"The holder attached to the windshield extremely secure. But once you have placed the HTC in the holder, if you want to move to another screen.  Due to how the bottom brackets are made the Flyer will slip out.  They should have made the brackets like a J shape hook and not a L shape to hold the Flyer in place better, so when it slips while driving the J shape hook will catch it and it won't fall out, like it has a few times already, due to the fact that it is a bit heavier than any GPS, of which I use my HTC Flyer for also when I'm on the road. Other then that its a good buy.",3,1

its not a 1000 watt sub folks its a 500 so fyi now dont get me wrong a audiobahn 15 for 59 bucks is a steal being its one of the first if had many many audiobahn subs never once had someone not like it instantly 3 stars simply because the advertisement is not right,3,2
"First of all let me say that I had a great experience buying the product and then subsequently returning it.<br />The product itself however, leaves a lot to be desired.  It is very basic and does not come close to my $30 iPhone app for ease of use and clarity of the screen.  I used it twice, then returned it (thank goodness for that &#34;60 day&#34; policy).<br />Pros: small, rugged and comfortable to carry/wear, accuracy was also very good.<br />Cons: not great clarity on the screen, esp. in bright sunlight.  Moving around the &#34;bullseye&#34; on the screen to gauge distances was also cumbersome, as I said, it is much better on my iPhone.<br />I will continue to use my app and not spend the money on a dedicated GPS, at least until they come way down in price.",3,2
"Does what it advertises...only thing that was annoying was the remote stopped working after 2 days...as my title says, what do you expect for $6?

"I love Alpine products I have had 4 head units in various cars over the years.  I was excited to get this HD tuner because several stations in the area offer HD broadcasts.  The great thing about the HD is that you usually get to see the artists name, the song title and the album on the display as it is playing.  I like this feature because if I like what I hear then I can make a note of it for future reference.  Not all stations offer this feature unfortunately.    The problem with my unit is that it worked for several weeks but then it stopped updating the songs.  When I turn it on it will give me the current song but when the song changes the first song played stays on the display.  So I called Alpine and the were very helpful.  The problem it seems is that my head unit is several years old and the HD tuner is new.  The head unit needs an update.  So according to the person I spoke with I have to pull my head unit and ship it back to Alpine.  The will update the software and return it to me for free.  All well and good however they are on the west coast and I am on the east coast.  It is a 5 day ship time each way and they will take 2-3 days to do the update.  So I am looking at, best case, being with out my head unit (no music or podcasts) for two weeks minimum.  It really is not worth all that to me and is kind of disappointing.    What I do not understand is why, with technology today, I cannot download the update myself on my computer and then install it in my head unit (it has a USB connection).  Time to update guys!",3,2
Great I love it but when I took it off it broke so I'm sad about that 😕 thank you,3,1
The product didn't come with an applicator or anything to apply it with.  It allows too many bubbles.  Would've been better,3,1
"I didn't expect much from this speaker, but it surprise me. The volume was loud, the lights look cool, but after a few uses there is so many con.

Yep..,3,1
"The unit works half the time. I have changed the batteries and relocated it. I have also changed the sensitivity of the transmitter,but it still works half the time.",3,1
"The power on this is great. But it is really a pain that you have to have a cord with two USB ends to power it. That comes with the battery, but if you misplace it, you can't just use something else.  Other batteries come with other ports to be able to recharge the battery, so I don't need to carry a special cord for it.  It is also a little heavier than I like.<br /><br />I kept it because it is powerful and really charges the devices well. It is good to have in the house in case we lose power ( which we tend to ). I wouldn't use it in a backpack or purse. It is a little too heavy for that and there are other lighter weight options.",3,1
Not too sure about the product because the ear part broke but knowing that my daughter is a little hard on things she could have done it but I know it's a great price and would order again but more than one!,3,1
"works well, but small storage space",3,1
"Crisper sound than some of the others in the same price catagory, not quite as full on the base like the Alaska Bear but has more clarity.  Very nice weight, and durability. I don't like the cheesy verbage telling you its connected, or powering up. Better to have simple tones",3,1

"Works up to about 20-30 feet away from receivors with all brand new batteries.  Beeps can be heard much further than the 20-30 foot working distance.  Good for finding an item if you are in the same room or just outside the room door.  Construction seems reasonably sturdy.  Will see how long it lasts with wear and tear.  Built in light useful up to a few feet at most.  Handy for inserting a key,  Not much else.",3,1
the dome lights don't work with the doors. the earphones are hack quality. the remote is a sham aka doesn't work. the games are trash and the bottom of the screen is starting to separate. I wouldn't buy it again and when i watch movies from the head unit on to the flip down the pictures rolls.,3,2
It works like it says it does but the playback on a larger screen is very blurred - you really cannot read any license plates in front of you. I have tried all the settings - even on its highest settings it is low screen size or resolution and you cannot zoom in on playback on the unit itself.,3,2

"installed on my Kawasaki Vulcan 1500 mainly to have something for my ipod to hook up to. the radio portion is okay for picking up local and some distance radio stations but even following the directions it was impossible to set the clock or tune the individual radio buttons to select radio stations. for the cheap of a price radio it's okay just be gentle with it and don't turn the volume too high, I don't think they would hold up to long at that rate.",3,2
I liked it and it works on the NY city overhead trains.,3,1
get a lot of static in certain areas,3,1
No works in my Mazda CX-5 :(  but works in Zeppelin audio system,3,1
This case is very cheaply made. It feels like I will have to get a replacement in a few months. Especially the kickstand. It will obviously break VERY soon.     The only thing that was satisfactory was its variety of colors. It will be fun while it lasts.,3,1
It's a stylish case and it's protective but the first time I dropped it the corner of it is white because I dropped it and it dosent look good because of that and when you drop it it falls apart over all it's a good case for the price but needs tiny improvements,3,1
"This product was exactly what I was wanting,but didn't work with my devices.  Not sure if that was because of the product itself or my devices just weren't compatible - Altech Lansing radio/speaker/ipad/iphone player and 7th generation nano ipod.  Oh well - it was worth the try.",3,2
"Purchased this product to help prevent insurance scams of supposed auto accidents and any other mishaps. The size of the rear view mirror itself is a little longer in width than expected depriving me of putting up my sunshade with ease. The clips that mount to the original vehicle rear view mirror needs to be worked on, especially for vehicles who's mirrors are curved on the back. The clips themselves for the top have rubber feet? while the bottom is plastic, which mounts onto the OEM mirror loosely. Any shake or rattle will involuntary adjust the viewing angle for the mirror and cameras itself.<br /><br />The front camera is easily adjustable as is the inside facing camera. The inside camera that has IR sensors to assist in shooting either still pictures or videos, is worthless. It doesn't help the inside camera enough to help distinguish objects, just plain darkness or shapes that are barely visible. The rear facing camera is useless for shooting at night as it is only able to pick up any available lighting such as headlights. Ill be switching this camera out for a different camera that uses better IR sensors.<br /><br />Inputs are easily pointed out with openings for power, rear camera, usb port, and an a/v output that you can use to connect to a different monitor or a dvd player. The description of the camera says that you can do side by side images, this is performed by switching the selector switch to the third setting. PIP gets annoying. After you set the camera up to your liking in the settings option, everytime the camera is powered on, depending what choice you choose to go with, either I, II, or III, youll still end up having a PIP. Also the rear facing camera records video as a reflection and not as a mirror image. No option to fix that. Lastly, A LOT of noise can be heard when playing back the video for review. All in all, for the price it does what it's supposed to do. I'd have gladly paid a little more if the smaller features worked as intended. I'lladd any addendums to this review if I find anything else.",3,2
The wire lose so fast after I use the charger on few days this is the only thing is not good on this charger,3,1

I was expecting the remote to affect non-DVD videos.  I probably didn't do the proper research first.  It does well what it was designed to do.,3,1
Prompt delivery and good packaging.  But it seems to play one along for about 54:40 minutes of my 60 minute meditation disc and then hangs up every time.  I checked the disc in another player and it plays completely through every time.  I found the the ear buds very comfortable but the Walkman eats batteries.  It's okay for what it is but I would probably pay more money for my next player.,3,1

"As a buyer of well-over 300 Baofeng radios (and counting) for the group I belong to (not all of which were purchased through Amazon but many were), I'm always amazed at the lengths some sellers go to to hype their products as being \\""newer\\"" or \\""better\\"" than other models, or perhaps (to give them the benefit of the doubt) they just don't know any better.<br /><br />First, the Baofeng UV-5R series (including the original and still extremely popular UV-5R, I'll explain why in a minute) is what is normally referred to by many as a SDR radio (or software defined radio).  While not a true SDR product (you can't use it with your computer to control the radio's functions or scan a wide amount of VHF/UHF frequencies with it), none the less a large chip is programmed on the circuit board built inside each radio.  That chip determines what capability the radio itself can perform.<br /><br />Every UV-5R series radio has the ability to transmit from 136-174 MHz on VHF and from 400-520 MHz on UHF in both narrow-band and wide-band modes (very useful for the occasional FRS or MURS use, which requires narrow-band mode to work correctly).<br /><br />Every model does \\""at least\\"" 4W on VHF/UHF from the factory, but occasionally you'll get a batch that does 4.5W or even 5W out, but the difference between 4W and 5W is minimal at best.  A 4W radio with a better antenna will easily outperform a 5W radio with the standard crappy antenna that Baofeng ships on ALL (including the UV-5RA, -5RA+, -5RAX, and -5RAX+) models.<br /><br />Baofeng DOES NOT program those chips any differently for the UV-5R vs. any other UV-5R series (including the UV-5RA+).  Version 307 of the firmware (which is the most current release I have in any of my radios) works EXACTLY the same way as previous older releases of firmware at least back to the 295 release (over a year ago), so any claim from a seller that this release provides additional features (at least from a user's perspective) is simply BOGUS, since the firmware inside both radios have the same features.  In fact, my UV-5R radios with the 307 firmware release is EXACTLY the same radio (inside and within the firmware) as my UV-5RA+ radios with the 307 firmware release.<br /><br />Second, you CANNOT in any way upgrade the firmware (unless you count buying a different radio and it comes with a different firmware release), so again the claim in the listing (from some sellers) that you can is simply BOGUS.<br /><br />Third, you can believe that two thinner pieces (glued or screwed together on the faceplate of the UV-5RA+) is somehow stronger than one thicker piece of plastic (on the original UV-5R series) if you like (and maybe it is), but I haven't seen that in real-world use from my own UV-5RA+ units.  The standard UV-5R units that we use seem to hold up just as well (when dropped in the desert dirt or rolling down a hill) as any other Baofeng radio we own and use.<br /><br />Fourth, and my biggest issue with all of the non-standard UV-5RA, UV-5RA+, UV-5RAX and UV-5RAX+ units, is that NONE of the Baofeng battery accessories (except the little 1800 mAh standard battery) work WITHOUT modification (unless you use a Dremel tool to grind or cut off part of your extended battery that works on the standard UV-5R - but won't work on your UV-5RA, UV-5RA+, UV-5RAX or UV-5RAX+).<br /><br />Getting new UV-5RA+ units that don't work with Extended 3800 mAh batteries (without modification) doesn't make my group happy.  That may not bother you, but NONE of the sellers of the non-standard UV-5RA, UV-5RA+, UV-5RAX, and UV-5RAX+ units ever seem to mention that lack of hardware compatibility in their listings, so buyer beware!<br /><br />BTW, NONE of the \\""AA\\"" or \\""AAA\\"" battery shell packs work on the UV-5RA, UV-5RA+, UV-5RAX, or UV-5RAX+ units either, so that's 3 different battery accessories (including the 3800 mAh extended battery) that you can't use on these radios without hacking them with a Dremel tool (but they all work without modification on the original UV-5R units).<br /><br />So \\""if\\"" you want a \\""pretty\\"" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (-5RA+, -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.  Oh, you should see how well that shiny faceplate lights up when a flashlight hits it in the dark, just the thing you don't want for night use.<br /><br />Virtually every guy in our group ends up carrying a standard UV-5R and giving the UV-5RA, -5RA+, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ to the wife or kids, since the wife and/or kids rarely care about the other accessories working and they (the wife and kids) tend to like the \\""pretty\\"" radios, but again there is NO INTERNAL difference and NO EXTRA FEATURES in the UV-5RA, -5RA+, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ units (other than a different looking shiny faceplate) vs. the original and still wildly popular UV-5R (which I refer to as the M16 of radios, as all the accessories you match it up with just plain work).<br /><br />Now you know the real background on these radios.ion on the original UV-5R units).<br /><br />So \\""if\\"" you want a \\""pretty\\"" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (-5RA+, -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.

"Well I ordered this cause my boyfriend has a similar one like it and unfortuately the angle that my cigarette lighter is in my car it won't stay in but other then that it worked. oh If you're buying this cause it has the controller, don't because the controller is fake.

"This would have been an ideal semi-permanent tablet mount, but it has a problem. The attachment to the seat is excellent, and the bottom part of the mount is very secure. However, the shaft is too flexible, and when you have the weight of the tablet at the top, it moves around so much (when the car is moving), it is unuseable. I tried to secure the top part of the mount by squeezing it between the passenger seat and the center console, but even this did not work very well. The tablet mount itself is exceptional, and if it was screwed into the console or dash it would be a perfect mount. But the gooseneck arrangement is a no-go.",3,1
"I wanted something to protect the ipod, but this really doesn't do the trick.  The silicon case is very flimsy because it is only on the outter edge.  The buttons aren't as easy to press (I turned mine off accidentally, when I'm running - that's a pain!).  Also - the case inteferes with the clip, which I don't like.  I clip the ipod to my lanyard at work, but I can't do that with the silicon case on (well, I have a hard time doing it and the ipod has fallen off a couple of times...).  I find myself not using the case much at all.  I should have listened to the negative reviews. Glad I didn't spend much.",3,2
"It is a decent sounding bass for someone just wanting a little extra kick in their stock stereo system.  The quick connect on my box was put together poorly and caused a short between the Power and Ground wires.  I had to take this apart and put different ends on the cables to be more safe.  While inside the box I noticed several spots that were not caulked well and there were no braces at all.  The little amp is only like a 4 inch square and a little underpowered for the speaker. The RCA cables are not terminated so you will have to go but RCA cables if you are hooking this up to an aftermarket stereo.  Also, the blue remote wire is very short and you will have to get more of that as well. But for $98 and a little work you can make this thing sound ok inside your car.",3,1

"[[VIDEOID:mo1YP5E8S67URC0]]A little intro to the video:<br />This is just a 1 minute clip of me driving...not doing anything special, but just trying to show the quality of the video. The quality is set at 1080p Full HD, with the recommended settings by the manufacturer. When you are set at 1080p the camcorder CANNOT shoot with the 120 degree lens. I do have another video shot at 720p (w/the 120 degree view), but I decided to post the highest resolution video I have....(look for P71Interceptor87's videos on youtube). Overall, I believe the quality of this camera is amazing. Everything is so vivid, and you can finally read license plates! If you would like the full review, read below....<br /><br />Just purchased this camcorder yesterday, and overall I am extremely pleased. I do not know why many are rating this so low. It does not mention anywhere that it comes with a Micro SD card so why are people rating it less because it is not included?<br /><br />Memory Card:<br />Anyway, for this I purchased the Amazon Basics 16GB Micro SD Class 10. It seems to work very well..so far I have about 30-40 min of HD footage and it still has about 12.1GB left over. Not too bad..and if there is ever a moment that you want saved and not overwritten you just hit a button on the top of the DOD GS600 and it saves the last few clips. One downside that I did notice that many others mentioned is the delay between clips. Even with a class 10 I've noticed about 1-2 second delay using 1 minute intervals. So far it really doesn't concern me, but if I ever miss something that happened really fast I'm sure I'll be disappointed...that being said, you may wish to choose a different memory card that will not cause a delay (as some reviewers have said). I believe people have mentioned the Patriot and Lexar as doing well (both must be class 10).<br /><br />Changing settings:<br />Another concern that people have brought up is changing the settings of the GS600, which is alittle bit of a pain. However, the GS600 does come with many hook-ups. It has an HDMI cable, cigarette lighter cable, RCA cables (for TV) and a USB cable. If you have an HD TV with an HDMI hookup then take your GS600 and connect it to the TV via HDMI. Then, plug the GS600 into some USB device that will charge it (I used my laptop). Then simply go to your HDMI screen on your TV and use the included remote to shift through the settings. If you do not have a TV with HDMI, it may be alittle more difficult. Chances are, you will need to have the GS600 plugged into the cigarette lighter of your car, and then have a TV close by for you to plug the RCA cables into. This can be a chore, but after one or two setting adjustments you should never have to repeat those steps again. Once you get to the settings menu you can change the language, set the time and date, change the GPS reading from kph to mph and change the resolution, amongst many other things. One thing I found weird is that you can actually change the GS600 to shoot in black and white, sepia, negative and even \\""art.\\"" Very strange settings to have for a car black box, but none the less an interesting feature...<br /><br />Installation:<br />Installing the GS600 into the car is a relatively easy process. All you need to do is connect the GS600 to the suction cup mount and then remove the little adhesive to the suction cup and place it on the windshield any place that you would like. For the video, I placed mine it the upper center of my windshield. It is actually right behind the rearview mirror, and I can barely see it while driving, which is really nice. Also, since the GS600 is black, it tends to blend in very well with the black from the mirror, so you can barely see this thing from the outside of my car. A very nice thing to have since you don't want anyone seeing this thing and attempting to break into your car and stealing it! Once more, it provides a very good view of the windshield (the view is actually much better when you shoot in 720p for the 120 degree view...you can see my entire front hood, which is pretty huge on the crown vics..) at the center, so I would highly recommend placing it there...After you have the actual GS600 placed you will need to run the power to it. Many just simply connect it to the GS600 and have the cord hanging down to the cigarette plug. However, they give you a very very long cord for a reason!!! There will be pictures up of me routing the wire so it is not so intrusive so be sure to check them out! All I did was had the wire go up and clamp it to the top of my car using the driver's side visor, and then hiding the cord into the weather stripping all the way down the door jam. Then, once its at the carpet, rip the carpet up and run the cord under where your feet would be (around the pedals)and have it come out right where your cigarette plug is. There is plenty of enough cable to do this, and it makes it look much nicer than having such an obvious cord dangling down all the time...<br /><br />Recording:<br />Pretty simple! When the car is on, the GS600 will immediately begin to record. This is the case for most vehicles..unfortunately for me, even when the car is off it will still give a charge, and therefore the GS600 will just stay on forever if plugged in (and will, inevitably, drain my car battery). Therefore, I need to plug and unplug mine everytime I want to use it. Its a bit of a chore, but its about a 2 second process so I think I'll live. Just make sure to check how your car functions so you do not drain your battery!<br /><br />Overall, I love this camcorder.. The footage is amazing, the audio is very good, the GPS seems to work great, and it has all the features one needs to easily record their driving excursions. This has to be one of the best black box cams there is. We'll see how it goes after a few weeks and months....<br /><br />UPDATE 1: Just browsed through the manual today and came across some very helpful info that I thought I would share..First off, before purchasing this unit I was curious how well it would function after being out in my car during really hot or really cold weather. In the manual it mentions the unit can function in temperatures between -10C to 70C, which is about 14F-158F. Not too bad, though considering that winter is coming up and I live in Buffalo,NY....ahhh, we'll see. Another nice thing I found in the manual are estimates on how much video you can shoot, based on the size of your memory card and the resolution your shooting at.<br /><br />Here are the numbers (note that these are estimates made by the manufacturer):<br /><br />Using a 1GB Micro SD Card<br />1920x1080(30FPS) = 17min<br />1440x1080(30FPS) = 27min<br />1280x720 (30FPS) = 34min<br />848x480  60FPS) = 35min<br />640x480  30FPS) = 105min<br /><br />So, if you wanted to figure out how much an 8GB Micro SD would hold at 1920x1080, you would just multiply (17 x 8 = 136min or alittle over 2 hours of footage). Since I have decided to stay at 1280x720 for the 120 degree lens, that means my 16GB Micro SD can theoretically hold alittle over 9 hours of footage..plenty of enough, so glad I do not have to shell out more money for a 32GB or 64GB like I thought!<br /><br />UPDATE 2: Well, its been about a month and so far so good. Everytime I plug it in, it works. The delay is definitely still an annoyance to me..I actually purchased an Adata Class 10 and it made no difference on the 2-3 second delay. Another problem that I do have is that when I unplug the camera (upon arriving at my destination and turning off my car) that last clip is not saved. It does have a \\""file\\"" for it, but it tells you there is an error when you click on it. Also, if I had to be picky then I would have to add that the night vision isn't all that great..Still I would keep this at 5 stars. Its still a great dash cam that records very high quality videos. It just recently recorded a deer slamming into the side of my car on the highway!!!<br /><br />UPDATE 3 ***2Stars Deducted***: Well, my review just went down 2 stars after speaking with CameraTec customer service. After receiving a few comments on here regarding the issue I have with the corrupted file occurrences (read update 2) I had, I decided to contact CameraTec and this is what they told me..<br /><br />\\""This is a common problem with the current GS600, unfortunately it is a hardware problem and cannot be fixed with a firmware update. I do not know the technical side of things but I believe that after some wear that the internal battery shorts out or gets overloaded or something to that effect.

Basically, what I'm getting from this email is \\""Yup, we know its a problem, and its our hardware, all our fault..nope, we aren't doing anything about it, but why don't you try out the new version when it comes out??

"when I got these in it was actually in like an envelope. and a few were bent and I only had five in there. The two i tried didnt stick very well. I dont really think it necessary for it now, i just got them because they looked shiny",3,2
Served the purpose. But I found a better one that we both like better & it fit the hole much better.,3,1
A lot of wires going on and you have to position all the pieces the right way so you don't get intereference and the sound is clear.,3,1
"This went on easy and looked good for awhile, but started peeling on the edges in only a couple of weeks.  I might have put it on wrong as there were no instructions on how to apply.  Maybe a wipe down of the Nook with some alcohol before application would have made the adhesive stick better.",3,2
It does its job but the material the arm band is made of is kind of itchy and not that comfortable to use when working out especially when you start sweating. One good thing about it is the strap is really adjustable so it works for all arm sizes. The plastic does allow you do use your ipod without taking it out  though so that's nice.,3,1
"The case caught my eye because of the cool color. When it came in the mail (which was fast) I was a little disappointed when I saw and felt how thin it was. I was expecting a little more protection or cushion. If you want a \\""super slim\\"" case then this is a good option for you. But overall, I'm satisfied because it does the job and the 6 screen films are great.",3,1

"got this for the bathroom, so my wife can listen to her music while she's \\""getting ready\\"" for two hours.<br /><br />I was shocked by the power of this little guy.<br /><br />The only problem is it auto-shuts-down, so you have to pick it up to flick the switch on the bottom (ugh), and THEN sync it to your iphone, then put your phone back in the bedroom, then come back to the bathroom. It's a little too much trouble when the whole idea was to keep your phone OUT of a steamy damp bathroom. We wanted an easy \\""hit play and youre done\\"" solution.<br /><br />We ended up using the microSD card slot, and not her iphone or bluetooth at all, so now it's just \\""pick up, turn on, hit play\\"".<br /><br />Probably wouldn't buy it again. There were a lot of other options in the $25-$40 range, you might have better luck elsewhere.",3,2

"So far, the home kit looks fine. Except that Parts Express - the company that ships the item out on behalf of Amazon, sent me a kit that had a 12VDC adapter instead of the 110VAC one.

"I like everything about this unit except for the buttons. Our company bought several 2000c's and have had  problems with the buttons ceasing to work.

"This Kobo Touch eReader can work without any computer at all. You only need a wireless LAN. The software is not the best, but the hardware is quite good.<br /><br />Inspired by the reviews here, I have just bought one of these cute little toys. I've never had an e-reader, but I've heard and read many stories about how wonderful they are. So I finally bought one because the reviews here made me think that it would work with linux. After a few hours of frustrating failures, I did get it going.<br /><br />I will write some notes here about solutions to linux issues because it is not easy to find this information, here or elsewhere.<br /><br />I found it impossible to get the initial registration to work over a USB cable to a linux PC. The famous unsupported Kobo-desktop Debian package requires some software called \\""Alien\\"", which can be located on the web, but it converts the DEB file to an RPM file which is unusable because half a dozen library files are missing. Actually those files are more or less present, but they have to be of exactly the right version and sub-version, which is very unlikely when linux distributions are changing so quickly. So the unsupported kobo-desktop.deb file is of no use.<br /><br />Finally, after a few hours of failures, I thought that I would have to wind up the old Windows XP machine to register my new Kobo Touch, but this eReader gives you the option to register either via a computer or via a wireless LAN. The WLAN option works immediately without any difficulties! So you don't actually need a computer in the loop at all.<br /><br />To obtain better functionality, I downloaded and installed the binary version of the Calibre software, which seems to work very well. (The source package is plagued by library incompatibilities.) Calibre can't register the Kobo, but it is useful for managing it after registration. If you don't want to use any PC management software, you can write files directly to the reader's USB file system which pops up on your PC when you connect the cable. The Kobo magically finds the loaded files and indexes them after you disconnect the USB cable.<br /><br />If you don't need to load files to/from the Kobo from your computer at all, you can just get e-books from online stores if you wish. Then it doesn't matter if you've got linux, a Mac, an IBM mainframe or an Enigma machine for a computer.<br /><br />The expansion slot for a micro-SD card works fine. The screen is good for documents with small pages, but it is really unsuitable for A4 documents. It is pretty bad at panning over a page, and the various controls are difficult to operate. If you have an A4-format document with 10-point type, you can't easily view it on this Kobo, even in landscape mode. If you increase the magnification, you have to do much more panning, which is not convenient to do.<br /><br />E-books which are specially formatted for e-readers seem to be okay. But standard PDF files are not suited to it. I suppose I could convert PDF files to EPUB format using the Calibre software, but I've been waiting for 2 hours already for a single 1200-page PDF file to be converted to E-book format. This might be an overnight job.<br /><br />* PS. 2013-1-23. I have to lower my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars because this unit is probably going to be almost useless to me. I wanted it for viewing PDF files, but it seems to have major software design flaws. When viewing an A4 document, it cuts off the top 20% to 25% of the top of the page, with lesser percentages missing at the other three margins. So even though I can zoom in on text (with difficulty), I can't see anything outside the central zone of the page.<br /><br />My attempt to convert PDF files to EPUB using Calibre totally failed. All I get is garbled partial text with about 50% to 80% of the text randomly omitted, and very poorly formatted. (And it takes about 4 hours to convert 1200 pages.) Even with a properly prepared EPUB book (like the Calibre manual), the navigation is clumsy and annoying. The user interface overall is poorly designed.<br /><br />Even a professionally prepared sample e-book (published by Dover) about mathematics was not very readable. This e-reader is not really suitable for mathematics because of the need for diagrams and formulae. (Diagrams require a lot of screen space. Formulae require high resolution.) I might have to write my own software to convert PDF (or TeX) to EPUB. But it isn't worth the bother. I can use my (linux) notebook computer instead, which does everything perfectly and runs 6 hours on batteries.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Yes, this machine does work with linux. But my overall assessment remains the same. It is a \\""potentially useful toy\\"". I think I'll stick with real books and real computers.gation is clumsy and annoying.

This is of good construction and is solid however I had to modify it to allow me to work out with it on.  It is designed for someone that was an arm smaller than 15 inches.  I needed to add another piece of Velcro in order to be able to workout and not have my iPod fall off every time I bent my arm.  Again good quality but it is a one size fits most,3,1
"Stereo rocks very well, has plenty of power.   Plays all sorts of discs well.  Some things annoy me though. <br />1st)  won't switch from clock to text display when playing MP3 discs, only does track# to clock. <br />2nd) volume knob needs to be knurled or stick out more, hard to grip while driving <br />3rd)  joystick control is hard to use, very small if you have big fingers, and really hard to control while driving if you hit even the smallest road imperfection. <br />4th)  blue dot matrix display doesn't really match the rest of the unit, and display fades out completely if sunlight shines on it.",3,1

Love the case, not the screen protector. Thank god it was free.",3,1

"I got this for a cookout I had last week. It's nice and loud and filled up the entire backyard with a pretty clear sound. It got loud enough that people asked for it to be turned down after a good while. The plastic feels really flimsy though. The fake tape deck always feels like it's going to break the moment you open it. The accessories it comes with to hold Ipod Classics aren't the right size, which means that older ipods won't be held taught within the boombox. A lot of the decals look like they're about to lift off the plastic as well, which makes it look weathered, and fits the look I was looking for, but if you're looking for something pristine, you may want to hold off. The remote works great and the EQ makes up for what shortcomings that speakers have.<br /><br />It could be better, but it's not bad. Probably not worth 170 bucks though.",3,1
"Sound is too low. But for the price, its ok.",3,1
You get what you pay for.  The earbuds fall out easily and the cords for each ear are different lengths.  It was okay,3,1
"I bought this back in March so I've had some time to form an opinion.<br /><br />The good:<br />Decent low light performance.  Not awesome but much better than GoPro or Contour.<br />Small and light weight.<br /><br />The bad:<br />Terrible sound.  There's a warbling that's always there no matter what.<br />Poor battery life -- maybe 1.2-1.3 hours in practice.  I'd really like to see something with at least 4-5 hours of battery life.  More would be better.<br />Non-standard USB connector - can't buy generic cables.<br />No way to set the clock - files have useless date/time stamps.<br />Support takes several days to respond, if they respond at all.<br />Sometimes refuses to power on, even though it's been charging for hours.<br /><br />I'm not crazy about the sticky mount for a bicycle helmet.<br /><br />Overall, I'm disappointed with this camera.  Low cost wearable HD cameras that are good for low light conditions aren't quite here yet.  I'm considering the V.I.O. but it's a bit pricey.",3,2
I purchased this about a year ago and have installed it in my 2010 Ford Ranger. The alarm works great and I didn’t need the programming box most installers have. Now if you want the additional features to work then you will need to have it installed by an installer with a programming box. I didn’t feel the need to. It has been working great with no false trips. The problem I have is with the remote controllers. The first one cracked and broke where the upper and lower housing connect. I had to super glue the housing back together. Now the second one is doing the same thing. This is a defect in manufacturing of the remote housings. That is why I only gave it three stars.,3,1
I take 5 second hits and it goes down in 4% maybe every 2-1 minutes and a full charge will last maybe 30 minutes,3,1

"I bought the Kindle so I could bring it with me and have it read various ebooks to me while I'm out. This includes my 1 hour drive to work, my 8 hour shift and all the running around in between. I needed a good case to protect the Kindle since it's usually kept on me. I haven't dropped it but it has seen a number of bumps and scrapes since I usually keep it in my knee pocket on my cargo pants (It just fits). The case has some scuff marks but the Kindle is like new. The magnetic flaps work great. The make shift stand on the case works great but I don't use it much.    My only complaint is that after roughly 2 months of use, the straps that attach the sections are cracking. Seeing as it's leather I'm not sure if they will actually wear to the point that they will break anytime soon. But unlike the rest of the case which is pretty solid, these straps seem pretty weak and I'm not sure how longer they will last. Like the connection points on my old flip phone that I broke several times. I will note however, that I'm probably using the Kindle most that most people would. I'd still prefer it if the straps held up like the rest of the case.",3,1
"The best thing about this MP3 player is the price.  It's somewhat cheaply made, but what can you expect for $15?  My main gripe is that it appears that you can't scroll through the menu to make a selection by artist or album.  I've read through the user's guide and from what it says it looks like you have to scroll song by song to get to the one you want.  A real hassle if you have 500 songs on a 2gig SD card.  I've got a call out to Jwin's customer support to ask them about this issue.",3,1

"As a back up batterie is good,nice to have it charged at home and cary it with you,it will come verry usefull however,don't rely on as a solar power charger.I left it outside in my backyard \\""southern California\\"" for almost 3 days and that unit did not get enough power to charge the iPhone.",3,2
"PROS:<br />* Small and rich in features<br />* Good sound quality<br />* Good value for the price<br /><br />CONS:<br />* Sansa video converter is a joke. The Fuze will only take a very very specific video format. The converter software simply fail to convert videos to that format. On two other computers the software failed to identify the Fuze. I spend days trying to find ways to convert my videos to work on the Fuze.<br />* When rotating control gets dust behind it, it is difficult to rotate it. I need to use two fingers to manage to move it. I did not find a way to clean it.",3,2
"I have had several touch screen phones before and most of the screens for those phones used to scratch very quickly, this one seems to hold a bit more value. I have had it for over a month and no scratches yet.  The only thing I don't like about it is if you look at the phone at an angle, the screen appear to have an effect which I can describe only as an oily spot in the rain, funky colors and weird shapes",3,1
So good. It has been working nicely. I wish that the originals where more durable and I didn't have to replace them,3,1
"Have not installed yet seems to be OK, will know after installation. Thanks I will notify at a later date.",3,1
"I bought this product knowing to be pessimistic about the quality, and I was right. It's been a few months, and the stitching is falling apart, but still in usable condition. I give it two to three more months before it completely falls apart.<br />Pro: fit properly, ipod fit properly and was water tight<br />Cons: falling apart after a few months",3,2
Good Product for the cost.,3,1
Doesn't aways work correctly.  By plugging and unplugging will tend to work OK.,3,2
"Cute case, problem kept slipping off, and with puting it inside and taking it out of my backpack always have to search inside the bag for the case eventually just took it off and got a hard shell case instead",3,1
"I ordered this because it said it was for a Kindle 2.  It is too large, obviously designed for the original kindle.  That makes it pretty much a bust for my purpose -- to protect my kindle -- as the kindle can easily fall out of it.",3,1
This is a nice piece of equipment for the price.  However pyramid audio tech support is non existant.  I e-mailed several times with my problem and they have yet to answer.  I will not purchase anything again from Pyramid audio.,3,1
"No choice of more stylish colors. No ability to fold back cover, as the clasp sticks out in your way while you are reading screen. Nice size and portability. If other issues could be worked on this would be a better product.",3,1
"Cable charged my 5S quickly, but unfortunately stopped working after about a month. I would be interested in a replacement because the construction of the product seemed to be of good quality. Hoping it was a fluke.",3,2
Works great and easy to program. My only complaint is the lock/unlock buttons were backward. My unlock button will lock the doors and visa versa.,3,1
"I wanted to really love the sleeve - the quality is amazing and it looks like it would cost 2-3X more than it does.  At the end of the day though I had to return it, just too much effort to get the iPad Air 2 in and out of the sleeve.  I think if they made it with a little bit of plush lining and some give to it, it would have been a perfect iPad sleeve.",3,1
"When comparing models, note that the size of this one is vastly overstated.  The frame is 17&#34;, the screen is 14.1&#34; and in 16 x 9 format the picture is very small.  I am just waiting for someone to manufacture a higher quality flip down TV for my new Ford Transit Passenger van.  This one is just good enough that I don't want to take it down and return it.",3,1
"I really like it and I'd buy it again.  My only issue (maybe I'm picky) is with using it in my car.  When it is on my dashboard there is just enough vibration that my camera needs to be constantly adjusted, and while I'm driving that is very dangerous.  So I have video of the sky or my hood (don't ask, it's something I like to do with time laps).",3,1
"I purchased this clock/radio to use with my Iphone...it will charge and play my Iphone, but I have to put it in 'airplane mode' to do so...the sound quality sucks pretty bad, and the basic operation of the clock/alarm functions is pretty sucky as well...but at this price point they are all cheaply made, its crazy how just adding an ipod dock to a clock/radio makes it somehow cost $50, when this unit probably cost $1 to make",3,2
the stand braeks off easy.,3,1
The key ring cannot fit into the unit; it started to scratch the corner so I can't use it at all.  Other items are fine.,3,2
"We took this stove on a 5 day group camping trip and had to fix no meals only make our own coffee. If we'd had to cook we'd have been in trouble after 3 days. We drink a lot of coffee and shared some so we averaged about 3 twelve cup pots a day. We've used Coleman stoves in the past and judged our supply accordingly so took 8 bottles with us. We used just over 4 bottles of fuel just for the coffee. If we'd had to cook three meals a day also, we'd have been out of fuel by the end of the third day. To top it off, the igniter only worked intermittently for the first couple of days and then it quit altogether. As far as heat and controls the stove works fine and the cooking area is a good size. We'll probably keep this one in reserve and go back to the Coleman.",3,1
This mini cam works great ! Water proof ! Very little vibration and I have mine mounted on a motor cycle .<br />Good quality . I would recommend it,3,1
"I got this key for my wife so that she could have her own key for my Stang. We went to the hardware store to get it cut. After the store, I tried it out and it works great for unlocking the door. But it will not start my Stang. This is the second product that we got from vendors from Amazon that we have had a problem with fit or other problems.",3,1
i love my smoking ever ecigs but there is no way i can find to return parts that dont work,3,1
"I have been using this transmitter for about four months not and it has just stopped working. It now shuts off after about 20 seconds of playing. It also wont change my I-Pod now.<br /><br />When it was working the sound only came out of the driver speaker, so I had to turn it up really loud. It will still sound odd though. The part that connects to the I-Pod was always lose. It would play out off all the car speakers if you held the it in an awkward way. And if you held it in a way it didn't like it wouldn't work.<br /><br />Other than that it did the job. The static wasn't so bad. It is full range. I was able to use 87.7. It's roll as a transmitter was good, always clear.",3,2
Didn't get it on due date. Work well with my alarm does what it says good product easy install nice,3,1
"I am having a hard time getting all the bubbles out from under the screen.  I followed directions to the \\""T\\"" but I still have lots of bubbles.  Each day I work on one or two more of the bubbles.  Some come out, some don't.  Little disappointed. But it does take care of the glare and is much easier to read in the sunlight.",3,2
"I bought this cable to make it easier to charge my devices on my bedside table at night, without adding an extension cord. I bought this cable and a 2m cable from the same brand. I noticed the next morning that my iPhone was fully charged, but my iPad was not. Later testing showed that the iPad was charging, but only very very slowly. Next I tried the cable with an iPad mini. This also did not completely charge overnight.<br /><br />Mechanically, the cable is fine. It fits the devices well, looks good, hasn't been getting dirty or tangled.<br /><br />So: good for iPhone or iPod, bad for iPad or iPad mini.",3,1
the problem that I have with it is that it keeps blowing fusesother than that I love it thanks in advance,3,1
Easy to use adaptor.  It does freeze up some times and no radio channels are available. It did work fairly well on a recent car trip.,3,1
"I purchased this one and half month back. This looks good, fits well, but the major disadvantage is the corners are coming out after some time.",3,2
"Its design its not fitting the IPOD quite well, casuing some visibility problems of the display and front camera, front camera pictures some times look blocked",3,1
"For the money I expect a better picture.  Video cord was long enough.  The wiring used for the backup signal is a high gauge wire like 22 or 24.  I didn't like that.  But it works fine, no issues.",3,1
"works well for the cheapest car radio on the maket.  if you want cheap, this is it!",3,1
"This unit works great, but the controls on the plastic case are embossed white-on-white, which drives me crazy.<br />(My eyes aren't the best, but still....) I use it to feed two AR self-amplified speakers & the sound is great. And I'm happy to be using the speakers again, since the set-up is so portable. But adjustments are dicey unless you use it everyday & can remember what each touch-button will do. Would it have been that difficult to label them with a contrasting color?<br />I don't use it for running or exercise so have no idea how stable the sound is when the unit is jostled. Maybe some of the other reviews will help with that. And, I haven't been using it for long so can't meaningfully speak about its durability. Build quality is just so-so, my sense it it will not last as long as my previous player, which is so old it was made of metal & even manufactured by Sony in Japan! Imagine that.",3,1
"My wife loved the cover at first, but after a couple of months it broke and would not snap shut anymore.",3,2
Pretty nice watch. Good options. But the battery died after 3 weeks. Not what I expected for the money spent.,3,2
"DO NOT leave this item stuck to the shower wall when not in use. Mine fell ONCE and has not worked since. Aside from that, the sound was Great, rich, full, enjoyable for the shower. PLUS you can answer your phone with a touch of a button. very cool unit. Just wish it was a bit sturdier.. Sad that ONE oops is all it took...",3,2
"I'm really good at putting things together. You HAVE to use all the new parts from the key fob, including the blade, (you'll have to get it cut for your car), otherwise it won't work. I have a 2012 camaro, the blades for the camaro do not fit onto the hinge for it. The pin is in a different place. if you try to use your old hinge, it doesn't shut the key/blade all the way in. In addition, you will have to super glue the sides together. Again, it WILL WORK if you use the blade that comes with the new FOB.",3,2
"This product worked better than I expected. My friend bought a transmitter that was about $50 and didn't work near aswell as mine. I hardly had any cut outs or interferences from other radio stations. The only complaint is that the charger stopped working after a month or so, so I needed a fully battery when playing music. (DOES NOT FIT WITH AN OTTER BOX) I had to modify the bottom end of my otter box so that the plug in would fit.",3,2
"I purchased this to go in a 1986 Peterbilt 359 which has just come out of a $125,000 restoration year long process.  In other words, I didn't want to spend $60 more on a direct cable from Pioneer and have all the work of running the cable (more the cable than the price tag).<br /><br />The device works.  I like how it comes with the power and the audio on one cable and it splits the two about 8 inches or so from the end, therefore you don't have the mess of two independent wires.<br /><br />The reason I have this at three stars instead of four is simple: there is too much signal noise in the transmitter.  I imagine this will vary among the different vehicles and I have to admit I haven't tried this in my Impala SS yet.  Support was quick to respond and friendly, while asking me to make sure the media volume on the EVO was turned all the way up, so as to overcome the signal noise.  The volume was all the way up and it didn't do anything for the noise.  DON\\""T get me wrong, the noise isn't terrible, but it is noticeable.  This is the 2nd gen of this transmitter.  Maybe in Gen 3 they can address this situation more.<br /><br />Overall, knowing this I still like the device.  The transmitter is dead stupid simple.  You can't mess it up!",3,2
"I took a chance, there were some poor reviews of this camera, but some good ones too.  I have no problem with the quality of the video, it's quite good even at low light conditions.  My problem is getting it to work with Wifi, I've tried two different smart phones and a laptop to make a connection, but it says &#34;signal too weak&#34; with all the units.  I wrote to Blackvue asking for help, and they did write back after a week with some suggestions (which I had already tried)but it still does not work.  I don't know if I have a bogus unit or it's like this with a lot of units, but if you need a smart phone connection....this isn't your camera to buy.  I think they need some more engineering on the wireless connection.  It does fit well on the windshield right behind the mirror, so it doesn't look conspicuous.  Wiring was fairly easy.  So, 3 stars for this one, good luck if you try it.",3,2
"I purchased this for a friend and he is a bit disappointed with the size, weight and it does not play cds. Besides that it light up beautiful plays ok",3,1
It's nice n small trying to get my music on it..comes with no charger or instructions on what does what.my friends out there this player comes with no charger no instructions n you also need to purchase a micro sd tf. card.or it will not play on a normal sd card...I did my homework they do not..happy buying,3,1
"This game needs the ability to put a card into a certain spot in your hand.  When you draw a card the game decides, and not always wisely, where to place the card in your hand which can be both confusing and wrong.  I have played better gin rummy games online with more features.",3,2
"I received this product very fast and it was packaged well.  I bought it on a whim and haven't had opportunity to use it yet so I can't say if it will really suit my purpose...bought it to use on trips, but right now it is in my way.",3,1
"It did work, but broke not long after purchase.  My son is pretty hard on things in general, so this may not be a great choice for hard use.",3,2
"Reuse is a bit of a push, but then again, why would you try? I would think most people would just stick it on and leave it until either it or the iPod dies. It stays in place and is easy to see through.",3,1
"This is a much cheaper version of the old one,I have the 1st generation Nano and think it is much better. Granted, that one didn't have a window in it, but you can't really see it while you are running...<br /><br />This one is much thinner and barely fits on my arm. I am worried that once the velcro starts to go, I will have to replace the armband negating any savings on this model (it is less expensive). It also is not as elastic as the first generation.<br /><br />I would love to know if there is another brand out there that holds the Nike +.",3,1
"I originally bought this clock for the ability to charge my phone.  It works ok, the antenna is not great so if you move it around once you've found the station, the station may go out.  It charges my iPhone 5 which is a huge plus since many clocks will not charge the iPhone 5.  My only real complaint would be the snooze button only snoozes for 7 minutes.  Why it's 7 and not 10 like most clocks, I don't know, but it's not long enough!  Also, you have to be careful to hit only the small snooze button otherwise you might turn off the alarm.  One other thing that is a little of a nuisance is setting the time.  There is not a separate time set for hour and minute so you have to scroll through the 24 hour day to set a different time.",3,1
the delivery was good and I was pumpd to get the case and the film. Film is nice and it sticks well without bubbles or anything. But the case was a little too tight and the inner part of the case was a bit rough so that my ipod might get scratched. Well good for 7 99,3,1
Im happy with it but you get what you pay for. not as nice as original but awesome for the price,3,1
The gps doesn't have the features that I wanted and I have to return it. It probably works fine for some users but I wanted lifetime traffic and  maps so I have to return it.,3,1
"The unit it nice and works mostly as advertised. There is NO instruction manual, printed or electronic. Emails to the seller go unanswered in my case. If you are handy then installation is pretty straightforward and wires are clearly labeled (the one piece of paper in the box with the serial number says that the warranty isn't valid unless professionally installed).<br />It takes about 10 seconds to boot up after starting the vehicle and the GPS takes at least another 10 seconds to boot. So if you want to start up and enter an address it will take at least 30 seconds to start entering.<br />Once in a while it will not power up and requires a complete vehicle power down and restart...it's odd and as I said, the seller will not answer my emails.<br />Overall, the radio is nice and I do not currently use the bluetooth or camera functions.<br />The DVD player works well as long as the sun is not shining....the kids can't see the screen for the glare, but it is fine in the evening or at night.",3,1
I bought this item for my Iphod touch a while back and it was a nice item the pink was a tad different then the pink in the picture and the case was alittle big but over it was a decetn item for the price I paid,3,2
"I'd give it 5 stars for design & ergonomic flexibility.  It really is beautiful - slim, sleek & sexy & I LOVE the anti-glare coating.  The monitor itself is very lightweight for its size (only like 15 pounds) and the stand is very sturdy.  I really like the 45 degree rotation on it's horizontal axis, which allows me to swivel swiftly & easily from optimal desk chair viewing over to the sofa very easily, and it's like magic the way it vertically slides from 2.5 - 9 inches up off the desk, staying wherever I stop lifting.  It tilts up/backwards nicely, but it doesn't tilt forward/down at all, which would have been nice since it's so big & I'm kinda short.  The whole monitor can pivot from wide screen to tall screen, which is kinda cool, but I can't imagine what I'd use that feature for (maybe if somebody sends me an iPhone video filmed vertically?).    It can function as a USB hub, which is a nifty bonus.  But it only takes DP or DVI cables - an HDMI input would have been really nice for flexibility & that was almost a deal killer for me, but the tradeoff that made it all worthwhile for me is the Plane Line Switching (PLS).  According to this great review on CNet [...], PLS gives this monitor beautiful graphics in all lighting conditions AND makes it one of the most energy efficient monitors on the market - it even has a little digital tree that grows leaves as you save energy :)    It was the ergonomic flexibility, energy efficiency & anti-glare screen that made me choose this monitor over the new Apple Thunderbolt.    Now I WISH I could rave about the picture, but I haven't been able to see anything but the menu yet b/c although they say it's Mac compatible, even w/ the $99 Dual DVI/Thunderbolt adapter my 2011 MacBook Pro can't detect the display.  So much for plug & play :(    I'm gonna call Samsung tomorrow & then update this review one way or the other. There may be something wrong w/ the monitor b/c most of the on-board menu options aren't even live & selectable.  I've spent hours fiddling w/ it & troubleshooting, but nothing works.    Here's hoping I won't need to sing the praises of Amazon's awesome return policy...    Update 3/1/12 - I'm singing the praises Samsung's customer support center today.  I promptly spoke to a live person & within minutes we assessed that the monitor is malfunctioning.  They're sending me a pre-paid shipping label & anticipate fixing & returning the monitor to me within 2 weeks.  Stay tuned for another update.",3,1

This item is cheap so for the price I think is good enough. If you are looking to buy something to protect your iPod from case scratches this might be good enough. It is not intended to protect your iPod if is dropped since the case will break or open. It does not cover the screen.  It is a light weight cover.<br /><br />I like it because its transparent and it protects it from getting scratched in my purse.,3,1

"I would love this case if only the pen fit in better.  It feels nice, is lightweight, and leaves all of the ereader functions available.  The only complaint I have is that the pen does fit in it but then it doesn't close very well.  Partially sony's fault for squaring off the pen shape for this model.",3,1
"It does amplify sound, but is very touchy. It is like a stethoscope. It is good for laying beside you when you are sitting watching tv or in a small group conversation.",3,1

"Radio was shipped promptly and arrived in good shape.  All aspects of the radio function, however performance on the 220 MHz band is weak particularly on receive but also transmitting.  Barely reaches a repeater 12 miles away and then with noise.  Suspect this unit is not optimized for 220 MHZ and the antenna shows no resonance when checked on an antenna analyzer.  I would not recommend this radio if you want to operate on 220 MHZ.  The vendor however is more than acceptable.",3,2

"Although it's universal \\""one size fit all\\"", it works great with my Garmin Nuvi 285WT. The spacers provided helps in tighter fit but, it's still a bit loose and adding your own will eliminate whatever extra looseness there is.   There's only one reason for the 1 star rating, see #3;   1. Item arrived with 2 minor \\""scrape marks\\"" on the clear window plastic. Luckily, it wasn't in the center of the window.   2. The mounting clamp to the handle bar for my motorcycle showed a sign of weakness, started to turn white, after 2 days of being mounted.   Upon contacting the vendor, I was offered an upgrade clamp at no charge.   Initial shipment arrived ahead of schedule, USPS of all things, customer service replied within minutes of sending e-mail and tried to resolve the issues at hand professionally.   For those of you looking for similar item, from this or any other vendor, look for a better clamping device(upgraded heavy duty ones, if available). Considering it hold an expensive device in place, additional few dollars is well worth the price.   When the replacement clamp arrive, I will re-rate the product to 5 stars, if possible, just for the excellent customer service, which is rare now days.  3.Well, I received no \\""upgraded\\"" clamp. In fact, never heard from them again after e-mailing them and informed them that I reconsidered the return and opted to accept their offer of \\""upgrade\\"". It's now been @ week since the last e-mail.  Update: I finally got a reply stating that person in charge of my order is on vacation and thing got backed up. Regardless, I did receive the upgraded mounting clamp as offered and it will work for me. Hope it didn't take so long to get this resolved, the product was worth the price paid, the service needs improvement but at least it got done. Therefore, I'm upgrading the star rating from 1 star to 3 for finally resolving the issue.",3,1

"So i Just got this in the mail , and I must say that I'm oh-so-slightly disappointed. For one, the case does not hold the iTouch tight enough & that makes it somewhat easy to come off. Two , the reason why I chose this Product is because it had my favorite color, pink. But when I saw it face to face it wasnt exactly that color. It appeared to be a darker pink -- more like purplish.     other than that , it's pretty good. It looks good & does what its supposed to which is Protect it from scratches , so im happy .

But, it kept playing no matter how many times I paused it. This became a real problem when I went to dock my phone and set the alarm to go to bed. The music would not stop playing and I had to lower the volume just to get to bed.<br />Overall I still think that this lamp isn't terrible. I mean, it's very cute and the lighting is great.

"I have mixed feelings about this dashcam.<br /><br />First it is made in China and the thin owner's manual is almost inscrutable. Surely they can hire an American proof-reader to give an explanation of how to use all the features.<br /><br />Secondly, the unit does not always turn on when first starting the vehicle. Occasionally you have to manually turn it on which is an irritation. Most times it powers up without doing anything.<br /><br />Lastly, the mini-CD that comes with it is a joke. It refused to work on several of my Windows 7 computers. I have no idea what it does.<br /><br />As an upnote, it does seem to record well and tranferring the files to the computer is as easy as inserting the flash drive and clicking on the files you are interested in.<br /><br />Another irritating thing - when the unit is connected to the computer via the USB cable you cannot operate any of the controls. It only charges the internal battery, and after charging you must disconnect it and you have about 5 minutes to program the unit before the battery charge dies.<br /><br />I am puzzled as to how this thing got so many good reviews. I believe other manufacturers such as Canon, Nikon, Sony, and Panasonic are missing out on a good thing by not making their own dashcams along with clear instructions.",3,1
"Love that I can where this like a watch, but the only security is that it wraps around the nano like an iPhone case would. Since I wear it for running I am always afraid it might fall out if bumped because I broke a 6th gen nano that was in a watch case much like this one.  I typically hold it just to be sure it isn't going to accidentally fall out.",3,1
Mine drains batteries in a few days seemingly irregardless of use.  Lots of batteries to be replacing.  Less useful without the portibility.,3,1
Not a bad camera for the price. Instructions very hard to read had to use a magnifying glass. Daytime picture is really clear night vision is blurred  something terrible. Had to figure out this camera on my own instructions could be a lot better. Suction cup was not the one in the picture but I like the one they sent me a lot better. Turn motion detector off or the camera keeps turning on soon as you touch it. Battery lasts around 5 minutes so you have to keep it plugged into the car at all times. The on off feature works great when you start the car and turn it off. Cannot find in the menu how to turn the G sensor on otherwise for what I am using it for it is well worth the money.,3,1
While I like the Dream Machine I don't know why there's so much static. It's nearly impossible to get a couple of my favorite radio stations without constant static in the background. My other radio doesn't do that. I've even tried different locations for it. That's a big disappointment and shortcoming of the product.,3,2
It doesn't stand for very long on its own and within a month and a half it broke not the best item but it worked for a short amount of time.,3,2
Worked great. The sound is not as bad as some people said,3,1
"Being a long-time fan of Cambridge Soundworks products, I had high expectations for the Oontz. For its size, the sound quality is surprisingly good. One shouldn't expect deep bass from such small drivers; if you are looking for body-thumping low end sound, better look at something much bigger. There are some misleading instructions in the brief manual -- e.g. if you want to use it with a wired connection, when first turned on you must go through the steps to start Bluetooth mode and then double-press the &#34;Source&#34; button to select wired mode. In wired mode, volume setting must be done on the input device (MP3 player, phone, etc) because the Oontz's volume buttons only work in Bluetooth mode. Overall, it can be a great speaker for travel use as it'll tuck away into the smallest corner of a suitcase.",3,1
Battery capacity is too small. It lasts only for about 3 hours.,3,2
"Great sound, but difficult to synch with engine speed.",3,1
"First off, Seller was Great!!!!! Product, not an exact fit. Had to modify it to fit.",3,1
I didn't realize that the material it is made of would be so cheap but the iPod fits but I wish it had a strap to keep it closed when not in use.,3,2
"This helps with being able to place my iPod Touch in a JBL speaker system, but it does lean very far.  I am a bit worried that it will damage the JBL, but it is very sturdy.  I am gentle with use and it appears if anything breakes, it will be the extender.  I have used this for some time now and have had no problems.  Still don't like how it sits in the speaker dock!",3,1
"Likes:  - Seems well made: gold-plated on both ends, decent connector, nice cable jacket, etc.  - It's black, not white  - Mine is made in Japan  - Nice anti-static zip lock package (kind of overkill, but I like attention to detail)    Not so much:  - Not as smooth to plug in as the Apple connector.  Maybe this will change after a bit of use, but the Apple connector seemed to work smoothly from day one.  I feel better squeezing the release buttons on the connector when plugging it in.  Otherwise sometimes one side will catch and it feels like I might snap something.  Again, this will probably improve with use.  One thing I noticed is that the prongs that stick out the sides (they retract and keep the connector attached) seem a tad longer and are definitely sharper than those on the Apple connector.  I might try using fine sandpaper or a light buffer on these and see if I can make the connector smoother.  You know how when you get a key made at the hardware store they do this after the new key is cut?  Same idea.  =)  Another thing I noticed is that the connector (dock side) plastic is thinner than that of Apple's.  To be clear, the outside dimension is of course the same as Apple's, but when you squeeze (admittedly HARD) on the FiiO connector you can feel a wee bit of flex.  The Apple connector on the other hand feels like it's a solid piece of plastic.  Not a big deal but worth mentioning.    I use this for my iPad and iPod Mini.  On the later it will not go in all the way unless I press the release buttons.  This is not a big deal and easy to get used to, but I much prefer the smoothness and 'click' of the Apple connectors.  Too bad Apple doesn't make this- let alone in black.",3,1
"Very good sound, the supply cables are not long enough that so often it falls and gets rip of the computer causing terminals to rip off and render speaker useless unable to repair, must be replace with others with longer leads.",3,2

"Purchased in 2012, the New SPOT 2 Satellite GPS Messenger for a crossing of outer Mongolia expedition (without support vehicles) on a mountain bike. I needed regular updates sent on my location to update my family, the unit failed to do so once all summer. If this unit (Made in China) is unreliable, Customer Service is FINALLY trying to REPLACE IT UNDER WARRANTY after exchanging 15 emails, including sharing with SPOT Customer Service, a story that was published in an interview I had, including mention of this device failed product. They responded with their own article, 2000 successful rescues recorded (is that even necessary?).  My unit had fresh lithium batteries and replacements, it appeared to be fully functional during use, but sent no updates, or location emails/I'm OK messages all summer long. 45 days with this little unit was useless energy spent, the failed SOS message sent/turned into pure hell. Some are lucky with their units, others not. Service plan PLUS rescue option is EXPENSIVE and WORTHLESS when your unit fails to operate in the field. Too late on an expedition, and fortunately, I was able to rescue myself when I sent the unanswered SOS distress signals. NEVER AGAIN.<br /><br />Update! 2012-10-26. Spot Messenger Satellite GPS was taken under WARRANTY and tested. FAILED.<br />The customer service was good once I got through to their exterior shells of corporate bs.  I had opportunity to send it in for testing and they REPLACED IT and RENEWED the subscriptions I paid for 2012. This is GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE (+ one star)<br /><br />These products are Made in China, so let the buyer beware, the unit is inexpensive considering the technology bundled into it, but subscriptions are required to use it and that isn't cheap - yearly fee will be incurred. I met a motorcycle tourer that used his from Germany to Mongolia, and he had A+++ RESULTS and the unit was RELIABLE (+ one star, making my review a THREE STAR REVIEW). I guess it depends on the unit you receive from the Chinese factory, where quality control is important.",3,2

"I bought this sports armband at the same time I bought the iPod Nano (5th.)  I also purchased a clear plastic protection case for the iPod.    The armband is quite acceptable for the price I paid.  It is made from quite thin neoprene with a flexible clear plastic cover over the controls and image display.  I haven't had it long so I can't tell anything about durability. MY prime objection is to the tightness of the pouch where the iPod is placed.  It's so tight that it is very difficult to insert the player.  Since it is neoprene it may loosen with age.  Of course, I have to remove the plastic protection case to insert the iPod, so that is another drawback for me.",3,1
good,3,1
"I installed it myself with no instuctions available. I am very mechanically inclined with some electronic training. Difficulty level of 10/10 in my opinion. I still have dim and missing pixels,but overall better than before installed.",3,1
"I got this transmitter just a couple of days ago. All the parts were as mentioned in the product description. The moment I plugged in my iPod intot this device, it immediately recognized the transmitter and started broadcasting my music. Worked best on 88.3, which I think was kind of preset into the transmitter (something like factory setting). There were only a couple of instances in Los Angeles downtown where I observed some disturbance in the music I played. Otherwise the sound quality was fantastic. If not hard, it wasn't very easy for me to fit this into my car's power point either. But after installation, it gets ample space even when the gear stick is in Parking position (I own Honda Accord EX 2007). I see few people having problems fitting this device into their cars. The multifunction remote which comes with the transmitter kind of makes it easy to browse through the iPod library and change songs without looking at the iPod with just a gentle push of a button. Makes me observe safe driving practices! Overall I would say this is a good product. The only reason I have given 3 star rating is because I have had it only for a couple of days. I will update my rating as I get some more experience using it over time.      Update: 5/20/2009  Couple of days ago, the transmitter just stopped working. It wasn't turning ON. So I emailed  customer service to convey the problem. I got the reply back on the same day, telling me to ship the part to get it exchanged. And then I got the new part within just few days. The service was surprisingly good, prompt, and less painful! The new product is working fine as of now.",3,1
I've had it for a couple of weeks. works but sometimes has a static sound. I have to unplug it and unplug it to get it to work and sometimes it doesn't go away. I don't use it very often but the audio is loud and for the price i guess i cant really complain too much.,3,2
This is not really made for the 7&#34; Magellan. It better fits something larger about<br />9&#34; . It just too big and thick.<br />I put my old tablet in a case in it,3,2
"PROS:<br />● Does what is is supposed to<br />● Inexpensive<br />● Remembers where you were, even after charging<br />●Sounds good, loud enough<br />● Simple iPod controls with on-off - kind of (see below)<br />● Long play time<br />● Flashes when playing, so if you do not have the earphones in, you can tell if it is playing<br /><br />CONS:<br />● Does not come with SD card (inexpensive).  An audiobook is about 1GB, which is an inexpensive card, so it is no big deal.<br />● Earphones cheap<br />● Earphones short<br />● Charging QUIRK - even when the player is &#34;off&#34;, when you plug it in to charge, it starts playing and you can go far past where  you are in the book or album.  This is important because if you are charging in the car, the charger probably cuts off when you turn off the engine and starts again when you start the engine again.  This means that the player will play without you knowing it and lose your place.",3,1

Then I discovered that one of the straps that hold the iPad in place, had broken, and within a day my iPad was literally sliding out of the case!

It seemed to be a good mp3/4 player with a lot of features for a good price.  I got it for my 14-yr-old and he seems to like it.  He has had it for 2 mos and it stopped working.

They claimed the products were new and clearly they were not. The cases and screen protector were the best things in the bundle. Its a good price for a bundle they just shouldn't say something is new when it has some brown gunk on it.,3,1

"This product is incorrectly labeled as one for the iPod Classics. The case is too large, and would only fit an iPod Video. I have a 160gb Classic, and this thing was like putting a Magnum XL on an asian...",3,1
"I just received my case and here are my initial findings.<br /><br />Firstly I want to mention that this case comes with a hard plastic screen cover that is hinged at the top.  This cover is relatively lame for two reasons.  1) The tabs on the window just slip into knotches/holes in the soft silicone cover, which easily stretches and therefore the screen will probably fall off easily.  2) If dust or debris gets between this loose cover and the bare LCD screen it will obviously scratch.  That would be true for ANY case with a screen cover, however, so to the hapless 1-star ranters, if you scratched your screen you are not completely without responsibilty.  Therefore you should always ALSO have the stick-on LCD protector on the screen as well.  I think it is smart (as well as a good hint) that they include them in the Amazon package in the first place.  (If you order direct from the supplier, you'll note that they're sold separately.)<br /><br />This issue also applies to the rest of the player.  While the case fits nicely, it's not an extremely tight, sealed fit.  Therefore if you carry it in your pocket or a bag, dust can and will get between the player and the case and could scratch the button surfaces as well.  As the back of the Zen is metal and has sort of a matte finish you shouldn't ever have noticable surface scratches on the back (unlike the polished metal back of the ipod).  So bottom line, I'll probably need to take the player out of the case from time to time and clean it, however it may be that some scratching will be unavoidable unless you only use it in a 'clean-room' environment.<br /><br />My last disappointment is that one of the the main reasons I bought it was to be able to use the kickstand on my desk.  While it works, the base is not wide enough making it quite wobbly such that a slight tug on the headphones wire will topple it over.  You'd think the designer could at least figure out how to shape a simple piece of wire to make the stand stable.  On the other hand, I do have to give them credit for providing two tiny rubber tubes for providing some grip for the kickstand.  I then take that credit away as they make you put them on yourself, plus they are clear and so small such that if you didn't know they were there you could easily throw them away.  Plus, since there's no instructions provided, and as the masses tend to have no clue, I imagine lots of people have seen them and still thrown them away not knowing what they were.<br /><br />Otherwise the case is just ok.  Buttons work through the case and the touch pad is accessible, but clicking it to the left and right is tougher with the case on.  The headphone jack plugs in unimpeded, while the dongle (uhh-huh-huh) does plug in, but just barely, so it pops off quite easily if bumped.<br /><br />Unfortunately due to the dismal variety of accessories for the Zen, you don't have many other choices, especially if you don't want a bulky leather case, so it'll due for now.stable.

The first day on my truck it filled up with water so I took it apart and used epoxy on the threads and Teflon tape and it never leaked after that. Good Wide Image.  Good Color.

"This suction cup mount works well enough. I'm in California where it is illegal to attach the GPS to the window, so my first GPS Mount, which attached to the vent eventually failed breaking the power cord connection with it and I had to get something else.<br /><br />If you can stick this to a window it probably works great. I have attached the flat circle that comes with the GPS to the dash, below the radio, it obscures the view of the radio while I drive, but the GPS is easy to see.<br /><br />The only negative attributes are that you can't hide the whole instillation, yes the suction cup and of course the GPS itself are removable, but as the circle platform is stuck to a vertical surface, I try not to put a lot of tension  on it by putting the suction cup on and off, because the adhesive isn't meant to hold the weight and it won't stick forever. The same is true of the suction cup it stuck great to begin with, but as time went on it now falls off occasionally. This can be very annoying while driving. This problem happens most often when the car gets very hot, as in black car parked out in california summer sun all day. As of yet it is still useable, and short of the weighted GPS dash mounts it is one of the only choices.",3,1

"Bought this to use running. MP3 player fits perfectly within the cover however the slits on the back where the arm band fit through are much too long so the elastic strap slides up and down a bit too much. Likewise, when using the belt clip, (which connects in the center of the back between the slits for the armband), it too is too loose and mp3 player flops around significantly if you are trying to run. Might be ok for walking, but belt clip is not suitable for running. The armband is 'ok' - if it is pulled tight enough there isn't a lot of movement, but it could be better.

"The product works as advertised. You can tune to the station that is clear of radio communications and then run your ipod. The only trick is in dense cities where there are radio stations on every channel, then getting a clear station to broadcast your ipod on is difficult.

My best bet is to tune into 88.1 in the South Bay Area, or some radio station where its pure static (no other station in the area broadcasting at this frequency)",3,1

"there's a reason it's the cheapest armband.  the velcro fasteners are just velcro circles glued to the armband, and mine are already peeling off after a few weeks.  That said, it does work, holds the ipod securely while still letting you use the controls, so I can't be too upset.  I just won't buy another one.",3,2
"I purchased my Magellan Roadmate 9020 GPS directly from the Magellan website. This is a good unit but it does have some faults as stated here. 1.) I haven't experienced any of the screen washout issues that other reviewers reported, but I did experience a problem with the power cord that other reviewers have commented on. I had an issue with my unit going dead and leaving me stranded while traveling, because unbeknownst to me, the connector wouldn't fit snug into the unit causing it to eventually lose its charge and go dead. It took some time and an attempted modification, before I realized the windshield mount was designed so that the power cord actually slides into place and locks in the mount, which then allows you to take the GPS and leave the mount attached to the windshield with the power cord. 2.) After several years of use, I've deleted addresses from the unit. Whenever an address is deleted, you're forced to re-scroll through every address in your unit to get back to where you were when you deleted the last address, because the database takes you back to the first address. This is not a big issue, just a bit annoying. 3.) The last major concern that I have is that I thought the bigger 7\\"" screen would be an improvement when compared to most of the smaller Magellan and Garmin screens. Unfortunately the windshields on most of todays vehicles make it hard to mount this size GPS and keep the unit straight. The angle of the windshields and the proximity of the instrument panel forces you to tilt this Magellan into an awkward position depending on your vehicle. 4.) This unit requires the use of both hands to separate it from the windshield mount and there is no instruction manual that explains anything. 5.) Magellan is NOT Mac compatible, which is disappointing considering the number of users who probably use Apple products.<br /><br />Now some pros: This unit does offer a lifetime map option that must be purchased separately. The downloads take awhile depending on your internet connection so start early if you're planning a long trip. After registering for a Magellan account online, you can synchronize your address book to your computer and then keep it updated by routine synchronization. This is a decent unit as long as you're okay with all of it's shortfalls.n your internet connection so start early if you're planning a long trip.

"I fully charged the device on AC to 100%.  My Motorola Razr Maxx had 40% battery left, so I used the device to recharge the Razr. It only charged the Razr Maxx to 70%, then the device was depleted.  In all fairness, I realize the Razr Maxx has the largest internal battery for Smartphones available.  But I would have expected the device to deliver more than a 30% charge (40% + 30% = 70%) The purpose for which I purchased the device I guess will remain, that is, in a situation where I need power to the phone when none is available to charge, then this device will work, but only for short term use.  Considering the size of the Razr Maxx battery, the 30% charge would provide several hours of either data or voice use.",3,1
"Case is great, but if you don't have fingernails you will not be able to use the Lock switch on top of the iPOD.  Other than that, no problems.  Case functions as intended and is well made.",3,1
Purchased these as a Christmas gift.  I Haven't really heard anything good or bad since they were put into use.,3,1
This adapter works great when wired through the aux port! But when it is tuned to a radio station there is some low background noise like white noise. It is still a good deal because it holds the ipod and charges it while you listen to your music. Great price too.,3,1
"The unit is mostly fine, but I do have the following issues that are more annoyances than anything.<br />- intermittent noise on BT - once every few hours, the music cuts out and the stereo plays noise for a few seconds before reverting back to music.<br />- iPhone integration doesn't work that well.  Sometimes the phone starts playing right away when hooked up, sometimes it takes a few minutes, sometimes it doesn't at all.<br />- The first time you use siri it almost never works - the head unit triggers siri and cuts it off right away.",3,2
This was not the quality I expected.  The material was very cheap looking.  I personally wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  Maybe in another color it would look better but I did not like it.,3,2
Overall these are nice switches.<br />Connectors are a bit weak and are easily pushed into the switch.<br />Not sure why I thought these had red LED's but blue is fine too ;-),3,1
"I bought these and immediately put one on my Kindle to help protect it.  It does it's job in protecting, but there are some bubbles in it. They give you a little cardboard thing and instructions how to get out the bubbles, but I cant seem to get them all out. Also it is a little difficult to line up the cover exactly with the screen.  I also do not like the extra glare that it adds on.  It is annoying to have on, but I will probably keep it on for now since I like the extra protection it gives.",3,1
"Close to perfect and the best iPod nano case+band I've been able to find.    Silicone case provides the right amount of protection from drops, bumps, etc...    Arm band is comfortable and easy to put on/take off.    Only gripe is the screen protector.  It is too big and its edges overlap the metal part of the iPod, making it easy for the screen protector to peel off, collect dust and dirt, etc...  They should trim it down so that it fits just inside the edges of the screen, not overlap them or touch them. It is also too stiff--it does not adhere to the curved surface of the iPod nano.    Fortunately, Grantwood has some decent, mostly no-hassle customer service. Unfortunately, they dishonestly act like they have no clue what is wrong with the screen protectors until you return the third one (at which point they finally admitted that it does not work well with the curved surface of the iPod).

It's rather big and bulky plus it doesn't work so well with the power cord being plugged into the bottom of the GPS. You have to finagle the cord through a slit on the back of the mount to even make it workable.  Not really for the GPS you guys say it's for.  Not particularly happy with it.,3,2

"I bought this Literati from woot.com for a little less than $50. I already own a Kindle 3, but I had read a number of reviews before buying this one and wasn't expecting it to compare favorably to my Kindle. I purchased the Literati mainly for my kids to use since I am loathe to let my Kindle out of my hands.<br /><br />My initial reaction upon receiving the Literati was that it is a nicer package than I expected. It comes with a well-designed, protective case - a big plus since a case is essential. The Literati feels flimsier than my Kindle and I suspect it wouldn't survive being dropped very often. The keyboard at the bottom is adequate, but the navigation wheel is woefully small. Since you use the nav wheel heavily, this is a big issue. I began using the eraser end of a pencil almost immediately for this.<br /><br />The wifi setup was easy, and it picked up all the wireless networks in my neighborhood immediately. Please note: your wireless router must be set to broadcast your SSID. If not, there is no way to manually set up a network it cannot \\""see\\"". Also note, depending upon the unit you get, your firmware will automatically upgrade as soon as you set up your wifi. Apparently there is no way to upgrade your firmware other than via wifi.<br /><br />To use your Literati, go to kobobooks dot com to download and install the desktop application on your computer. You can also install it from your Literati via the supplied usb cable, but that is slow and not the latest version. Once you have installed the app and set up a Kobo account, you can purchase books from Kobo. There is also a limited selection of free books at Kobo, although certainly not the number or wide selection available on Amazon.

You will need to recharge every day or two, depending upon your usage.<br /><br />My final thoughts are that if you get a Literati for $50 or less, you will have a basic e-reader with some really nice features and a few quirks. It meets my expectations at less than $50. At the list price, you will be much happier with a Kindle, although it lacks a color display.

The company sent me the wrong armband by sending one for  a nano.  The only benefit thus far is that they sent me a pair of headphones at no charge.

"I've been unable to get the Nike+ sensor to work correctly with this pouch. Apparently, the Nike+ sensor was designed to be positioned parallel to the ground and in about the middle of the shoe (with the red side facing up).  When I initially tried to use this pouch, the sensor was on a slight angle (as one would expect) which was enough to cause the distance measurements to very inaccurate - even beyond the point where calibration would help.  In the end, I ended up taking a Dremel to the sole of my shoe and made a nice comfy home for the sensor. Now my distance results are usually within ±5% of each mile.",3,2

"I tested the system in preparation for installation: the monitor produced a clear image in daylight; however, in the dark, the tiny lights surrounding the camera produced only enough infrared illumination to provide a spot.  I doubt it would be sufficient to provide bumper side-to-side coverage.  Color reproduction was poor in either lighting.  The camera requires a large hole, and this product package did not include a hole saw (I've seen some that do).  The rear view mirror has an ugly rectangular monitor in the middle that is visible even when not in use, and it's reflective character is different than the mirror flanking it on either side.  The connection cabling requires a filter/fuse box that contains a small circuit board.  I opened that box (as if to replace the fuse) and discovered a large capacitor that flopped around; apparently not properly soldered to the circuit board.  Fearing intermittent connectivity, I decided to return the purchase as defective merchandise.  The seller was good about giving me an RMA number and allowing me to choose a different brand.",3,2

"I purchase this cord a few weeks ago for my iPhone 5. It worked great for a week or so with no issues. After a week I updated my Operating system (which I knew might cause problems due to the rumors that non-apple products may not be supported/ compatible anymore). Despite my concerns the cord still was able to charge and sync my phone for another week or two, but unfortunately that all stopped one day out of the blue. From what I have read products from apple licensed companies such as Belkin (and I'm hoping iSmoothe) will still sell products that should work, as long as you stay away from the cheap $3 chinese counterfeits. I have been told if the package says something along the lines of &#34;made for/ compatible with iPhone&#34; it should still work. I will post an update in a month or so with my new product to see if these cords can still work, or are now completely useless thanks to apple.",3,2
The case is a little big. So the ipod slides around and makes it harder to match up to the click wheel and charger.,3,1
This is mailed from china with directions in Chinese. It is a combo not all in one. The box has many cords and parts in it. Also they do not tell you that to get what is advertised here you will need the 7 inch screen. I bought this one and I assumed it did all it says Mine came with a 5 inch screen so many of what they show here isn't programed. I want an all in one unit so I don't have all those cords. I am giving this a 3 because of how it isn't quite what I thought. I could not understand it so I gave it to my son. He could install it or hook it up without directions. So understand this is a seriously Made in China product. I haven't even used the thing so my review is sight only and I am generous with stars.

However, for those of you considering to buy the Fiio L9 L-shaped line out dock, please be warned that once connected too your iDevice, the volume control on your device is suspended and you have to use your Fiio amplifier to control the volume (not very convenient). Also, if you are going to use this adapter on your headphone, the sound quality is no different from the 3.5mm adapter that comes included with your Fiio headphone amplifier.

Not bad.  I say this because I haven't tried/used everything in the bundle.  But all of the products were in great new condition and individually wrapped.  Speaker works great and sounds good for its size.  It needs to be recharges occassionally and no batteries needed.  Car charger works well.  I love being able to listen to my playlist or HD radio in the car w/o headphones(not that I drive with headphones in).<br /><br />The only problem I had:  The travel charge makes my Zune HD go bonkers!  It totally disobeys my orders and flashes like its possessed or something.  After immediately unplugging I was happy it still worked and my playlist was intact.  Don't know if I can have just that one item replace.  I probably won't bother because I don't really need it.  All in all this isn't a bad deal.,3,1

"This is my first ever review, so please bear with me.  I ordered this product for a 2001 Ford Taurus.  It was a Christmas gift for my son.  The next afternoon we pulled the factory radio out and realized the cables would not match up.  After closer inspection of the USA SPEC PA11 directions, there is a small notation, for Taurus' and Sables an extra cable is required.  On those cars the tuner is in the trunk and just the control head is in the dash.  Well, we put the factory radio back in the dash and grumbled a little.  Nowhere in the Amazon description is any mention of needing an extra cable for a Taurus.  After more research on the internet we decided by the time we ordered the cable, it would be easier just to buy an aftermarket radio and a Metra in dash adapter (which came with the elusive cable).  Best Buy had the Metra kit and radio in stock.  This did turn out to be the best plan, as the aftermarket radio is better than the factory one anyway. I contacted Audiosource and they were very helpful with the return and understood my frustration.  Clearly with Taurus and Sables being big selling cars this must have happened to someone else before. So, the moral of the story is, if you want to install this kit, or any aftermarket radio in a 2000-2007 Taurus or Sable, you will need an extension cable that goes from the in-dash unit all the way to the trunk!  This cable is not even available from Amazon unless you purchase a Metra dash kit.  Then it is included with the kit.  A small notation in the application description would have saved me a lot of time and shipping costs (both ways).  In the Product Description, they notate that the factory radio must have a CD button.  One more notation stating that Taurus' and Sables need an extra cable would have saved me time and frustration.  I have since put another radio in my own Taurus using a Metra kit and an aftermarket radio from Amazon.  It is like \\""Knuckle Bruiser\\"" says; unless you are pretty handy, it might make sense to have it professionally installed.  Hope this helps someone out there.  Good Luck!",3,1

The price was good.  It looked like it would be more protective of the enclosed device.  But it couldn't hold my WD Elements Portable HD and USB cable nicely.  It's so tight that the zipper was broken once.  I had to back up and tried to zip again very carefully.  I could barely zip the case.

"This little gadget has an amazing potential to be terrific.  MP3 player, digital voice recorder, AND USB flash memory in one handy little package. WOW! Unfortunately, it doesn't quite live up to its claims. I bought it primarily for the digital voice recorder and file transfer features. I wanted to record singing rehearsals so I could play them back in the car, and carry working project files back and forth to the office. This gadget sounded like it could cover all the bases and has 1 GB of storage to boot.  Now the downside: First, the built-in microphone has no level adjustment or gain control and is easily overloaded. It handles quiet conversation or lecture well, but even my quartet overloaded the mic from 15 feet away. We won't even talk about my 100-member chorus and overload. Second, when the device is connected to your PC, you can set up subfolders and categorize your music, data and voice files. But, from the device menu, you can't access those subfolders. So now I'm in the car and I want to listen to a specific set of learning files that are grouped in a subfolder, but I can't access them. I just have to thumb my way through 93 other files and still find that they aren't all together. It will accept your name for some files, but not for all. If it doesn't like the name you pick, it just calls it Track 12 (I have 4 of those now). Next, the battery life is not nearly what they are claiming. I've been using industrial strength batteries and am only getting about 5 hours of use out of each one. The plastic casing has a nice textured feel to it, and the buttons are easily placed for use. I've only had mine a month though, and already the big \\""on/off\\"" button on the top is being uncooperative. I bought this unit from \\""digitalharbor\\"", and while they have been okay in the response department, they don't seem equipped to answer my operational questions, like why can't I access those subfolders and why the on/off button is already crapping out. I guess I shouldn't have expected such amazing features for just over $100. But I was so hopeful. I'm trying to return the device to the seller, since it's not doing what I need it to do. I think I'll keep looking at mini disc.",3,1
I have one and there is a very loud turn on pop when I start my car.  It'll take another $60 to buy components to create a delay that will stop this.  You're think they would design that into their product.,3,2
Not bad,3,2
"After about 3 months, the LED numbers on the clock stopped displaying. Bought for my daughter as a Christmas gift. Not pleased.",3,2
"Just received this item. Extremely fast shipping by \\""buygpsnow.\\"" The item is made by i-cap a Korean company. It is well made, appears to be a quality product. It has \\""i-cap\\"" printed on top and not \\""tomtom\\"" as shown in one of the product pictures.     The visor appears to slightly improve viewing in bright sunlight, I would say it is 75% better. The bottom third still appears faded out. I am rating it 3 stars. Overall it is easier to read the screen with it than without.",3,1
The case was defective so I could not use it.  Otherwise it looked fantastic.  Just as described with a pocket for accessories.  Too bad I couldn't use it.,3,2
"I purchased this \\""Hyundai\\"" product because I didn't want to pay dealer price but wanted all the features the car salesman said it would provide(I know, car salemen often speak with forked-tongue).  Anyway, my iPod does play music through my car radio using this cable. However, it does not display the song info on the car radio display as I was told it would. Thinking my older iPod might not be able to support this feature, I tried my daughter's newer iPod. It did not display the music either. Wrote to Hyundai customer support and they referred me to the dealer(yes, the one that lied/mislead about several features besides this one when the leased me the car). So, don't know whether to blame the car, the Hyundai cable or my Ipod(s). Just frustrated with the whole mess and not happy with Hyundai(their car and their cable).",3,2
I am reviewing the ipod nano 5th generation that I recently bought. It said it was in great condition. I think that it was in good condition. When I was ordering accessories for it I found out that I was really sent a Ipod nano 4th generation. Little unhappy. I think next time when I order I will diffently be more careful.,3,1
"Bright light.  It appears to always have power available at the output so as soon as you plug in your device the transfer starts.  The button seems to be used only to control the light.  I wish it had some way to tell you if it still had a charge or not - 1 star lost for that.  The indicator light only lights during the re-charge process.  It is able to transfer power up to 1 amp to my Kindles as well as low demand  devices without complaint.  Having no way of telling if the bank is still near full or empty is bad.<br /><br />Slipping an inexpensive 7/8\\"" plastic or rubber cap from your local hardware over the end will keep dirt out of the contacts and stop false activation.<br /><br />When charging my Kindle keyboard (which wants to charge at .85A), it can supply only .70A at 4.20V which is a large voltage drop for a power bank.  Some tablets like my ASUS limit their charging current to a 4.75V input, so it would be a slow charging process.  For phones with small displays or MP3 players it should charge fine.",3,2
"The protector was easy to apply and stays relatively clean with a minimum of fuss.  But it seems like it adds a bit of blur to the display, although it is hard to tell.  (When you boot up the Kindle Fire it has a bit of blur to it to begin with).",3,1
"This charger does what it says, and it comes with a paper for a 3 year extended warranty. However, I prefer products that actually work for longer than a month before they break. After less than a month of light use, one of the adjustable teeth broke when I was removing a battery. Not worth going through an RMA to get a new one. The previous one I had worked for over a year and I gave it to a friend when i got my new HTC Rezound. However it will work with any phone battery.",3,2
its ok,3,1
it moves back and forth and that is about it. I think it could have been designed a little better.,3,1
"It's a good case, i love the fact it really does look like stitch but there are a couple things i would change. The button at the top of the Ipod touch 4th gen. that locks it, you can't push with this case on. It doesn't make contact with it and doesn't line up properly to be able to push so you have to flip the top of the case off to hit it. The second thing is the ears, I like that they move and can be made to look like they are tucked behind his head but the holes don't line up properly to make the ears flat and stay in place, which is a downer but the fact that i love stitch is worth the couple faults in the design.",3,2
its small and sleek looking but when I began using it  it played the music only for 10 seconds and then it stopped.  It kept doing that every time I turned it on.  There are no instructions and no trouble shooting  guidelines. So its a waste of good money I thought but  decided to call the number they give and almost immediately  I got an email response that the unit should be charged and  how to do it.  They should have added that to their instructions.,3,2
I can't keep a station on for any length of time. I have to mess with it thru the whole walk. The head piece is suppose to fit right on the back of your neck and i can't get the thing to stay in my ears. The piece in back hits the back of my head and then that in turn moves the ear pieces. If i had it to do over?? No i wouldn't get this one.,3,2
Easy to install and easy to use.<br /><br />I drive for a lot of night time and HUD makes safer to driving so I can only focus on road.<br />It shows things not show up in original display like as battery voltage or fuel consumption.<br /><br />I did not know it is km unit not imperial unit.<br />Should Look on before buy.,3,1
works ok told it work on all cars from 96 to 2013 it dont would of been nice u have that posted,3,1
"I liked it the first few days i had it, but then while grabbing my ipod out of my back pocket after a week of owning the case the ipod slipped OUT of the case and shattered. I do not recommend this case if you are clumsy or will be keeping the ipod anywhere else besides a purse or more secure area.",3,1
"In theory, this is a cool gadget, but I'm not sure it's worth the money. (I use it for my BB Curve 8900 from T-mobile.) My top 3 \\""LIKES\\"" is that my BB fits snugly in the holster, I can charge other devices using the USB plug, and I can now talk hands-free. My top 4 \\""DISLIKES\\"" is that I have to turn the phone upside down in order for the USB port not to be blocked by the cradle, when I put the phone in the cradle, it sometimes depresses the voice dial button, the FM Transmitter is weak so if I want to listen to my music on my phone I will just use the speakerphone option, and because my cigarette lighter is low, I tend to bump into it when I shift the car into park. I will still continue using it, but it wasn't as awesome as I hoped it would be.",3,1
I'm not good in selecting a car audio receiver... But Alpine is a good brand. I liked it. The output was not up to my expectation but still it is a good one. I may have to get one amplifier to get a better output...<br /><br />Anyone can give me a better info.,3,1
"It's a great cover and does what it's supposed to, but the reason I gave 3 stars is because it seems to triple the weight of the nook and attracts hair like crazy, when hair and dust gets on it it become a chore just to get off the case.",3,1
I have this mounted on my windshield with clear line of sight about 4 feet off the ground.  It can't pickup stations that come in clear with my stock antenna on my other car.  It picks up local stations fine.,3,1
"The case itself met the description in the ad and the price was certainly right, but one disappointment was the color was more hot pink than red as advertised. The major default, however, was there is no cutaway in the back for the on-off switch for the device. It takes quite a bit of pressure to turn it on and off.",3,2
Never really used it.  Found a very acceptable app for phone for $15.,3,2
"It's okay, but the nook is only secured by this little piece of elastic which kinda blocks with the page number or the menu button. Other than that, it works well.",3,1
Hard plastic cases just don't provide much protection in the case of being dropped.<br />So if protection is what your after I would choose differently,3,1
"Chargers were fine...other stuff a little cheap..but for the price charged it was ok..Arrived in new packaging, and on time",3,1
The product functions fine.  But the extra size on the phone is a little much to keep in your pocket.,3,1
"I purchased this case for my Nook Glowlight because I love the color purple. While the page does say it is not compatible with the Glowlight, I wanted to try it out anyway because it was such a good price. The case is very nice and sturdy and the Glowlight does fit in it quite nicely. However, it has stained the back and corners of my Nook purple and the stains will not come off. I'm not sure if this is why it is not recommended for the Glowlight but I am a little disappointed. While I like the look and feel of the case, I can't give it five stars due to the fact that it has permanently stained my Nook.",3,1
"Alright, for five dollars including shipping, this really is a bangin' deal. This cost less than the micro SD card I put in it.<br /><br />That said, you get what you pay for. There really is no shuffle feature, so songs are played in the order they're synced to it. Every single time. The headphone jack is so stiff I'd thought I'd broken it the first time I plugged into it. Also, any time you turn it off, it goes beck to the very first song in your library, so you have to skip aaaaaall the way back down to whatever song you had been listening to.<br /><br />There are better alternatives, but for the price, whatever.",3,1
"the holders on each side are not wide enough to hold an iphone with a cover on it.  (well, at least my iPhone 5).  So those two slots were unusable to me.",3,1
"It doesn’t really matter which “brand” name you see this little dashboard cam listed under here on Amazon.com, they are all the same. You get a front camera with a small LCD screen to view the action and see the menu options, a rear view camera, USB cord, Power cord, suction cup and adhesive attachments and a remote control.<br /><br />The cables are plenty long enough to set this up and hide the cables in a standard car (not sure about an SUV).<br /><br />The cameras are cheap plastic units that feel like they could be easily broken. They do rotate so that you can try to get the best angle/view.<br /><br />The instructions are pretty much useless as is the remote control. I found the remote only works to turn the unit off/on, which you do not need since the unit starts with your car and shuts off after the car power turns off.<br /><br />There is NO infrared (IR) ability, even though it is advertised as such.<br /><br />There is supposedly an internal battery, if there is it lasts less then 5 minutes.<br /><br />The unit will not overwrite the files as the instructions say. You actually have to swap out, reformat or empty your SD card when it is full. Otherwise the unit will get in a loop of turning on and immediately turning off (which makes it hard to format the card in the unit at that point.<br /><br />My rear camera kept falling off the window. Adhesive stuck to the window but the camera came away from the adhesive. Had to glue the camera to the adhesive that was still on the window to get it to stay.<br /><br />This does not record in HD. Video quality is often spotty and unfocused. I have had clear results and very bad results with choppy footage and frozen frames.<br /><br />I have mine set for 5 min record time but it will not record more than 1 minute at a time no matter what I do. Sometimes it does not even record at all (missing footage when I go back and review my drive).<br /><br />For the price I will keep it until it dies completely. While I have not had to rely on the footage for any accidents it has captured some of the idiots out there on the highways.<br /><br />It also messes with your radio reception.",3,2
"This player is well built and sounds great (I'd say above average) when using quality headphones.  However, the water-proof headphones that are included with the unit are the worst sounding headphones I've ever heard.They have no bass whatsoever and sound weak and very tinny.  I've never purchased waterproof headphones before this so I don't know if this poor audio quality is typical of the type or not.  Again the MP3 player itself is solid but only sounds good with other headsets.",3,2
"When I first got this case, I loved it- it looked even better than it did on the computer. The color is cute and girly, and it looks great on the iPod. However, I had a screen protector on, and it wouldn't fit on it with the protector on. I had to take it off, cut it, and then I was able to get it on (after a bit of a hussle.)   Also, the top coat is actually clear, and you can see through it the case on the inside, so it doesn't look that great up close. But it's hard to notice unless you're REALLY looking at it.   I haven't dropped my iPod (yet) so I don't know how well it can hold up to that. Hopefully well.  Overall, it was a good buy for the price I guess, just because of the cute design. All my friends love it.",3,1
I ended up purchasing another cover because this one doesn't allow the ipod to fit into docks.,3,2
It was what it looked like on the web site.  However it did not fit the item for which it was purchased.  It was used for another item which made it a usable item for me.,3,2
"I purchased this item 2 months ago and overall I like it but it definitely needs improvement.  The video quality is great and the sound pick up is good also.  The manual is small text and makes for difficult reading.  The details of each feature is not the greatest and I pretty much had to explore on my own into each feature.  It states it has 4 LED lights surrounding the front of the camera for night vision but does not turn on automatically (which I thought it did) and the manual makes no mention of how to turn them (by battery?)  I searched around the product and cannot find any switch or anything of the sort to make these lights turn on so I'm dependent on my headlights and highway lighting.  If anyone knows how to get these lights to turn on, I would appreciate being notified.<br /><br />Thank you.",3,1
"I purchased this charger to replace a lost charger for a Coby MID7048 tablet.  When I plugged the charger into the tablet and the wall it began charging.  When I checked the charger a couple of hours later, it was not working.  Found an internal circuit breaker switch and reset it.  It began working again.  Checked a couple of hours later. . . .same problem.  Needed reset.  After resetting, it finally charged the battery and has been working since, as long as you don't let the tablet battery run down too low.  Apparently a very low battery will pull too much current for the charger and cause the internal circuit breaker to trip.  Resetting gets everything going again and once the battery gets enough charge, the charger will keep going until the battery is fully charged.",3,2
The case is great! I would have loved to know ahead of time that the skin and screen protector was for a Kobo 3 because if i did i would have never order it. There was no info about it being for a Kobo 3.,3,1
This case doesn't stay on very well. With that being said I like the color but is just doesn't stay on the Ipod,3,2
"The clear hard case did not fit the sansa fuse. The armband is okay, the price is great for the product",3,1
"This is just what I was looking for. The FM transmitter works well and the clear station is great to have, all you have to do is put the phone in the dock and start playing your music, you only have to use the head phone cable to use the hands free option (as I often have people in the car with me I profer to use a blue tooth head set for calls anyway). The suction cup holds very well it is still stuck even after releasing the tention, the only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the arm that holds the dock is two short and the swivel doesn't swivel quite enough, in my car there isn't room for the head phone cable between the top of the phone and the windshield unless you turn it sideways, and it won't turn quite far enough to the side to really be perfectly adjusted for me. These are really minor issues how ever and may not be a problem at all in another car. If your looking for a dock for your car and don't have an aux Jack this is nearly perfect!<br /><br />This is an edit after having this for awhile the transmitter still works ok but the Hands free functions no longer work and the holder has gotten loose on the phone great idea pore quality I would still buy again for my uses unless something better comes along that does what this does.",3,1
Still not sure how to turn on the shuffle,3,1
I have the Galaxy S4 with an otterbox case on it. The phone barely fits in the armband. It also looks ridiculous on my arm because phone+case+armband is way bigger than my arm. The quality of the armband case that holds the phone isn't very good. It already ripped after using it a couple times.,3,2
"My Xoom fits in the case pretty well, but not perfectly. It's a slightly lopsided when its sitting upright which makes the power button not easily accessible. The cutout for the front camera isn't even, but doesn't cover the camera, so I guess it is ok. When closed, you can't plug in since the jack is covered with the sleeve. There was a small scruff on the inside of the case when I took it out of the package, but nothing major. I'm happy to have something to keep my Xoom safe, and the magnets on the front flap are nice to keep it closed when moving it. The purple color is really pretty, looks like it does in the picture.<br />Overall, it'll work for what I bought it for (to keep my Xoom safe), so I'm happy with that.But for the price, I think I may have been better off spending a few more dollars and buying from Verizon or Motorola.",3,1
"What I needed: 1-2 charges, something that didn't obsolete all sync cords and stands, easy removal and no additional cords or charging blocks.  So it succeeded in all of these.      This case is a bit of a frankenstein but it does as advertised to a point.    I  get about 1.5 charges  but the ability to charge additional devices might be a plus for some.   It is quite thick but isn't uncomfortable despite it's appearance. I do not keep my phone in it all the time but as needed.  I like using the Apple stand/cradles for my morning alarm clock so this design helped.   Easily removed if you are using solely as a backup charging cradle in your bag.    Charging iPhone to 100% is remarkably quick.    The buttons on the back are hopelessly designed and are always activated.  I used a hot glue gun to create a recess ring to prevent discharge or random charging. This is a tool to me  so I don't care much about this D.I.Y. addition so that now I can be worry free about the buttons.  These buttons really need a redesign and are the main drawback.   The light has marginal use suppose but add a bottle opener and you have a great gadget!",3,1
You get what you pay for with this case. It's soft case is flimsy.  It covers the I-Pod but doesn't offer much durability.,3,2
"If you are an audiophile person and love crispy sound of musics ...this device is not for you period ! you will hear sound distortion if you go high volume .....BUT ....don't take me wrong ! not bad for use as external TV speaker , or just for listening to the news or regular radio musics through your iPhone, iPad,etc....<br /><br />For those who gave 5 stars , please don't mislead people with good reviews  if you don't nothing about audio technology !<br />My final word , yes , it is OK device , for the price . ....Am I happy ? So, So, ....I'm an audiophile person !<br /><br />Conclusion : 3 stars",3,1
"What you pay for is what you get. This case doesn't have a charging opening which is very inconvenient because you have to remove the case to plug the iPod in. It's very soft and comes off pretty easily but still holds the iPod. I think it fits the iPod well and it looks great! The material is too soft to hold the iPod securely in place like the other brands. I've been using it for a couple of months and I like it. The case makes the iPod shape square and its easier to hold. Plus, it looks like a thinner version of the iPhone 4s.",3,1
"gets 5 stars for battery life and fit, with that being said it gets 1 star for the charger.<br /><br />I wouldgive 5 stars if they fixed the charger problem I outline below.<br />I have purchased 2 of these about a month apart and both have technical issues inside the charger. the first one melted the charger badly tge first time I plugged it in to charge the battery in the car. I opened it up and discovered there was a resistor in the circuit to limit current and voltage but they soldered the output wire directly to the 12 volt source side of the resistor and the resistor essentially wasnt there. when I desoldered the wire and resoldered it to the output side of the resistor it fixed the overcurrent problem which could have damaged my car and my radio.<br /><br />if you dont mod the charger you will not be able to charge and transmit at the same time because when the radio gets overvolted it goes into a protect mode where it will still receive but not transmit.",3,2
"Case is O.K., sturdy and protective, but for some reason case changes color and gives blue streaks and gloss over screen of ipod when out in sun, or when ipod gets warm, very strange and blocks view of ipod screen with distortion of pictures or video, this is very annoying, cheaply made. Easy to take off, just slide fingernail along groove and pops off easily, if you don't mind blue streak distortion, and just use for music, it's fine, but if you look and lots of pics and videos, it's very annoying. 2 to 3 star rating",3,1
Camera worked for about 5 mins. Then stopped alltogether.,3,2
"I have used different laminate films and this one is just &#34;ok&#34;. I thought it was a bit more difficult to handle and apply without leaving air bubble or dust for some, but that may just be my nerves. Trying to align the camera holes and get it perfectly centered is my hang-up.<br />Its sort of thick and seem more frosted than others I have used so I would not necessarily go with this one again.",3,1
"It is just okay in my book, therefore; I do not rally have a whole lot to talk about it.",3,2
When i got it i was really happy it was perfect. Then one day I was taking it off and one of the pieces snapped. I would say to get it as long as you will keep it on for a long time.,3,1
"I ordered this product mainly for the additional a/c wall charger. Sad to say it would only stay connected to my Kindle Fire if it were \\""braced\\"" into it somehow, just right, otherwise it would fall out.<br /> I was very disappointed as I bought it for travel and the first trip I went on and needed it, was when I found this out.<br /> I have since purchased an extra charger from Kindle for less than $20.<br /> The cover was nice, and I gave this to someone that needed it. He loved it. I wanted a different style.<br /> I have not used the  car charger or ear buds.<br /> The anti glare protector works fine.<br /> For the price if the a/c charger had worked, it would have been a great buy!",3,1
I have a creative Zen that I use to listen to DRM protected audible books from the library.  It is on it's last leg so I went to purchase another and found out they don't make it anymore.  I Saw this product creative Zen x-fi w 32 gb that was only $20 more than the creative Zen 16 th so I got it.  I am unable to get it to work w DRM protected files and the seller wasn't able to assist me nor was overdrive software people. So I will be using this for my Amazon audible library and music only.  I purchase a 4 gb creative Zen for my DRM protected files. Not the best solution but I wasn't able to justify spending another $200 plus and the seller didn't offer to exchange it.,3,2
My son like..,3,1
"Overall the product did as advertised, but, unfortunatly the only way it will boot up is when the power cord is plugged in. While booting up I have to uplug the power at the right moment to boot to N2A.",3,1
My expectations were a bit higher from this product..specially after reading its reviews online. I didnt find the product easy to use. Sound quality is ok. Also it gets discharged when in use even though its connected to charging.,3,1
Cool thing  But the quality isn't so great  silicones are nice  screen protectors too  like the FM tuner  Thank y'all  Peace.,3,1
"The skin is a little too snug on my 30GB Vision M.  That causes the buttons to become inoperable unless I \\""loosen\\"" the skin a bit.  I have gotten used to this.

"They are my 3 rd set of speakers, the connection into radio always wallows out over time sun and miles. They are fine for the job. Decent enough sound and long as I don't go over 75 hear them good enough. Just don expect them to last forever. I live in Fl & have got rained on plenty of time. IMO great for the $$.",3,1
I had to send this back because it did not stay affixed to my ipod.  The seller wa quick to respond and tried earnestly to make it right.  It was very inexpensive as well.,3,2
Works fine for around 8 months.... Bought many of them so no problem at all.  Good price for what you get.,3,1

"I really like this case however, i used the screen protector that came with it and the case edges get underneath the protector and pull up the edges. I went out and got a magic shield and i have had no more issues.",3,1
this is the third time I am buying it. It has a life of roughly 6 months to 8 months. the spring mechanism on the clip is likely to get worned out in above time frame. its handy and not that expensive except for the unreasonable shipping charge by the seller.<br />neither say yes nor no for this product !,3,2
"The cover is nice, but the art decal is very meh.  The screen protector is great because glares give me a headache but it really reduces the touch sensitivity, which is too bad.",3,1

"The Good:<br /><br />I received my Kobo Touch for Christmas.  I enjoy reading with my it.  The screen is terrific for reading, even in our bright Florida sunshine, and the font size, line spacing and margins very customizable to accommodate nearly every reader's needs.  It was a little complicated getting books from my local library on it, but once I figured that out, I soldiered on.<br /><br />The unit has a nice feel and I like the narrow width, thin case and light weight ... easy for my somewhat smallish hands.  Battery life is great - I read an hour or two a day, and the battery lasts well over one month.  Touch-screen response was initially slower than I would have thought for turning pages, but hey, I got used to that, and also figured out how to touch the screen \\""just right\\"" to bring up the menu.  All-in-all, I was content with the unit.<br /><br />Then it froze up - after two months of reading, mostly in the comfort of an air-conditioned house.  I get it.  Out of millions of units sold, a few will have problems.  I just happened to get one that had a problem.  I contacted customer service and was given an RMA and an address to send in the faulty unit.  I immediately sent it to them.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />I had contacted \\""customer care\\"".  Several times.  After sending e-mails that got no response, I called.  I was told they couldn't look up my status in real time, but they would flag the agent who was tracking my unit.  I got a response from the agent saying it usually takes two to three weeks for turnaround, but he would escalate my query.<br /><br />After a few go-arounds like this, a brand-new unit arrived at my door at the four-week mark.  Better, Kobo provided a software upgrade, and the slowness has disappeared.  I don't know if it is because I am used to touching the screen the right way, but bringing up the menu seems to have improved as well.<br /><br />In Summary:<br /><br />Am I happy?  Not particularly, but I'll get over it.  Do I like myKobo.  Definitely yes. Will I keep it?  My wife's Kobo has been flawless since day one.  I expect I received one with a problem, but am willing to forgive.  I will keep my Kobo and enjoy its benefits.",3,1
"I bought these buttons... at walmart... for cheaper. I pain $1.57 for the exact same thing. No wait or shipping to worry about, so. Just thought I'd put that out there.",3,1
"I got this for $20  and really thought it was not so bad at first!  the speaker is ok (for quiet areas)  like chillin in the tub or while reading the paper-  the build is not the worst, it is pretty solid for the cost-<br />drag and drop mp3 makes it very easy to load songs on, it really is not that bad for the price and it does work-<br />the problem i have is the battery last from 1-3 hours max!!!  it only lasted 3 hours the first day, since then it makes it about 1-2 hours on full 8 hour charge!!!!  even for $20  I cant deal with that.  even 4 hours i would be ok with but 1 or 2???  as for the big pause/play button- I dont mind that at all, it makes it quick and painless to pause when i must-  and even the button layout is no biggy.  if it wasn't for the battery time i would keep this, but it will be returned because of that. (btw-i got it at shopko)",3,2
The E-LV Protection Armor Defender case is excellent to keeping the I pod for protection. I rated it a three because you have to take it out of the belt clip to use the ear bud which really defeats the purpose. You cannot access the port for charging either. Other then that overall worth the money.,3,1
They are very cute & colorful & have a nice texture BUT they have to be removed in order to charge the iPod.  The slot on the bottom is not wide enough for the plug.  This company shipped quickly.,3,1
the case is great protection for my garmin. It needs to be bigger to include the power cord.  The price was right $.99 so I can't complain.,3,1
I like the product but it doenst even have micro usb chord with it so hassle,3,1
"the unit Is well built ,good Bass,midrange and highs, great battery life, a little pricey for the unit",3,1
doesn't give me everthing my garmin has,3,1
Screen protectors are a must for tablets but can be tricky to apply. Caseen's is no exception. It is a good thing the company included several sheets because I ruined one trying to apply it. The second time it worked and is pretty permanent. It does not obscure or dull the display at all. The included compact stylus was a nice touch but it eventually broke and I bought a slim stylus to replace it.,3,1
"Didn't work with the Bose dock which was the whole reason I ordered this! Argh! It came on time but that doesn't help me at all! >.< Intermittently charges stuff but cord that goes into your phone is not snug so charging is a bit of hit and miss... Going to try for my money back, this is B.S. :(",3,2
"When I saw this combo package I was elated. Finally an item that has a sync/charge cable with the dock extender included. I carefully read the review and decided to give it a shot.   It appeared everything worked except for video pass thru but that was the main reason for my purchase. Needless to say, I had to return the item and continue my search.  Oh well.",3,1
"I can see the arc light from the tip, but I can still feel the shock.<br />Its liked being kicked from the arm down the body.",3,1
"Everything seems not bad, BUT - you can see rainbow when your phone locked, no any rainbow during using phone, and cant rid off couplle bubles, especially near fron camera, there were bubles even on e second film, but if you will look by price really not bad",3,2
"These bulbs look great and run much cooler than can-com &#34;error-free&#34; LED's with built-in resistors.  The color is very nice.  It's a bright white without any yellow cast, but it doesn't look trashy artificial bluish or purplish.  For applications where the bulbs are lit continuously (daytime running lights, fog lights, corner markers, etc), &#34;error-free&#34; LED's will overheat, fail, and likely cause damage to your car's bulb holders.  These are a much better choice for such applications.  I did have one of these bulbs fail after approximately 100 hours of continuous use, but it failed safely without overheating or damaging my car.  The amazon seller was very helpful in replacing the bulb for me.",3,1
"Not easy to use. Simple design that doesn't catch or clip the device secure enough. My device fell on my toddler's legs a handful of times in the month that I've had this. It may be my fault, but not easy to tell if it's securely on or not. Feels like, if handled roughly, the mount can easily break- which would be easy when you're tired, stressed, and have a screaming/kicking two year old. If or when it does, I'll probably look into something else.",3,1
Typical made offshore product. Chrome part of horn housing is plastic. Mount strip is very light weight. Does have a decent sound and a low price. Purchased for and istalled on a UTV.,3,1
Gave it away.  Couldn't get the channels I wanted.,3,2
"Love the color!  Unfortunately, my Kindle was about 1/2 inch shorter than the area between the corner straps.  Therefore, I was not able to turn it sideways without fear of falling out of the case.  I eventually had to stop using it and buy a different type.  Had it been the right size, I'm sure I would have loved it.  Disappointed.",3,2
It worked ok the first time I used it on my motorcycle.  Then it became intermittant. I opened it up and found a cold solder joint on the board and repaired it.  Now it's ok.,3,2
"The price is good and the product work.... but the product is very bad (bad sound, very slow...)",3,2
"this is a nice product but not nearly as loud 'n clear as it's made out to be in the video commercial.  For the price tho, it'll do.",3,1
"Broke after a month, half of it just snapped apart. It looks cute but isn't very practical. i wouldn't buy this again",3,2
"Good product, it works as advertised. It does lose connection from time to time, I have to restart it and it continues to work.",3,1
"Bought for 8 year old girl.  Color was great, very thick rubber offers good protection and nice texture for good grip.<br />Only complaint is the shape does not allow for easy use in a docking station.",3,1
"I love this device its great sound quality, i was disappointed that there were no directions included with my device. Sometimes the screen does not come on and it doesnt go do to 879 station which is the blank station in my area. Other than that it works pretty well.",3,1
"its cute and all but its not worth the money. the case doesnt wrap around enough and will easily come off. if you drop it, the case will come off and your itouch will probably be scratched",3,2
"Got to improve antenna on my BaoFeng UV-82, & it did give minor improvement (on VHF), but not an appreciable difference on UHF. I had heard the stock UV-82 antenna was a big improvement over the UV-5 antennas which this is typically recommended for.",3,1
It's nice speaker but it's not high volume With I exept,3,1
"Unit works just fine and the sound quality is o.k. for the price of the unit however, the charging portion does not hold iPhones or iPads that are not in cases so that is my main complaint with the product.  All of our devices have cases so it basically was not what I had hoped for.  Difficult to return also as it came from China.  People were very good about reducing the price so ended up keeping it.",3,1
I like this bearcat scanner but not sure if I programmed it the right way because so much of the transmission cuts out.,3,1
The product works fine and you get more in the box than you actually expect (adaptors for any kind of iPod). The sound quality is good but it does not recharge my nano 3rd generation. Also. The cables are long and lay around. Relatively ugly next to the nice design of the Phillips CD player.,3,1
It is a good thing for your ipod but it will brake after about 50-60 days.... it starts with these tears then it just comes apart.... if you like to use it to watch stuff i do not know what to tell you then because the kikstand broke in like 40 days....,3,2
GOOD PRODUCT. WONT LAST LONG BUT STILL HELPS. KINDA EXPENSIVE FOR THIN SHEETS OF PLASTIC THAT WITH TIME START TO FALL. QUICK SHIPPING,3,1
"After trying many diffrent ways to install this product, I finally figured that this unit is not really meant to be a universal fit.  It just would not fit.      To be fair, the customer service was very helpful.  After looking at the enclosed catalog, I told them part number for the proper kit to my truck, and they promptly sent it out.    It was an almost Happy Ending, except that they also wanted me to send back the old kit.  Postage cost me as much as the item itself.      What a waste, but is done.",3,2
"Got this through Apple's Antennagate program.  Everything fits and functions well except after 3 weeks of use, I've noticed that the thin area of rubber located at the bottom of phone(front-side right below home button) where the charging input resides has started to loosen up and sag a little. I predicted this would happen when I realized there was no extra support there.    If they fix this, it's a five star rating.     Hopefully it doesn't get worse but it probably will... it's rubber.",3,2
"There is a little buzzing sound, but you will barely notice it when using the aux",3,1
The footrest to very large so it is difficult to fit under a desk.  The 'easy' adjustments require picking it up to reset it.  I also felt for the price it was rather cheap plastic.,3,2
"awsome amp lots of power for the size,put good speakers with this amp like polk and be amazed.does not run hot at all stays cool to the touch.the onley problem i have with this amp is i have lost my fm signal,havent found a way to fix it.my have to remove it to get my fm back,it a shame it a good little amp just doesnt work good if you listen to fm.",3,1
"Had this product not arrived defective, i might have liked it.  it had all the features i wanted plus more but i had to return it.  i opted not to get another.  also, seller was slow to respond to my request.  but i did finally get my money back.",3,2
"this was an ok purchase, their is a lot of feed back when using the phone, the speaker works ok, but sometimes the road sound drowns out the speaker",3,1
"I have owned this product for close to two months.  When I bought it, I also got one for my husband.  His works as advertised and is an awesome transmitter/holder.  Mine on the other hand broke about a week after I received it.  This may have been an oversight as my husband's like I said is in prime condition.  The cable that goes from the transmitter to the charging port in the IPod came loose at the IPod end to where the protective sleeve would come off.  I had been to use it despite this for a good while, even taped it on, then three of the wires came loose with the sleeve and it was down for the count.  I am going to purchase another due to my husband's success with his.  If I have a second one come apart on me, I'll update this post with a down-graded rating.",3,1
"Definitely cheap but good enough for me. Quality is ok, functions well as nook protector. You can tell it is a knockoff if you has original nook real case protector but eh.",3,1
i like the huge screen and the games it came with. but the other things. like the radio and the T.V. it not work properly. or work at all.,3,2
"I purchased this bundle for my 13 y/o son (along with an iPod Touch 4g).  After around 2 weeks, the AC adapter that was included broke (one of the male connectors broke off).  My son used the adapter frequently because the battery would drain after a while from playing 3D games.  He also plugged it into several different outlets as he moved around the house.  With that being said, I still would've expected to get more than a couple of weeks of use out of it.  Everything else seems to be working fine though.",3,2
"Item(x2) was purchased for a Baofeng 5r. Issues----there is indeed a gap, a real and bothersome one. Also, the antenna works roughly the same as the stock ones. Frankly, the only noticeable increase in range was on UHF.....with admittedly limited testing.",3,1
The shipping took forever to get here. When the ears are down it covers the battery. The sleep and volume button is very hard to push and the ears come off but other than that the case is great and supper adorable.,3,1
"It works - but the drawer sticks a lot when you push the button - decent price no real problems, just inconvenience from time to time",3,1
"I am sure that this is great for a iphone, but I tried to use on my Evo, Galaxy S2 and neither fit.",3,2
"First off, i think this is a good case. it is very sturdy and i think that it would take a lot to break. Also, i like the idea of a built in screen protector. There are however, a few problems with it. First of all, it is extremely difficult to remove the case once you get it on, so its not optimal for use with speakers. That ties into my second point in that it is a little too bulky. Third is the built in screen protector. I like this idea, but the plastic used is too soft and scratches very easily. Fourth is the outer rubber casing. it tends to slip off of the sides. And finally, the buttons take a lot of pressure to press. So overall, i like it, but it is not without it's problems.",3,1
lost one of the channels on my radio but it was a preset I never use. When I'm at home witch is about 25 miles from the good sized city i only can seek to the 2 strongest signals but in town i get all of the stations. Kinda so so I like the look but I'm going to keep the stock antenna for when i go on trips because i don't enjoy listening to static.,3,1
"I got this case, and was happy that it did fit my Ipod snugly - no problem of anything falling out.  It does indeed stand on its own as the picture describes.  The back loop has a snap to make it easy to place on your belt.  The docking part is not hindered, and the screen is able to adjust to the light very well.      However, I did have some cons:    1) The sound was more muffled when in the sleeve  2) The opening for the speaker/headphone was very close to the hole, and I had to keep pushing the leather aside to get to it.  3) The red contrast stitching was not made very well - I had loose stitches which was quite unattractive.  4) Though it is leather, the design could definitely be more sleek.  Also, the leather edges make it a bit more difficult to touch right at the edge of the Ipod screen.    It's still pretty decent for the price, but I'll be sending mine back for something else.",3,2
"I bought this case for my daughter for her iPod touch 3G and it fit okay, but it came already missing 1 inch of paint on the back of the cover.  For what we paid, it was fine as you know teens will switch out their cases repeatedly.  Love the design!",3,2
"I bought this to inspire me to work out more, because it's hard for me to work out without music. I didn't use it many times and it's already falling apart. It was kind of a waste of money.",3,2
"Its OK. It doesnt look as nice when I recieved it. It was TOO glttery & the glitter kept coming off the case. In my opinion, I would NOT buy this again.",3,2
"The speakers themselves are fine. However, I made a mistake. I ordered these as they are shallow mount, and standard depth 6X9's won't fit in the door panels of my 2001 Sebring Convertible. The problem is that the Chrysler Premium Infinity sound system is set up to handle 2 ohm speakers...these are 4 ohm. Oops.",3,1
"The case is great. Just what I wanted: protection for my Kindle. The screen protector didn't quite work out how I wanted. I tried to put in on without any think to smooth out potential bubbles and tons of them formed. So I tried to take it off and it got dirty. I tried to wash it and it got dirtier. I can't use it. I love the case, had trouble with the screen protector.",3,1
"I like that the player is simple with a small screen so the battery doesn't get burned out and player lasts for a long time.  I like that it is powered by a AAA battery so I can just replace the battery instead of waiting for the player to charge.  I just have some rechargeable AAA batteries that I can use over and over.  I also like that it plugs directly into the USB so you don't have to keep track of a cord.  What I don't like, the swivel for putting it on a lanyard or something is very fragile and will break.  I also don't like the toggle switch thing on the side.  I find it annoying and tedious to use.  IRulu makes a different type of player that doesn't have that feature so I've bought some of those and am happy.  so 3 stars for the USB and AAA batteries, but don't like the toggle switch thing or the fragile loop for attaching it to a lanyard.",3,1
OK for the price.  But a little jiggly on rough roads.  I ended up buying a Bracketron.  That seems to be more stable because it has a very short arm.,3,1
Quite good looking case.<br />the corners are very good for protection.<br />the silicone case fits perfectly but the hard plastic case pops out sometimes.,3,1
I have noticed that it pulls in more satellites than my other gps receivers.  I use it for my Nobeltec navigation software and it goes start up quickly.,3,1
"When i first got this case, it was amazing. It was a tight fit for my ipod 5th gen. But after awhile it became a little easier. The holster is great and i dont even feel like it will even fall off my waist as i jump or workout. The stand on the holster is sturdier than the stand on the case itself since you can adjust it and move it on the holster but the case just snaps to place. My friend thought it was a snap on case and put it in the wrong way. It is a slide-in case! So, trying to remove the ipod which was completely stuck, the holster broke. After using the case stand and keeping the ipod case on to at least have some protection, the stand cracked in half and the screws keeping it in wont stay in place. Although it does lock down very smoothly. Ive had various cases which still scratched the back of my ipod or left it dirty or dirt/dust got through. And when i open the back its just as i had put it in there really. I would feel completely safe if i dropped my ipod, holster and all. But now that im missing the front, i still feel safer than it being naked, but id rather not drop it. I want to get another case because i need the holster clip for consistent use. If thats what your looking for then go ahead. The case looks very nice almost as if i had a phone. Also the stylus, is not so great. I have a screen protector and it barely even works on the screen. Although the case does not pick up the screen protector in any way.",3,1
"Hi,     I brought this after a lot of R&D on Amazon and other sites. The manufacturer has posted wrong photo for the film. Beware, if you are looking for a protective film that fully covers the back side of the iphone, then do not buy this. As, this one just covers a portion vertically.",3,2
"it took me forever to find a NookColor case i liked. I must have spent a half hour in BN looking for one. I knew i wanted something that closed because i didn't want to risk having the case open inside my purse endangering my nook. I searched on Amazon, from the pics i loved this one. It had a clasp, loved the patent leather look and the red wasn't too bold but red enough to make a statement. Here's what i don't like about it: It smells really bad, like chemicals. I was hoping that the smell would go away after a couple of days but it's been weeks now and i can still smell it. The color isn't a pure red, it has some black specks in it. The clasp is awkwardly placed on the back of the cover, should be on the front.     It'll do the job until Kate Spade comes out with her new line of NookColor cases.",3,2
"This radio looks great and plays CDs and DVDs great, but there is a reason I gave it only 3 stars. For one the extremely thin owner's manual is not helpful. Boss does not tell the customer how to use every feature of this radio, which I find extremely irritating because of the amount of features this radio has. The features they do tell the customers about is no more than a paragraph long, details are non-existant. I have purchased many car radios in the past and never had such a hard of a time working a radio as I am having with this one.<br /><br />Also, the USB port does not work with mp3 players like I was under the impression it did. Another feature that was not talked about in the owner's manual. I finally was able to connect the mp3 player to the Aux in port, but it sounds awful. I can't hear the music playing unless I turn the volume up to at least 24, but the feedback sounds so terrible I just want to unplug the mp3 player and listen to the CD player.<br /><br />Another thing that drove me absolutely insane with this radio was the TV tuner. The person who installed this radio and I sat for the LONGEST time trying to figure out why the TV tuner wasn't working. I finally called customer service and they told me I had to purchase separately the antenna for it. It made me mad that this antenna didn't come with the radio and I wasn't made aware of this through the manual, but what made it worst was when Boss told me that they don't sell to the public and had not a clue who sold it. After going on a wild goose chase looking for this antenna, I still do not have it because I was told Boss hasn't made that specific antenna available to their distributors.<br /><br />I have to warn anyone who is interested in this radio about their customer service. They are the most rude, non helpful, non caring people I have ever had to deal with. Since I couldn't get help through the user manual, I tried getting it through customer service. I asked the technical support, which is only one person, about various problems I was having and they made me feel as if I was a nuisance to them. The guy told me anything just to get me off the phone. I felt so terrible after getting off the phone with them, so I had my friend call and see if he would get a different response. Boss ended up telling him \\""it's in the manual\\"" and hanging up in his face. These people on customer service are not pleasant to deal with, so be prepared.<br /><br />The screen is crystal clear, perfect for the DVDs. But it does take longer than usual to load a CD. I would say that the DVD player and the attractive design are the only things this radio has going for it. The other features are such a headache to have to deal with that it'll just make a person say \\""Forget it, I'm done trying to get this to work.\\""ut various problems I was having and they made me feel as if I was a nuisance to them.

"Perhaps this works for others, me it did not.  However, may not be the tracker itself but the H2O Wireless Smart SIM does not.  Called H2O and they said the SIM would not work as its for phone only.  Seems poorly made as battery didn't seat properly and the battery door latch is not good at all.  I ended up getting the XGPS TK109B.... quality is so much better.  May weigh more but out of the two the TK109B is better in my opinion.<br />Primary use was for tracking Quadcopter or Model Aviation",3,2
"I originally purchased the M490 adapter back in late October 2013 to output stuff from my HTC One to TVs and displays with HDMI input. According to my research, the M490 and the M500 are essentially the same item with one exception - the connector to the phone. The M490 has the standard microUSB connector that fits most phones, while the M500 has the special MHL connector that's found on phones like the HTC Rezound. The item title which clearly mentioned M490 combined with the item photos showing the standard microUSB connector convinced me that I am indeed buying the M490.<br /><br />Alas, that was not to be. I received the M500 adapter from the seller, Seller1ON1. It arrived well-packaged and looks brand new, but it was the wrong item and the connector just physically did not fit the HTC One. I tested it on my HTC Rezound, and while the physical connector fit the phone, I couldn't get it to display on the TV. The custom ROM I was running at the time on the Rezound didn't seem to have stable MHL support, so that  might not be the adapter's fault. In any case, I bought the adapter for my HTC One, so I arranged a RMA return. Seller1ON1 was responsive and courteous, but to my disappointment, the replacement was yet another M500 - even after I explicitly explained to them over multiple emails the situation and that the M490 is what's needed.<br /><br />After two rounds of RMA with prepaid shipping, Seller1ON1 emailed back saying the product is unavailable and they will arrange for a full refund. I was very disappointed, but I was also very impressed by Seller1ON1's customer service.",3,1
"This is my second colossus amp first one did not work and the warranty stickers were ripped so it was not covered.  I currently have it in a shop in California for repairs,  i live in chicago. I thought i might have ripped them when i bolted on carpet.  So when this 2014 model came first thing I did was open the box carefully flip the amp and saw the stickers, they were both ripped.  So i wired it up and tested it. It was worked fine. What upsets me that the stickers were ripped so no warranty.  This a different vendor that I used.  I owed five hifoncis amps  and first 3 great, 4th defective with torn seals, 5th good with torn seals. I've learned from sending out that 4th amp that parts are really hard to get for hifonics. The California shop is charging me 340 dollars to repair it when parts are available.",3,2
"It works great, but I should have checked the type of batteries it uses.  Hearing aid batteries do not last long.  I am often on the phone an hour or more at a time and at that rate, these don't last more than a day or two.  Replacement batteries were hard to find.  Once I bought a fresh set, it worked perfect...for a day or two.  I just ordered a pack of 60 batteries and will use this until I figure out a better solution.  It was very easy to set up with standard cordess handset and headset.  Sound is perfect.",3,1
"I bought for a project but when it came it would not work, your better off reading and than re-reading about the item",3,2
"This case is truly beautiful! but the jewels come off very easily and once you put the case on its very hard to take off. only buy this for its beauty, don't buy it as an all around case because if it drops it will be ruined. and this case does not fit on most iHomes. it is beautiful but dont be fooled it breaks easily...",3,2
"I bought this to replace an old unit I loved.  I was surprised it had so many features for such a cheap item.  The screen allows you to see the song title and it has most of the usual features like shuffle etc.  The earbuds broke the first day, but no big deal.  I like the fact that it takes an SD card.  I could load a couple cards with songs and switch them out as needed.  I did notice that it wouldn't recognize my card when I turned it on.  I would have to eject the card and re-insert it every time I turned on the player.  I didn't like that you had to reset the features (shuffle etc.) every time you turned it on.  It produced good sound quality.  I have since replaced it with on that is better.  Its not a bad deal overall, but if you're used to an iPod or nice brand named product, you will probably be disappointed.",3,1
"The case was great, but I didn't receive the fishbone keychain.  This came as a disappointment since my daughter could've really used it, but I guess that's what happens when you order the cheaper items.",3,1

"I bought this to read current books.  It is well built and easy to use - BUT - if you want to read current Authors, it's very difficult to find these books in .txt or the old .pdf format that isn't the new Adobe Digital Ebook!!!  Adobe Digital Ebook won't work with the Jetbook.<br />I also find the screen darker than shown in the picture!!  It's more brown.<br />I ended up getting the Sony PRS 505 and now am very happy!!<br />For strictly reading Best Sellers and New Released books - this doesn't make it!!!<br />If you want to read classics (Moby Dick, Huckleberry Finn, etc.) than this will work!!<br />I suggest before you buy any ebook reader, check out the websites and see what books are offered in the formats for each reader!!!<br />No matter which Ebook you purchase, the prices are the best at Amazon.com!!!",3,1
"The leather description for this case is a bit inaccurate, as I believe only the interior is leather. If the exterior is actually leather, it certainly doesn't bear a resemblance to any leather I've ever seen, touched, or smelled, and being the child of a shoe store owner, I've seen plenty of leather in my day.    As another reviewer stated, there are no pockets. Additionally, it would have been nice for the part holding the nook to be a bit more secure - a holster-style pocket, let's say, rather than just the elastic cushioned loops.    However, it does have its merits:    1. It's very comfortable for lefties to use. With the flip-up top, it permits easy ambidextrous access to the nook's buttons.  2. I really like the fact that the power button is covered: it reduces the risk of it accidentally being pressed.  3. The integrated stand is potentially quite useful, depending on one's needs. I have a PDF cookbook loaded, for example, and can consult recipes on-screen while in the kitchen.  4. The price is very reasonable.  5. It seems well-made: the magnet closures are strong.    It's functional. It does what I need it to do, which is to protect my e-reader from casual wear and tear.",3,1
"It works great with great picture, but the power port in the camera easily broke after a few weeks. I was trying to get it off the winshield and the power port just fell apart. I recommend it if you DON'T TOUCH it after installed",3,2

"I bought this because it was the only yellow silicone case I could find.  There were no reviews anywhere so I was uncertain of the quality.  I have another skin from one of the more popular sellers and it fits the nook perfectly.  This one fits like the picture shows.  It leaves a little bit of the nook exposed.  It is also very smooth.  My other skin is more skid resistant.  This skin is so smooth it is almost slippery and does not stay propped up like my other one.<br /><br />Bottom line is that this skin feel more like soft plastic than silicone, is very slick but does stay on and protects my nook.  I will probably order a different one and toss this one.",3,1
"for the price I  paid it did not meet my expectations , because right before that I had just got another (no Eznsmart )<br /> from a different site for  a lot less money , but I did not installed cause the installer said it was too  big for my car so  I order the Eznsmart  which gave me trouble from the first day and I gave the other unit to my friend and he installed in his car (i got that one for 129 his looks a lot more better than mine and it does more and it has better sound , well Eznsmart is not bad but not the raving it got at amazon if you think i paid 240 and got something that makes you feel that any time soon it will give you trouble , it gets stuck a lot , it is not for a lot touching and does not play my videos but all & all it's okay so far<br />Harry",3,2
It was inexspensive. contained only inductance and capacitance. Measurements do not go high enough  and the use of a usb cable to power one is a ridiculus idea. Leads too short and no instruction material. Other meters are nothing more than multimeters with a little inductunce and capacitance throw in..Had to buy another meter to get higher measurements but this meter is okay for what it is. If you only deal with low to medium measurements buy this one. can battery operate it too which i lihe.,3,2
"I'm giving this a three stars, one off because it doesn't work with my ear buds with a mic, second star off because they are low, even with two ear phones with out mics they aren't good. i dont use these since they dont meet what i expected. hope my review helps.",3,2

"I bought this for my new Kindle. I made the mistake of buying it for the DX when that is not the model I have, but that is ok it has lots of room. I also put on a silicone sleeve to protect it so the extra room helps with that (I highly recommend getting on of those). My problem with it is the interior. I wanted something that would protect my screen from getting scratched. The interior of this case is anything but soft. It feels a bit scratchy. I am very disappointed with the interior.I had to get a soft cloth to put on the screen when it is in the case. As soon as I find a new case this one will be history!",3,1
Ok!,3,1
It breaks really easily. Ugh.,3,2
"Well made, right color, fits like a glove - so overall the product is a 4/5.  But it only provides back support with no provision for protection of front of device. Had expected something different.",3,1
"I bought this despite the reviews which mentioned it was inadequate for music due to the speakers not providing enough volume, I mainly bought it for the ability to take phone calls.<br /><br />What I found was quite the contrary, music is fine, no you cant hear clearly while at high speeds above 70mph due to wind noise, but its nice for background especially when tooling around town or stopped at a light.<br /><br />My issue on the other hand is that you can not hear people that you are calling (and I would assume transmitting to other riders though I havent used it for that yet) unless you are basically stopped, and even then over the idle of my bike (r1 with exhaust, so I cant imagine a Harley etc being better) its still hard to hear them. This is not a problem with the speakers, it is a problem with the unit not providing enough volume power to the speakers, if it would go louder this would be solved.<br /><br />To my surprise people I tried to speak to on the phone, later told me they could here me loud and clear even when I was on the highway, so at least the microphone seems to work well and block out unwanted noises.<br /><br />Since the unit uses an 1/8\\"" jack, I can easily try using in earstyle earbuds, and this solved all of the problems with not being able to hear music OR people while riding at ANY speed, but there is one caveat to this, no microphone so people cant hear me. Okay it seemed like an easy solution I found the original ear buds that came with my blackberry which have a microphone built inline and decided I would wire them up to the unit, after spending some time doing this, I was dissapointed to think that there must be a problem with my old set from my blackberry, as it did not work right.<br /><br />So I ordered [[ASIN:B004X2623U PureGear 36322PURE Pure Beats Premium Stereo Headset with In-Line Microphone]] waited to get them and spent even more time setting these up in my helmet, then I found that its wasn't either pairs of earbuds, it was that these types of earbud/mics are for some reason not compatible with the gsi unit...the mic setup is not configured the same or something like that...<br /><br />As a last resort I decided I would try to splice an earbud into the OEM speaker/mic setup, but found unfortunately that the wire used on the oem setup is so tiny and thin it could not be spliced with anything else :(<br /><br />Another issue I had was that the clamp which attaches the main unit to the helmet broke with very little force when I was trying to attach it, now I will admit I was a little rough, but if you drop your helmet and it lands wrong you can expect the same amount, very weak design on that - Fortunately GSI must have know this and they also include a adhesive style mount, unfortunately the adhesive wore off after a month and I have had to super glue it twice now.<br /><br />So here I sit, I am not able to use this device for what I intended it for, and its a shame because for the most part it is a good design, if they gave the unit the ability to amplify the volume during pohone/rider conversations I would have been more than happy with it. If they had an optiong for in earspeakers, I would have been happy with that too, but they dont and therefore I am NOT HAPPY.<br /><br />Maybe GSI will contact me and try to make things right, if they do I will certainly update this review.",3,2

"The Zune is no longer being produced and when it was, this stuff wasn't really useful anyway. if you have a usb adapter for your car charger, you don't need a Zune car charger you can just use your sync cable in the car. I had absolutely no use for that FM transmitter because the Zune has a build in radio and gets its signal from the headphones anyway.",3,1
The rubber cover and armband work great. Have used it for a long time and it doesn't give me any trouble when working out. The home charger works and the retractable USB is fantastic. The car charger doesn't work for my 5th Gen Ipod. Still not sure why that is. In any event its still worth buying for the other stuff and maybe the car charger will work for you.,3,1
"My experience with this keyboard as a keyboard is fine, It works as advertised in that aspect.<br /><br />However, as a screen cover, it falls short. The reason it falls short is that when it is in place as a cover (it fits snuggly), any pressure at all will cause it to activate the home key which turns on the tablet and causes battery drain. I will be keeping the keyboard as you can attach it as a back cover in much the same way you would as a screen cover. It doesn't fit quite as snuggly but it does stay attached. For now, that will work for me. But it is not the experience I expected.",3,2
"This cam is very easy to use. You basically just slam a SD card in, suction it to your window, plug it in, and you're ready to roll! I set mine up so it records at 30FPS at 720p and have had a very clear picture. The sound recording is also good quality.    All you need to do to get the videos off the device is either:  A) remove the SD card and insert it into a SD slot on your pc  B) plug the micro usb cord (that is provided)into the device into your pc  C) us the HDMI slot to plug it into your tv or pc.    However you may notice on playback through VLC media player you get a shutter or frame skip every 3 seconds. Simply use windows media player to play the videos and you will not experience this problem.    Also the camera seems to be easily breakable if it is dropped. The plastic used feels cheap and brittle.    ****WARNING****  Product update After a year or so of ownership the camera began to shutoff randomly and not turn on for hours. It also would appear to be recording but the footage was not present on the SD card. I dropped my rating from a 5 to 3.",3,1
"2 out of 3 computers had trouble copying to this device. However my computer at home running Windows 7, had no problem. Once I started using it in the car it worked very well.

"Sometimes I'll plug my phone in and it works fine, other times it kicks back an error etc. I think the wall charger part is fine (which is why I really bought it), but like most fake iPod/iPhone cables, there isn't 100% functionality all the time like there is with the real iPod cable. I have a iPhone 3GS and used this cable with both iOS4 & iOS5 for reference.",3,1
"It's a good case, but I have not used it because of the screen protecter was not well put together. Unfortualy I was shocked to see no directions of any sort other than \\""Step 1\\"" with a circle and the words, \\""please peel off before application\\"" and a sticker with a \\""step 2\\"" with the same phrase on the other side. So I peel off the first and the second was like a price tag sticker, it peeled only partically off and left a sticky residue. This greatly upset me, but next I discovered that the first side was sticky and had collected fingerprints and dust. and as the side was sticky, I was unable to clean it! This is extrememly annoying and irritating. Reviews over Speck products have been great but without an manual over the products, even a quick step by step, would have been nice! I would have expected better from an extablished company. I paid a good sum of hard earned money to get this and I am NOT a satified customer. so if you do get this be careful before you start peeling things off! Also the color was not what I think of red as, it is a weird color.",3,2
"What I like about the camera:  Small and compact  Cost effective  Came pre-set in English with decent defaults  Powered by Mini USB    What I don't like:  Got somewhat hot during my testing at home  The settings are not all retained  WDR cannot be turned off  Silver ring around the lens  Corrupt last recorded video (see below for workaround)    I tested the camera at home and found that the last recorded file always corrupts when you power it off, because the capacitor charge is not long enough, or there is a firmware bug. I have contacted the vendor for a possible newer firmware. The last video corruption, which may be the most important in case of an accident is a huge minus, and is well documented for this model. Lots of people complain about it, and no firmware exists to fix it, yet. I have this workaround for it. Play the video on the device first. This will fix the video headers somehow and makes it playable on the PC. That simple. Don't try to repair it on the computer, and playing with VLC will not work, unless you run it one time in playback in the device.    How to play it in device:  Power on if necessary  Press MODE button on the right until it switches to playback. There are only 3 modes, video recording, photo recording, playback  Use Up/Down buttons on the left to find the last video based on the numbering sequence  Press REC button on the right to play  Power off the device  Eject the MicroSD card  Insert MicroSD into SD card adapter if necessary  Plug in computer card reader slot/USB reader  Open explorer and locate the last file on the last folder  Playback with QuickTime, Windows Media Player/VLC  Optional: Copy to PC for record keeping/evidence or upload to YouTube/Facebook    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  UPDATE2 - 8/29/2014    I have located a different firmware that fixes the corrupt last fine if you search \\""G1W-C_FW.zip\\"" online however this switches the menu to Chinese. To get it to English, press M button twice, scroll down to ABC logo and select English. I tested it and it works.    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  UPDATE3 - 9/9/2014  The motion detection was not reliable, I found gaps in recording, so I had to turn it off. Right now it's on continuous 3 minute record. The last file corrupted has not manifested itself with the new firmware I put, and it seems like all the settings are holding.",3,1
"If you have issues or concerns with sweating with the Nike+ armband systems then consider the iFrogz ibagz as an alternative.  It is water resistant, easy to operate, and your ipod remains completely dry.     The only con is that it must be manipulated for comfort.  I simply tighten the lanyard around my arm and then place the Nike+ Armband over the bag once I've started running to keep it in place.

"Personally, this case was alright. However, the product itself looks a lot more dark colored than what's the image shown. It also turns to a light brownish color in a month or so...the look wasn't so pleasant. This does fit the iPod but doesn't fit it perfectly and can be wobbly when moving your iPod around. I've had this case for a couple of months now, other than a few flaws..it is a decent case even though I feel there are better cases out there. The price is very reasonable, however when I purchased it, it costed me an extra 10 bucks. For the price at this point...I'd say it's worth it.",3,2
"Image is not very sharp.      Camera transmits image with overlay to judge distances with several overlaid lines. With the camera mounted 18\\"" off the ground a red line demarcates position about 2-3 feet away at ground level.  The base is angled about 25 degrees from the camera so if it's mounted on a flat surface above the license plate surround the camera is tilted down at a fixed angle.    If powered by connecting to reverse light in which it will only function in reverse or by a wire controlled by the accessory switch it wouldn't draw down the battery as per previous reviewer's concern.",3,1

"The software is not very intuitive, and does take some fiddling to work out.  But once you figure it out (took me about 30 minutes), it works pretty well.  Data points from track give time, speed, direction and altitude.  I am uncertain of the accuracy, since the altitude is usually showing me 19' under water.  Think I am a slightly better sailor than that (or I can hold my breath for several hours).  I have e-mailed tech support with questions regarding correcting this, but received no response.  Nothing on their website which discusses correcting this.    I shopped for this product, looking for something which I can mark GPS spots with a push of a button (while hoisting the spinnaker during a race).  I also have Velocitek Prostart.  For Prostart ($600) to provide same tracking data, you would have to purchase their software ($50) and a third party software ($100).  In a small dry bag, I keep this in my PFD pocket, next to my whistle.  This device is NOT water proof, they do not even suggest this.  For sailing/tracking purposes, this is a less than $100 solution, which works well for racing or cruising.  Taking pictures with camera, then marking spot with this GPS tracking device works well.    Through the provided software, the files can be converted to KML files, which can be imported and published/shared in Google Earth.  Battery life is decent.  Carries more than 24 hour charge, which lets me charge the night before a race, and toss it in my PFD pocket.  Morning of race, I usually forget stuff like this.     Does have blue tooth transmitter, but this does not work with ipod touch.  Ipod touch does not have drivers to recognize device.  I had high hopes that this was the case, but was not surprised by this.  In theory, one could set this as a GPS receiver to a laptop.  The laptop would stay below, in safer boat environment, and GPS would send data to laptop.  Bit more complex that what I want to support when I go sailing.",3,2

Few flaws to a decent bargain.   The chargers must be drawing a weird amount of current because the touch screens sensitivity differs between normal and hyper. My Zune shows no signs of damage but it's worth noting.   Screen protector doesn't impact sensitivity but shows scratches quite well. Honestly your Zune has a crazy scratch resilientt screen.    Cases are dust collecting pros. Well at least the black one. The clear one was great for basic use.,3,1
"Good product, came on time, product was not damaged or broken so points there. It worked as it should, all the buttons worked and I liked being able to unclip it easily and move around.<br />However, it does not look like the pic, the strap is actually two thinner straps on the top and bottom of the unit, but it held the unit no problem. I found the remote had too much play at the mounting point. And maybe it is just me being me, but when the steering wheel is straightening up on its own, and you have your hand just rubbing on the steering..(dunno if that description explains properly what I mean) It obviously brushes on your hand, obviously, but I did not like it.",3,2

This mount is just great except it isn't strong enough to hold the GPS in one position as stated by another reveiwer.  All it takes is a bit of epoxy type glue and it does it job just fine....just set it in the position you want because that is the permanent position!,3,1

This products works pretty good but just know you are getting what you paid for. This only trouble I had was the screws stripping from the mounting plate. Do not screw and unscrew too much when you are installing.<br /><br />Also for the longest time I could not figure out how to turn the radio transmitter on. It is in the menu under the volume settings. This is not defined in the manual.,3,1

"These cases look exactly like the picture.  They are very cool designs.  They come packaged nicely.  There's even a little cleaning cloth included.  All this for a great price to boot.  I really wanted to give them a better review, however, unless I am completely inept at getting a case on an iTouch, these don't really fit.  You can get three sides on but can't ever really get the fourth corner covered by the lip of the case.  The more I try, the more I'm pressing buttons on the iTouch, feeling like I'm going to crush it.  Again, could just be me not knowing what I'm doing.  Also, because of the struggle to get the case on, I'm starting to rub off the cool patterns on the cases in the corners.  Oh well.  Worth a shot.",3,1

I purchased the MP3 for my teenage son. He had the MP3 for less than a week and the back is pulling apart and the product can't be used without the rubber protective cover.  The product in general is very nice but I am disappointed with the fact it started to come apart in such a short time.,3,2
"This product is great but you have to keep your iPod on a high level of brightness or else you won't be able to see anything in the sun.

"Unfortunately, this version of the nano has limited choices as far as silicone protection. Nearly all of them (including this one) only cover the sides. I'm not sure why none of these manufacturers hadn't considered adding a silicone back to protect the back/clip for those of us who don't use it that way.

"A decent generic case. Was bought very cheap and came with a built in metal stand that works very well. Screen protector was a small piece of plastic that easily caught air bubbles that wouldn't come out, but a screen protecter nontheless. the plastic clip that came with it hooks on to your belt and a small 2 piece disk that goes onto the back of the case hooks onto the clip. The clip itself was flimsy and the disk unscrewed very easily.I could have made a better clip out of duct tape. As for the case itself, I enjoyed the open click wheel, because my old Belkin silicon case covered it and left me with limited mobility. This case was also thicker. If you don't mind the size of the ipod classic already, then you can deal with a case that is about a milimeter or so thicker.",3,2

"I purchased this to add powerlocks/alarm to a Nissan Versa 2009 base model.The overall install went pretty smooth and fit perfectly above the wiring harness under the dash. I installed the antenna right above the rear view mirror and this thing gets great range! In testing I can be parked on the 4th level of a concrete parking garage, and on the bottom level I can set off the alarm with the remote. The alarm is pretty loud and would certainly get attention.<br /><br />The only downside is I can't however get into the programming mode. I follow the directions exactly and it doesn't give me the chirpping to acknowledge that I am in the programming mode. Everything is connected according to the diagram, but it still doesn't work for me. I don't need to get into the settings, but there are some neat features that I would love to access, but can't since it isn't working. That's the only reason I gave this 3 stars. Otherwise it's a great system and does it's job.<br /><br />I would certainly recommend this system as long as you don't need to get into the settings to change anything.",3,1

"I like this product because it is not bulky and can easily be stored anywhere. The only down side is the side pocket isn't quite big enough to hold the cord.

"I got this at Kohl's where it was around $50 after rebate.  I had tried CVS's 7\\"" portable and was unimpressed with the reception using the attached antenna.  But this thing did very well in picking up channels, though it is rather touchy about movement.  It wasn't hard to find a good position, but you don't want to move too much while it is scanning.  With a roof antenna or cable it has exceptional reception and picture.    Battery lasts a while, but it doesn't hold charge.  You pretty much need to recharge it just before using it, if you charge it and then store it for a couple of weeks it will be completely dead.  Plus not being able to remove the battery means if you use it at home you will need to continuously charge the battery which isn't good for longevity.  I would have much preferred being able to remove the battery when it isn't in use.  Especially considering it won't hold channel information for long anyway.    Overall an impressive TV for the price, but I suspect the battery will give out way too soon since it is always draining.  Also once a Li Ion battery goes too low it will not charge again.  So I am concerned that this will quickly lose its portability and end up being a small wired TV.",3,2
"While its not bad for the price, especially when compared to buying one at a brick and mortar store, it just doesn't quite fit all the way in the case.  It is made well enough that I would be happy with the quality except the top of the nook color or the nook tablet sticks out a little past the top of the case.<br /><br />It does fit the original nook with e-ink since its a little smaller than the nook color and nook tablet, I know this because we have all three models.<br /><br />Also the straps at the top push on the volume button and occasionally the power button on the nook color and tablets but do not interfere with any buttons or connectors at all on the original nook e-ink.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because of price and quality of build at a cheap price.  If it had fit properly I would give five stars.",3,1
"Hello Users...    I've been using this product now over a week. At first it was hard to figure out the functions with out a manual. After reading a few comments and playing around with the device I was able to get it to work. Now I'm going to share to you what other haven't.     1. How to setup the device to work with your car radio. Pick any station on the device make sure your radio has the same station as the device so it can link. For sample your device is preset to 87.5 your radio station is at 87.5. Preset is at 87.5 if you car radio has 87.5 use that station; if not pick other stations.    2. I have a 10 speaker system in my car, it gives me a very high pitch sound when it just starts. After a warm up it slowly goes away. My car deck player comes with mp3 player but in a CD disc 700 MB isn't much compares to 4 GB flash drive. One of the reason why I bought this thing.    3. I have tried a 1 GB, 2 GB, 4 GB and 8 GB, they all worked fine, flash drive and SD Cards.    4. For some odd reason it won't play my .wav files so I have to convert them to MP3. Maybe this device plays only MP3 format.    5. The quality isn't excellent as they stated it would be, I gave it an okay rating. Let say I burn the same song on to a CD the output give it more punch or kick on the base level then on the device. My car volume is set at 20 with high output and my device is set at 25 volume to give the kick or the base level I some what needed. If I was to max the device volume to 30 I will blow out the fuse.     6. I have not found way for my cell phone to work with this device. I have a galaxy s cell phone.     7. I don't know if this works who bought this device. My cell phone is able to charge to the device as the music plays using the SD Card and a usb to my cell phone.    My thoughts about this device isn't bad. It does what it stated and the price fits any pockets. The remote works well just a high pitch sound when you do any changes or pressing. I would like the remote to press and hold so it works faster rather keep on pressing the button to change volume or tracks.",3,1
"honestly I don't even know why i bought it, it doesn't like to work",3,2
"I was amazed by the build quality of this speaker.  The only problem its the Bluetooth.  As many others have pointed out, there is a problem with it since it starts stuttering.  Now, to be fair this is what I found so far:  It seems that Android Bluetooth in lollipop by itself have a problem. (Just search on Google), but I also found that there must be an engineering problem in the design of the speaker since it has metal all around it. (Notice that many Bluetooth non-problematic devices are mostly plastic).<br /><br />So, I purchased two to corroborate my findings. (of course, when on sale for $19.99 with code).<br />This its what I found when using it on many of my devices:<br />- On HP Slate 21 - 4.4.2 ... it works fine but it has to be no longer than 3 feet from the device.<br />- On Nexus 5.1.1 - stutters until it stops working<br />- On Galaxy Note 3 - 5.0 - stutters until it stops working<br />- On Acer Iconia - 4.1.2 It works fine<br />- On Acer Memopad - 5.0 - stutters until it stops working<br />- On Nexus 7 - 5.1 - stutters until it stops working<br /><br />(Please notice the Android version for the ones that work fine)<br /><br />So, since I purchase them at such low price point, I got OKRA BTR1 Bluetooth receiver for $12 and connect then via the AUX and all devices connect fine.<br /><br />Please note:  The quality of the item is great and so its the sound.  The only annoying things are the Bluetooth issue (which I think its a hardware and software issue; and the strange voice when powering it on or pairing the device or connecting the AUX.  Otherwise, IMHO I think the device its good and hope that its mostly a lollipop compatibility issue that will be resolved in the near future by Google.",3,1
"I bought this for my husband for when he goes gliding.  Unfortunately there is NO POWER source on a glider plane (that he rents), so I have to return it.  This was saddening because it appeared to be full of helpful needed information for when he flies.",3,1
"This case is super cute and seems to be well made.  I bought this for my 8 yo and she loves it.  I like that it is \\""blingy\\"" without having something like rhinestones (which tend to fall off over time).  HOWEVER, I should have read these reviews better because it is extraordinarily irritating that my daughter can't close the case with the earphones plugged in, or at least the earphones which came with her ipod.  We are on the hunt for earphones which have a plug that goes to the slide, rather than down, but haven't had any luck yet.  Overall we are happy with the look and feel of the case, but wish it had more functionality (maybe they could flip the orientation or make a hole in the bottom?).",3,1
"Good as an additional iPod for special uses, such as use in an automobile. Otherwise, this is a barebones mp3 player, useful only for audio playback. The screen is so small, I can't imagine it being used for video playback.",3,1
"It's a very good device ONLY if it works.<br /><br />For the first couple of weeks, it worked and kept track. After that, the results were good and bad. Sometime it took several hours to return my text message.<br /><br />One good thing is that it has a very good battery life, last about a week. The reason is that it turns off power after few minutes to preserve the battery; then wake up when it receives a text message.<br /><br />Like I said, if it functions good all the time, it will be a good tracking device.",3,1
"This case was advertised for a KOBO ereader cover. When I received it, it is too large for the reader and does not fit. It is made for a larger reader such as a Kindle or Nook.  I liked the cover but it should not be advertised for the KOBO. I am still without a cover for my KOBO. I'm not sure if the seller knew the diminisions of the reader or just thought it would fit without trying the product first.",3,2
"Does the job, but for a simple little silicon case, it's a bit pricey. If you need one, it will work okay.",3,1
"I ordered three \\""GSI Cool Sealed Waterproof Adjustable Armband Bag With Necklace Strap\\"" and I received:<br /><br />* ONE corrected \\""GSI Cool Sealed Waterproof Adjustable Armband Bag With Necklace Strap\\"": HAPPY - That is what I ordered.<br /><br />* TWO substituted bags by seller (NOT \\""GSI Cool Sealed Waterproof Adjustable Armband Bag With Necklace Strap\\""), not easy to seal & bad sound. Is it OK for a seller to substitute the merchandise without asking the buyer?",3,1
not too bad,3,2
Being a DEI installer i always like this peice because it gives customers an inexpensive option to start their car and even provides door unlocking,3,1
like it,3,1
I have been needing one of these for a while and finally got one. The only problem I've had with it is some of the velcro has started to come off from only 3 uses. I had to superglue it on. But it works so I'm ok with it.,3,1
"I received the product in a reasonable amount of time and such, but I had the clip on my hip for only one day and it broke. The plastic is really cheap. I was very disappointed.",3,2
Only problem I saw in it was that the strap and hooks for the strap are a little weak-looking. Definitely pay attention to the wallet while wearing it.,3,1
"Kind of ambivalent about this one. Belkin makes good stuff, and have been happy with other items in their line. There's really nothing to this, and part of the problem is the design of the iPod. Was hoping for a design that would shield the entire thing,including the glass touch screen,  but they aren't out there.  This is like a picture frame without anything to shield the art from the elements. Wanted to do this without getting a bulky water-resist product, and keep dirt out  of ports, etc. . This snaps on quickly, is not slippery, and does afford some degree of protection, mainly against scratches on the back. It's expensive for what one gets, though, and it's usefulness is yet to be determined. More later, if any opinion changes.",3,1
"We purchased this case for a friend of ours, and found out that the quality equals the price.<br />If you are looking for a protective cover for a nook than this is the one to get.",3,1
"Solo disappointed..... It didn't work for me!! :-(  It kept popping/flying out while driving!! NOT GOOD!!  HOWEVER, I<br /><br />It was super fast delivery. It was exactly what I ordered. It just DIDNT work for me. I would recommend this seller, as well as use them again. Just not this particular product.",3,2
"I have had mixed results with the Mareware anti-glare screen.  Anti-glare on your glasses works by placing a coating on your glasses that reduces the the amount of reflected light.  You may perceive some slight color shifts, but for the most part everyone agrees that the anti-glare coating on glasses produces a very positive result.  The Marware reduces glare by randomly scattering incoming light. This scattering approach has the effect of causing mild distortion to what you see on the screen.  The distortion caused by the anti-glare screen is minimal when the Fire is held exactly perpendicular to your line of sight, but even then there is still some small amount of distortion.<br /><br />Also, the screen seems to suffer more distortion from touching than the original Fire screen.  I find myself having to clean the Marware much more frequently than the original Fire screen.<br /><br />I have dyslexia and i'm not certain if i should stay with the Marware anti-glare screen or return to the clear screen.<br /><br />I've also tried removing the anti-glare screen and found that it is not easily removed.<br /><br />3-stars is meant to reflect my ambiguity about the screen.  I must not have read the reviews carefully or i wouldn't have purchased the screen.",3,2
"Works pretty good, but will not automatically pair to my phone, I have to reselect it every time I use it from the phone menu. Also, there is a high pitched whine if the device is in &#34;charge mode&#34;. The way around the noise is to turn the volume all the way up on my phone, and turn it down on the car radio.",3,1
Some of the items that was included in this bundle was okay.  I have a problem with the quality of the rubber casing which do not stay on it is not going to protect the ipod from any damages.,3,2
"I thought I had already reviewed this.  It's not GIANT in size; that's the name of the product. Again, I wish I had read more clearly (I gotta do something about that!).<br /><br />Bought several excellent walkie-talkies for a commercial setting and got these because of complaints that the ones on the radios were a bit small and hard to clip.  Surprise!  They're the same thing.  Fine as a replacement but not an upgrade.",3,1
"This is a nice flexible case, however the design does not show up as much as shown in the picture.",3,2
"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife.  She wanted it primarily for playing CD's and MP3's.  And she wanted something cheap so she didn't have to worry about dropping it, etc. as she planned on using it primarily outdoors.  So in spite of the negative reviews regarding the radio and problems with certain CD's, I bought it because the positive reviews were, well, so very positive.<br /><br />Long story short, my wife loves it!  And guess what, the radio also works great.<br /><br />After having used the boom box for 5 months, my wife reports only 2 negatives.<br /><br />1.  The slider on/off switch is located in the center - makes it easy to leave in the \\""on\\"" position when you think it is in the \\""off\\"" position.  So loss of one star for not putting the off position at one end of the slider switch.  After having gone through 1 set of batteries, she learned to carefully check that the switch is really in the off position.<br /><br />2.  One copied CD stopped playing.  When put into any other CD player, it worked fine.  So I duped the CD and the new copy worked great.  I have to conclude the CD player is weak.  So loss of a second star for a weak CD reader.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great box for the money.  If you can live with taking extra precaution to ensure the switch is in the off position, and can live with the occasional pain of having to dupe a balky CD, I think you will enjoy this boom box.",3,1
"Although the Sony &#34;sound system&#34; looks good, the sound quality isn't that great.  I was looking for good quality FM stereo sound and didn't find it in this radio.",3,1
"Well, I ordered this whole kit because I needed a house charger and only the charger.  Well the home charger in the kit DID NOT work.  The car charger did work but now I have to go out to my car and charge my MP3 player - I live in PA and in the winter this is a real inconvenience.  The other things, I really have no use for.  You should just sell the home charger alone.  This is the first time I have ever been dissatisfied with Amazon.  You guys are usually great.",3,1
"I need to find out what wrong with my card. I can't even run world of tanks Medium graphics all settings with 20fps...<br />My specs are: 3.5ghz i5 .. Z97 gigabyte motherboard, 8gb ddr5ram, and this 750gtx. I can't figure out if it's the card or something else",3,2
It was Okay. did not hold up for my 9 year old but my 13old's looks like it is brand new and she uses her nook every day,3,1
"Easy installation. Nice surface for touchscreen. Quality plastic. The only reason I rate it a average product is because I was surprise that this was not a full clear plastic, it is dark gray which takes away some of the brightness from the screen and it also has a NTSC static TV look. This works great to protect the screen, but you lose some of the screen color quailty.",3,1
"It looks cool, but there is no opening for the charger to plug into it. And it seems to come off a little whenever I take it out of my pocket.",3,1
"The case was ok. The design was cute, but after a while the paint starts to chip off and it looks pretty bad. It does prtect really well though. I dropped my ipod down the stairs and it landed on my hardwood floor. The case fell off, but the ipod didn't break at all. The only other problem is that dirt gets caught under the case and it stains yur screen protector. Make sure you have a screen protector under it if you have a white ipod! the dirt will stain it!",3,2
"Works fine, plays CDs well. Problem is the very loud crashing sounds it makes when it changes the CD. Why does it have to do that? Seems very weird.",3,1
"Pros:<br /><br />Installed easily. It's compact and doesn't seriously obscure the view, no matter where you mount it on the windshield. The GPS is in the mount, not the camera, so you must use the supplied mount if you require the GPS. Since it mounts on the windshield, the GPS has a good location for its antenna, and it seems to work just fine so far. Good range of camera adjustments including ISO(!), white balance, etc. Excellent set of choices of scan rates and resolutions. It mounts and unmounts easily from the GPS base.<br /><br />Mehs:<br /><br />GPS... it's ok. Doesn't know your time zone, but it knows UTC, which is kind of silly. It should at *least* be able to get close, even without map info. Time zones are, more or less, dependent upon longitude. You can set your time zone. 24 hour display mode only as far as I could figure out.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The manual is awful, just awful. Extremely unclear English, many issues not addressed at all (indicator meanings, looping behaviors, what speed limits mean, how to change measurement units, etc.) Learning to run it, and set it, and what the settings do, is mostly a matter of experimenting -- the manual is of little to no assistance. The mount has about 90º of rotational freedom, so if you were planning on mounting it anywhere but right on the windshield for a looking-out view, you can give up that plan right now. It runs crazy hot. I measured 125.5ºF at the center of the unit's display after 20 minutes of recording, with the last five minutes having the LCD display on. I used a Raytek MiniTemp MT6 IR thermal measuring instrument to get the readings.<br /><br />Experience:<br /><br />So far, it seems to work fine. But it's 40º F outside, and the sun wasn't out. I hate to think how hot this thing would get in direct summer sunlight, even with the AC on. This is one review I promise to update both this winter and next summer. Perhaps I'm just worrying too much, and if that's the case, I will be *sure* to come back and say so -- or, if not, I'll mention that as well.<br /><br />I've not brought the card in or tried to read it outside the unit as yet. If and when I do, I'll update that too. Reading all the concerns about the various memory cards has me a bit nervous, but again, that's not based on personal experience so a future update will have to cover that.o come back and say so -- or, if not, I'll mention that as well.<br /><br />I've not brought the card in or tried to read it outside the unit as yet.

"I was looking for a tight fitting, slim case that would offer protection and also fit on my iPod docking stations. Unfortunately the bottom of the cases were too bulky and the connectors of the docks weren't able to go far enough into the iPod for a proper connection.<br /><br />I have a similar case bought about two years ago that is able to fit on my docking stations and I think it's because it doesn't have a strip of material between the plug-in and the ear phone jack. I can't seem to find one now that doesn't have this strip of material and I don't want to have to keep taking the cases off and on every time I dock my iPods.<br /><br />If I didn't use docking stations with my iPods I would have kept these but since I do I had to send them back.",3,2
Didn't work like I wanted. Lots of hum when plugged in.,3,2
Doesn't hold my GPS sturdyly.  If it is in place then it is very easy to use. By itself it is a good product (well built and easy to place anywhere).  The problem is sometimes when I move it to avoid sunlight reflection my GPS would fall off.  When driving that could be dangerous.,3,1
"This is ok for a cover, but it needs better straps to make it work.  Otherwise it is ok for a cover.",3,2
"Its nice to find this item so reasonably priced, but it didn't last very long. A few months later it just stopped charging my iPhone.  I think I'd be inclined to just pay regular price to have a longer lasting product.",3,1
"Nothing wrong w/the product, but overcharged on shipping and it didn't arrive on time.  Should have returned it.",3,2
"Both the wall and car units will charge my Creative Zen V Plus MP3 player and my Garmin Nuvi 750 GPS.  Neither unit will charge my Palm T22 PDA.  So, I am partially satisfied.",3,1
The icons on each button have disappeared in the short time in use.  The OEM supplied remotes/cases with the automobile lasted nearly 10 years!,3,1
Its ok for a cheap Chinese product. Not alot of choices for this product since Microsoft has discontinued it line.,3,2
"This the second micro system I purchased fromTeac. The first I returned because the unit didn't have a headphone jack, which I needed desperately since I used it in an work environment. I purchased the MC-DX32I because it had the same features as the one I returned plus the headphone jack. I do have a couple of minor issues with this model, such as the headphone jack is in the back of the unit instead of in front or on the side. This means every time I want to use my headphone I have to move the unit and since the power jack and antenna jack is on the side, they sometimes dislodge which leads to my other caveat. When the power is either unplugged or dislodged, the unit doesn't save the time or the memory settings which means I have reset everything ALL over again. It also doesnt charge my IPhone, but I resolved that issue. I bought a dockStubz from Cablejive. Other than those issues I would have given this unit 4-5 stars. Especially for the money",3,1
Nice case...hard exterior so it will protect you gps.but it has with one big flaw..it has no room for the cord.,3,1
This itouch case looked very nice but did not last longer than a few months. I would not recommend this product.,3,2
Key for for my wife car very diffcult to program but just need a replacement,3,1
It is the only leather case I have found for the Cowon Audio i9 player.  But it is good.  fits well and protects the player.  I think the hinge piece is a little flimsy and will probably wear out way to soon and at this price that is expensive.<br />I would give it 4 stars but with that flimsy hinge I cut the rating to 3 stars.,3,1
Keep forgetting it's on there wish it had a lanyard,3,1
"I originally bought the cx2300a alarm and the guy said they were out of stock but he would send me the \\""upper model\\"" which is supposedly this version, which doesn't make much sense since the KTMFM is less expensive and has less features. So now I feel like I got screwed out of the better alarm b/c the seller said they were out of stock. The installer I took it to that installs alarms all the time said it was a pain in the ass to install but afterwards everything was working good. Overall the alarm works good, automatic start is nice but I feel I was screwed over by the guy who kept emailing me it was the better version who also by the way is the guy who gave it the 5 star review.",3,1
"product is what I wanted. My complaint about the product is that the clear suction cup looks warped and won't stick to the window. Therefore, makes the product unusable.",3,1
I mean  I gave it 3 because everything was excellent except the one sub rattles for whatever reason,3,1
"The plug does not fit all the way into GPS, but it does say it's charging.For the price, I it's a good buy.",3,1

This works fairly well but I just have to much of a need for power know what you really need b4 you buy a cap,3,1
"What more can you expect from something for this price! Bluetooth enabled makes itunes function great with this speaker, although if you stream music, the bluetooth usually isn't fast enough to transmit the sound without cutting out every once in a while, even with excellent broadband. The only thing I didn't like about this is that it's not made to last. The cord broke after a few months of gentle use and the sound gets distorted easily. Used it a lot when it was new, now I wish I had paid a little extra for something higher quality.",3,1
"i bought this and once i opened it to have this hooked up in my car i was a lil thrown back by the copper wire inside the conduit as it is very thin strands of wire unlike the professional stuff i have seen , the wire itself is close inside the shielding is of a 4 gauge diameter but the copper fibers are very thin unlike the 22-24 gauge strands of higher grade stuff , i will say its powering my 560 watt amp right now but the true test will be when i add my second amp into the mix for my subs..... its doing its job but i am a lil weary of it ....the rest of the kit is of the same quality but its working so i cant complain .",3,1
"The tweeter speaker one of them would not stay in place, so I got to looking at it and there is a spring underneath the speaker it was pushing it out so I took some side cutters and trimmed the spring down a little at a time and it's fixed now",3,1
"I purchased the Skydock from XM for my husband.  We had an itouch and I thought it would be a nice upgrade from his older (self installed) XM radio.       The Skydock has nice features that he loved.  It sounds great, has 30 minutes of rewind and less hook up wires.       He has had issues keeping the radio active, we believe the issue was from a bad connection with the way it mounts.  He had to remove the Skydock and plug it back in often to keep it working.  Doing this while driving is not safe.     XM is allow us to return the radio and we ordered the XM Xpress in it's place.  This has 60 minutes of rewind, but more wires!  Same price $79.99 + tax if you are a subscriber.",3,1
"0-5A adjustable current is very deceptive. The current setting is only a trip point for an overload condition. You cannot adjust the current as a constant current source situation, as a true lab supply would. It should read: \\""0-5A adjustable trip point for an overload condition\\"". The supply is well built and works well as such, but be aware that the current setting is not a current limit, but a overload trip point. The supply cannot be used as a constant current source.",3,2
"Cool item, but looked like it was used when it showed up. Inner packaging was broken and there were a couple of small scratches on the item.",3,2
"I bought they fairing for my k4 gsxr 750 as stated in the description they were not a perfect fit but with arm strength they go together for a pretty good fit, some paint blemishes but over all not bad. For the price I would say they are okay and worked for me, however if you are looking for a perfect flawless fit then they may not be for you.",3,1

"nice key holder that prevent me from sudden discharges, also when I'm in a rug it works well thank you",3,1
"Could not get it to work for my steering wheel controls on a 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited.

"Good battery pack for traveling, but recently something broke inside and it rattles, which worries me, so it stays in home as a backup charger when the energy services get interrupted, and I still fully cycle it each month just for fun.",3,1
Satisfactory. There aren't many cases available that are compatible with a first generation I pod but I am fairly pleased with the protection this case provides. It came when expected. I would order from Everydaysource again.,3,1
Great product but broke very easily within months of purchase,3,1
I got this for my daughter who keeps her phone in a plastic case but needed a carrier for when she is playing.  The phone only fits in this carrying case if you have no other hard or plastic covers on the phone.  Probably will not use it b/c she drops her phone a lot and needs the permanent case kept on.,3,1
"I thought the products would be a bit tougher in nature, but they are not too bad.  They function the way they should.",3,2
I normally would not write a review but in this case where the product description is wrong I felt I needed to.  The case is NOT leather so if you think you are getting a great deal for a leather case that is wrong.  That being said I gave it 3 stars because it is a perfectly good case and works well.  I simply do not like being mislead.,3,1
"Connects fine via blue tooth to a MacBook Pro, but does not work with iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. Otherwise it's fantastic and works exactly as advertised. Didn't have an Android phone to test with. Since they advertise the blue tooth works with smart phones I have to give it 3 stars.",3,1
"Some nice bells and whistles, like volume control and the ability to piggy back the speakers in a chain, but I was VERY DISAPPOINTED with what everyone was raving about with respect to volume.  I bought 2 of these to replace a pair of capsule speakers by iHome.  I had imagined the the volume would be much better on these after reading all the rave reviews.  WRONG!!!  If I had it to do over again, I would have purchased another set of the iHome capsule speakers.  Even though they don't have individual volume control (and who really needs it) they put out a lot more sound than the minis.  (ABOUT 2 TO 1).  And you don't need to piggy back them because they put out so much more sound.  Would highly recommend the capsule speakers made by iHome.",3,1
"I gave three stars because I had to use both of the films. The first one I put it on was not good and with a lot of bubble in it. I tried second one and it's OK but with a tiny bubble. Compare with other one I bought for my surface pro from amFilm, I should say this one is not good. amFilm Premium Screen Protector Film is no bubble at all and thinner.",3,1
This is the only case I could find. Also it was a different color than described. As far as the case go's the rubberized grip is a better feel than the phone itself. I don't feel like the phone is going to slip out of my hand anymore at least.,3,1

Thought it would be different than it actually came. But it's great... Kind of old looking but it works fine.,3,1
"The CaseCrown case for Kobo touch is a pretty decent, albeit bulky case. Although I wanted something slim, I ended up buying it because of it's great price and the fact that I couldn't find any other attractive cases on Amazon. The overall build is pretty decent, and it looks like it provides ample protection for the Kobo. Overall a fairly decent case if you don't mind the added bulk.  One of the greatest aspects of the Kobo touch is how sleek and slim it is. Inside this case, the depth looks like it's nearly doubled. I personally don't really like the extra layers for the card holders/sleeve inside, or the full-body slot for the Kobo touch on the inside. All of it put together adds a lot of bulk to the reader. The clasp also gets in the way a bit when reading. Additionally, my Kobo is a bit off-center when sitting in the case. Although these aren't major flaws, and I am nitpicking a bit, I find myself not using the case most of the time. I had a Sony PRSASC3 for my previous ereader, and I found that to be the best designed cover for ereaders.",3,1

"I purchased two of these 3.5mm stereo 6ft extension cables for use with a headset (w/ microphone) for my PC. The construction quality appears to be solid, and I get good audio quality with the cables, including with the microphone. Since I just received the cables, I cannot say how well they will hold up over time.    The cable insulation is a somewhat stiff PVC that retains its shape a little, but does offer greater durability than your average cable. Expect to spend a little time bending the cable into the shape you want, especially if it has been coiled up for a while.  A braided cloth similar to that used on some of Logitech's newer mice would have been nicer.    The jackets on the connectors are much larger than a standard 3.5mm connector. I am unable to plug two of these into the adjacent microphone and headphone stereo mini-jacks on my PC's sound card. I was forced to use a lower quality extension cable for audio output that has a smaller connector, and was only able to use one of these for the mic input (clear mic input tends to be pickier about cable quality, in my experience). If you need to plug two of these in next to each other, make sure that the two jacks are at least 15mm (~5/8in) apart.    For use with a single jack with ample room on all sides, I would rate these cables 4-stars.",3,1
"More than once by now the item just went off, while in use and having more than 50 % of charge. In this occasion it needs to be restarted, holding the power button for 20-30 ns.",3,2
It only plays mp3s. Not any other file format. So I had file convert all the music files. Shouldn't have to worry about that stuff these days. That should have been in the description.,3,1

Boy what a piece of crap that was. I did resolve a minor issue of the BT not connecting by using A2DP Volume app for Android. It see's the radio everytime and sets everything up automagically including starting up Pandora. Would be nice if the radio wouldn't default to AUX everytime I start the Jeep up after listening to Pandora. Oh well.",3,1
Beware that the corners of your iPod will be exposed. The case will protect the back of the device but that's about it. I returned it and purchased the Kayscase soft shell case.,3,2
"I was so excited when I ordered this product that I forgot it would need electricity.  Must be plugged into an outlet which, in my bathroom, is not close to the toilet paper roll area.",3,2
"My Sirius radio was showing no antenna wiggled wire and got signal for short time , so I bought this as replacement . Turns out radio to base connections worn out moving radio from car to work truck daily . Bought replacement radio",3,2
this is a okay item for my 6 year old but wouldnt reccomed it for a older adlut it only plays half the song on my sd card or it skip while playing the songs&#62;,3,1
"I took a chance on this device based on the product description.  After installation, the device appears to work more or less as advertised - but that in itself is hard to determine exactly since voltage set points are not actually specified. The controller appears to be shipped set for flooded lead/acid batteries. The instructions (such as they are) suggest it is possible to set the device for different battery chemistry, such as gel or AGM. The instructions do not however actually tell you what to do, (it appears there may be missing text on the tiny fan-folded instruction sheet) although there are a couple of computer-style jumpers and a couple of bare wire jumpers on the PC board once you open the controller. Tech support is absolutely no help at all, and trial and error discovery was not practical.  The set points as shipped seem OK for a robust battery - I measured bulk charge voltage of about 14.8 Volts, cutting back to a float value of about 13.7.  I'd hesitate to use this device in an unattended location with a typical light duty RV type deep cycle battery however (mine sits on an older 4DD) since that bulk voltage value held for 2+ hours in warm temperatures could result in excessive electrolyte loss in relatively short time,  and/or warped plates due to heating.  My plan was to use this controller as part of an upgrade for a 12V solar powered lighting system in a shed -- including adding more panels (which I did) adding a 1500 Watt inverter to run some tools (which I did) and changing out the flooded battery for an AGM. In the end I left the flooded battery in place for now. When the 4DD goes EOL I will toss the Instapark controller and buy a name brand with adjustable set points and a new AGM battery.  The controller itself seems reasonably well constructed for the price but ruining even one battery would completely negate the cost difference between the Instapark and, say, an Xantrex or Morningstar unit, both of which I have installed in numerous othersystems and which work flawlessly.",3,1
I like the hands free aspect but I think the volume could be better both speaking and hearing.,3,1
"this zune was like a brick, but ya know I actually did love it very much compared to the brick of an ipod. but heres my review in short of this armband accessory. This thing held my old Zune I had very well. The only issue it that I had to use scissors to cut out the hole where the touchpad thing is because its not cut out. And if it's not cut out, the zune will turn on way too often because of the area where the touchpad is.",3,1
"Item was received in good condition and shipped on time. Very neat and compact. Plays quite loud for its size. If you're expecting \\""Kickin Bass\\"" with the pop up feature then, like me, you will be very disappointed. Bass is almost non-existent with or without the pop up feature. Nevertheless, for the price it is a very neat and handy product.",3,1
Nice product; but I must say the shipping charge was outrageous!!!  This product was sent through USPS and took well over a week to get - so it wasn't a Priority Mail sort of thing and yet cost more than $5.00 in shipping charges for a product that didn't weigh an ounce.  Unbelievable!!!!,3,1
because the charge doesn't last long and the flashlight has no on or off button you just hit it to turn it off and on,3,2
"With any purchase of a knock off you know what you are getting into. The ones I received work for charging but not with the power adapters they came with. Nor work connected to a computer for some odd reason, They work with my cell phones Power Adapter and the Apple Power Adapters but not the ones they came with. Oddly Ill keep them and also recommend them just for having 2 nice extra long cords.",3,1
"It is very strange that this unit does not play music as recorded.  The first second or two of every song is faded in, so when songs start loud, you don't even hear the first notes.  Also, the speaker sound quality is poor, but probably worth the money.  The sd card and usb slots make it well worth the money for a children's boombox.",3,2
"Overall Rating: 3.5/5  PROS:  - Batteries are ultra-cheap.  This light uses three \\""AG3\\"" button batteries and packs of 100 can be found online (on Ebay) for about $2 shipped.  Battery life is advertised at 36 or 72 hours, depending on where you look (36 seems more likely but I haven't used it long enough to confirm).  This equates to practically free energy.  - Very light and portable, flexible neck is a good length and stays in place fairly well.  - Design works well with Tuff-luv flip-style cases, it can be attached to the case when not in use by strapping the neck down with one of the velcro straps.    CONS:  - Single LED is a bit dim and too blue for my liking and it creates a halo effect at the centre of the lighted area.   - Pen cap style clip is a bit flimsy and could do a better job of securing the light.  I would have preferred a clamping clip.",3,1
"I really like the case- I'm a huge fan of zebra, so I was pumped when I found this. The plastic is hard and sturdy, so it does the trick- it also fits the iPod perfectly. Some of the downfalls.... after a while, I've noticed that the print is starting to chip off, so eventually I may end up with just a white cover. And also, it is very difficult to take apart- I don't really need to, but if you ever did want to change it, it is somewhat of a bother to pull apart.",3,1
"The reviews on newegg didn't sound good but anything's worth the penny I paid after rebate.  A lot of people complained that accidentally pressing the answer/end button redials the last called number.  It does not do this to me, when i press that button it beeps & waits for a voice command, for example  I can say \\""Call John Doe Mobile\\"" and it dials the # automatically. You can also say commands like \\""Open Internet Explorer\\"" or \\""Open texting\\"" and it will open those apps on your phone. Its really cool. People also complained that the optional behind-the-ear piece hurts, it doesnt hurt me at all.  It's the first bluetooth 3.0 headset I've seen so I like that, i think 3.0 has a better range of distance so I can finally leave my phone in the bedroom & walk to the kitchen without static.  It is also much louder than my old headset (Jabra BT250v) which is a good thing.  It does have extra long battery life and talk time, and does stay in my ear without the earhook.  The eargel has never fallen off, it is on much tighter than my old headset.  And I have not had the problem of pressing other buttons when I press the answer/end button.<br /><br />My only complaints are that it doesn't vibrate, and I would like it to be a little smaller, but it's still much smaller than my old headset.  Also, it shuts itself off after a few hours, which I guess is ok because when I'm getting a call and turn the headset on it automatically answers the call.<br /><br />**update 6-16-11**<br />even when the volume is all the way down, it's too loud. i have to hold it away from my ear so i might as well be holding a phone",3,1
"I absolutely refused to pay $40 in total to apple just for the usb charger and wall adapter I needed. So I sought this alternative. Well, you get what you pay for.<br /><br />My sister's iPhone 3GS charged just fine with this charger through the wall for a few days, however, its stopped working for her. So now I use it for my Iphone 4S, and it's been charging normally for a few weeks now. However, it does take noticeably longer to charge than with an Apple-made charger. Nothing too big though.<br /><br />One thing: the usb cable will NOT CONNECT YOUR PHONE TO YOUR COMPUTER, regardless of the type of phone you have. It simply won't detect it on your computer, nor will it charge. It must be charged through the wall. Talk about cheap.... well, overall, it's been worth the few dollars I paid for it.",3,2
"It's beautiful and a great deal for the price, BUT you can under no circumstances use a Smart Cover or any kind of cover/case with this sleeve. In fact, I'm not even comfortable using it because it's too snug for my iPad 2 even without a cover.<br /><br />It fits, but you really have to do some stretching and pushing, and that's not cool.<br /><br />It's a real shame, because it's a beautiful little sleeve. I'm keeping it around because maybe future iPads will fit.",3,1
I think I must be doing something wrong because all these reviews are saying it works great! But I've done 2 test and eAch  time a little bit of water got in my case. Any suggestions?,3,1
seems solid. but not as solid as the sirius mount i got off amazon.  the holder doesnt hold the pda as sercurely as i want. i bought this because the real and powered pda i got off ebay has to come from canada.  i need a holder now for the x-mas gift to be fully useful.  akron can do alot better!!!,3,1
"This radio is very strange.  It plays ok, but very sensitive. Sometimes the volume will just go higher, from no touching at all.  The dials go from FM 87 to 190 - ok, but the dialing requires minimal movement for it to change frequency/station.<br />FOR THE PRICE, it DOES THE JOB.  Not recommended if you are seeking a good radio that doesn't chip in and out (with volume).  I only use at nights to give a little background music.",3,2
"I got this to use outdoors at a picnic with about 30 people. I plugged my iPhone in, set the volume to maximum on the phone and the speakers and started playing music, but when everyone started chatting the music was drowned out. People 20 feet away didn't even realize we had music playing. This works great indoors, more than capable of filling my house with sound, but outside the small form factor was no match for an open area.",3,2
"I had no problem charging this and it worked great. My only gripe is that the music on the SD chip doesn't play the songs at random and, worse, it always begins with the very first song. So every time you turn off the unit you must listen to song 1 then song 2 etc.. Of course you can skip ahead, but since even a 4gb sd chip holds thousands of songs chances are you'll never hear most of them.",3,2
"Only four of the five chargers worked on my I phone 4, and none worked on my daugthers I phone 3. The ones that work seem to work well.",3,1
"I was surprised at how thin and light this case was, which isn't always a good thing. It's almost like a skin, except it's made of thin, somewhat hard plastic. Another thing too, is how the design is PAINTED on: therefore, it's very susceptible to getting scratched off or chipped if you're not careful. If you simply want this case for decoration and to protect your iPod's mirrored back from getting scratched, it's OK for that, but otherwise, I'd pass this one up. I accidentally dropped my iPod in a Walmart with this case on and it did very little to protect it. Luckily, my iPod didn't crack or anything, but the upper right corner of it did get chipped so. :/",3,2
"I was happy to find that my nook fit in this case perfectly, and the case itself fit very nicely into my purse. The zipper pouch on the side is big enough for my light and the nook charger, which is awesome because it allows me to keep everything together in one place. The screen protector is nice and easy to use. I ended up taking it off the e-ink screen because the bubbles were too much of a distraction, but I love that I have a screen protector on the bottom touch screen. The hand strap was left out of my order for some reason, but I have no use for it, so I don't mind. The only real complaint I have is that the case smells AWFUL. I can't really describe the smell, I guess the closest thing I can think of is the smell of tires. It actually gives me a light headache. I thought it would go away after a while, but I've had this case for over three months and the smell is just as strong. It made my nook smell so bad I ended up buying a different case, and this case is sitting in a drawer where I don't have to smell it anymore.",3,1
"The radio transmitter workes ok the thing that sucks is that you have to reprogram the thing everytime you restart the car, but the charger came to me borken wont charge ANYTHING!! The cables are cheap and flimsy but, what do you expect with a $20 package. My suggestion would be just pay the extra money and get better quality items.",3,2
"The arm band is well constructed and stays in place during workouts. The only problem is removing the device, the plastic sticks to the screen and makes it very difficult to remove.",3,1
"The ear plugs work well with TF card but the radio function is not that great.  I took it to the gym and tried to get to the station I want.  I could not get it.  Disappointing for that reason.  Then, I used micro SD card and copied my music to it.  The earplugs play well with TF card.  The sound quality is just OK though.  3 stars.",3,2
"Since I am yet to try out an MP3 player that I like as much as I do my Zen Touch 20GB, I decided to try a new battery because the old one is down to maybe 60 minutes of play time (new, it would last 8 hours easily). I received the new battery and started to install it when I noticed the wires were on the opposite side of the plug than on the old one. Yikes, reverse polarity! Not good! I changed them to where they should be, and it works as it should. I played it for about three hours after charging it overnight and it still showed two out of three bars left.    I'm just glad I noticed the polarity issue before plugging it in. I don't know if the Zen has any built-in protection against damage due to reverse polarity, but I'd rather not find out the hard way that it doesn't.    If it hadn't been for the polarity issue, I would have given it four stars since it seems to work as well as the OEM did when it was new.",3,1
Not the best built but not too shabby either. Price could be cheaper for what you get.,3,2
Good amp if you don't need power  barely pushes 2 10'' subs rated at 200rms each  and it gets hot quick,3,1
Quality isnt amazing but its a cool light. No one would be able to tell unless they held it and why would they when its on your bike.,3,1
The case is lightweight and serves its purpose but would have been great if it was a bit larger to fit the cable.,3,1
"I loved the design on the back, however, the front part of the case is very unprotective. Although, if you do happen to purchase this item, i would also buy a screen protector.",3,2
It was ok nook still didn't work but could be a loose connection inside,3,2
"I got these for a friend, who had very poor speakers built in his laptop.  They are easy to pack up, and better than nothing.  but not great, not a lot of volume, and pretty &#34;tinny&#34; sounding.  of course, they were also very low cost.  so there ya go.",3,2
nice but didnt last very long,3,1
I like the size and buttons are easy to find without looking. Can put in arm rest or pocket feels good in had. Only thing is all the buttons do not work. I still find myself using the screen because the is no fuction button or the button won't do function. I would still buy again it's worth having.,3,1
"Love the small size, but not very durable",3,1
"This little multitap works great as a multi tap. I haven't had any problems with it powering any of my DC powered devices. I purchased it explicitly over other similar multipliers because I wanted to use the USB ability to charge my iPhone 4. Unfortunately, while I have tested it with several cables that I know are all good, it does not seem to be able to power the iPhone. It does power other USB devices, however. I ended up scavenging an old charger off of a friend and plugging it into an inverter that I already had plugged into the multiplier. In all other respects this is a fine piece of equipment, especially for the price, but it just didn't fully satisfy my intentions.",3,1
"NOT A 16 GB DEVICE!!!  ONLY 8 GB!!  False advertising, be aware.",3,2
"It protects the screen ok but I couldn't get all of the air bubbles out. And when I snapped a case on, it caused the bubbles to get bigger.",3,2
Works well,3,1
They didn't stick as easily as I had hoped and left a lot of air bubbles and parts around the edge where I touched it wouldn't stay stuck.  Guess I'm glad it's a 6-pack.  Maybe the next one will be better?  I do like that they came with a cleansing cloth.  I'm pretty satisfied over all.,3,1
"the purple one was okay for two weeks and then it wouldnt work unless you moved the phone a certain way and notifies you that its not compatible with the phone, the green one is good so far, but i know it will stop working anytime soon. still 8 dollars for three 10 ft chargers is ok",3,2
"I like that the cord retracts.  It also charges AND syncs my iPod with iTunes, as it should, unlike the previous cord I ordered.  The previous cord only charged the iPod.  However, I think this cord may be defective because it doesn't stay securely connected to the iPod.  I have to keep pushing it back in for it to completely charge.",3,1
"The listing states that the case fits a TomTom VIA 1535TM.  Unfortunately, it does not.  The case is too small.  I called the seller, who simply refunded my money and told me to keep it, as it apparently isn't worth the return postage.<br /><br />So, case doesn't fit my GPS, although it is a decent case of good quality.  Customer service was prompt and polite.",3,2
"It's a good product,just wish it had a better voulme on it. It's low and really doesn't have the headphone<br />port in th right place. All n All I ike it.",3,1
Wasn't the sound i thought it would have. There is really no bass boost in my opinion. Should return it and try another 1.,3,2
"The case took some time to ship.  It has a really smooth feel, but it can slip off very easily. Decent case overall.",3,1
"I received this as a gift.  It's a nice case, but am disappointed since I wanted it for the neckstrap to wear at the gym.  What I got was a wriststrap.  I'll have to contact someone or find something to string it myself.",3,1
"It came a day earlier, Brand new Unopened.The Good things are, the display is very good,Good clarity when listening to music. it have EQ..touch screen response is not to bad.And the pictures look nice tooo. The Bad things are the battery life are not that great.can't picture zoom or rotate, Also it didn't came with HD-HDMI CORD, so i bought it and worked on the TV..But some of the Apps are in chinese also the User Manual..if u are not formiliar with Mp3 players or Ipods it mite be a problem..but its not bad for 40+ bucks if u just need something to use..",3,2
"I bought two at Christmas for my 11 and 13 year old, to replace their ipods.  Overall we have like them.  I will say there is a learning curve and the pictures without light are not good.  The off button seems to be tricky at times too.  To get the player to turn off.  So overall good for the price.",3,1
For what it cost...what can you brag on...I know this stuff costs and arm and a leg in retail stores. But the quality of this stuff was about what you would expect. The plastic cover that came with this kit..when I removed the separating tabs left a glue film on  the cover which made it immediately unusable..go figure? 3 stars for nothing special.,3,2
"I don't use it much, but it does it's job",3,1
"This item is super cheap, but does what you need it to do. I ordered 2, one came in fine condition except for a scratched screen, the other had a scratched screen and a USB port that was moving inside. This product is so flimsy, I was able to disassemble it and repair it myself (whole thing is held together with 1 screw)! Nothing a little JB Weld couldn't glue in place, now it works fine. The downside to this product is that it doesn't want to stay put within the cigarette jack, so it resets a lot. Also, every time you turn your car off, it resets back to station 87.5 FM and song #1- kinda annoying. The remote is unneccessary. I'm sure this product won't last long, but for only paying $4, who cares!",3,1
Works just as good as Apple but doesn't fit the newest Otterbox cases.,3,1
i mean its not all that for the price i paided. it looks awsome in person its fashionable and its a pretty good case to show off to your friends and family. the big downside about this product was it broke in 10 minutes! I MEAN LITTERALY write when i got it the kickstand started to get weak and wabaly as if it were used by some one else. whenever you try to clip the kickstand back in its place it just comes back out no matter what! but dont get me wrong the kickstand really came in handy for alot of things like youtube videos and tv showes or movies on your ipod but i just wasnt really that satisfied!!!!!!,3,1
Did not work but seller did promise to refund my money without the necessity of returning the merchandise.,3,2
The player breaks inside to easily and the charge does not last very long.,3,2
Great Product,3,1
"The case i bought and recieved was COMPLETELY different from the picture. for my case, the eyes are bigger, the inside of the case isnt as protective, i got the wrong stylis pen, the ears were different, and the feet are different. i do not really mind these changes, however, i would rather have the ipod case that is in the picture then the one that was sent to me.",3,2
"I got this to replace my Lightspeed Pro-Flight 2/C with worn ear pads.    Pros:  Handy features: Folds two ways, cellphone and audio player inputs, slim microphone, talk through and peak level protection, lightweight. Good quality construction.    Con:  The headset attenuation was not sufficient for my somewhat noisier cockpit. It needed more clamping pressure. Gel ear pads would probably improve it. As with most headsets the ANR attenuation has a limited frequency range - not best for my case.     I recommend this headset for most aircraft but not for noisier cockpits.",3,1
the only  problem is that the magnet is not strong enougth to keep it close that a big problem with me,3,1
"Well, it does what is says- protect the Zen. It fits well and all the buttons are accessible. My problems with it is: the color is WAY off. I bought the blue one thinking it was going look like the picture (cerulean blue) but instead, this thing was NAVY. Second, it feels cheap-y, like some kind of cheap plastic, and the armband and belt attachments are U-G-L-Y and look cheap as well. I just wont use the armband or belt hook. I kept it because it was only 12 dollars and I wanted something to protect my Zen, so it will do. But there are better ones out there!!",3,1
For a lower priced portable speaker I have no complaints.  It holds it's battery charge and has decent sound. I mainly use it in the car and it is good for that.,3,1
"Bought this for a Kobo Touch e-reader.  The form is nice and keeps it padded and safe but I'm not too keen on the faux suede, it leaves patterns from handling like any suede/faux suede that isn't very fine.  If this was nylon on the outside it'd be perfect.",3,1
Lasted about 1 year but slowly the rubber came off.,3,2
The corner did not snap together. Other than that it was ok other than the huge bow so it didn't fit in my pocket amazingly but its ok.,3,2
This product works alright. audio quality is lacking and sounds a bit like an AM station depending on the location of the receiver. Check to make sure you don't have alot of radio stations in the 106.9 to 107.9 range before buying because if you do it will cause even more problems.,3,1
Bought these cute penguin skin covers for an iPod Touch. Some of them stay on well and a couple of them are loose around the sides.,3,1
"This little speaker has good sound for it's size and it has some good features : voice prompts, mic, rechargeability, compatibility, bluetooth, radio.<br /><br />l like using it, but it has some quirks:<br />- It uses the same buttons for volume and track selection.  Sometimes I accidentally change tracks when I just wanted to adjust the volume.<br />- The volume down and back track button points up and the volume up and track forward button points dowm.<br />- It doesn't stay paired, but at least it repairs automatically when I turn it on if it is in bluetooth mode.<br /><br />Discounted sample provided for review.",3,1
"It came with all the right things, stylus, screen protector and cloth. The screen protector is really difficult to put on, and it feels tacky when you slide your fingers over the screen. The case fits nicely, and doesn't make your iPod look much bigger, but after a few weeks of having it, I realized that a little chunk of it had fallen out in the side where it connects. I hadn't dropped it at all, so I am very confused on where that came from. Then I dropped the iPod, and it protected and bounced nicely and I didn't see any cracks in it. A few days later though, I realized there was a thin crack by the hole for the front camera, and now I can put my finger underneath that crack. It doesn't seem like the drop made the crack, but who knows? I won't be buying this case again.",3,1
"I have just bought my MH 230R 2 way radio from LLc Amazon.com.  The radio is perfect but there is only one little problem with the belt clips (both) they are factory defective as it's impossible to lock the radios to the clip. I carefully examined the clips and noticed that they are not broken.  So, on Dec.3rd. I wrote to the e-mail address (giantintl@callcenter.com) as shown at the back of the package as the address to be contacted in case of using the warranty. I just wanted to know for what address I could send them (the belt clips) back to be replaced and for my disappointment, I haven't got any response from Giant Int'l so far...! I see this as a lack of compromise from the maker.",3,2
"The unit now works, but it was about a two hour effort to get it to work on Windows 7.  The drivers are ancient that come with it, and I had to do a lot of digging around on the manafacturers website and try different settings in Win 7 before I finally got it to work.  Understanding that... the instructions are vague as well!  Here we are in 2010 and the instructions look like something you would get with a toy in a fast-food kids meal!",3,2
mounts broke right away I used Velcro after but thanks anyway,3,1
Quick shipping.  The mounting holes are extremely small. Had a hard time finding screws to fit. But overall satisfied.,3,1
I had one of these which I bought about 2 years ago. I noticed that the fake leather started to peel a few months ago. I bought it only for about $10. Now the same thing costs only $4 plus $2 shipping.<br /><br />I knew that I was gonna get the same thing. I ordered it because I hate looking at my Nook cover with one of its corner peeling.,3,2
"This is very convenient for small spills, vomit, or urine spots.  It cleans as well as our large Hoover upright steam cleaner.  However, we have had this only about 6 months and the plastic is cracked and one large piece is missing.  No one remembers dropping it or anything so it is apparently quite fragile.  Also, when vacuuming up liquid from a spill, sometimes the dirty liquid sprays out the air vent on the side even when the tank is almost empty. That is pretty gross, but since it is so cheap and works well, I would recommend it ... just consider it to be a yearly purchase.",3,1
Worked for 1.5 years... no longer functional.,3,2
"it seems very protected in there, but it is somewhat difficult to get the wheel to work under the rubber",3,1
"I brought this Walkman because the one I had, fell and  broke. I was also  going to use for my mom to help her hearing. There was a study that showed if hearing impaired people (people who are losing their hearing) don't continue to stimulate their hearing, they will lose it<br /><br /> at a rapid rate. So that got me to thinking about my 90 y/o mom, who is almost deaf and refusing hearing aids.  She also has dementia, which has worsened along with her hearing.  Well it dawned on me that the way the ossicles work in the ear, they vibrate when exposed to sound.  If they are not stimulated, they will sclerose or stiffen, and no longer be able to vibrate and transmit sound.  So, I would bring my Walkman and head phones and play music for her, usually with a heavy bass percussion and turn it up loud enough for her to hear. Lo and behold, in about a week of doing this, she was hearing me better and seemed more engaged.  She didn't seem to care what music it was. One day I dropped my Walkman and it would not play.<br /><br /> I had to buy a new one, so I saw this Sony at a good price. It looked pretty sleek and also had AM. My former Walkman only had FM.  It also had skip protection which is great when you are exercising, while listening.  Was delivered from the company very quickly, so no problem there.  The company gets 5 stars.<br />The product gets the 3 stars because the radio is hard to tune and the volume is not loud enough. The buttons are digital and my former Walkman was dial. The max volume on the Sony is what was mid range for my former Walkman.  Oh well, live and learn. All in all, it does for me what was intended; listen to my precious music.<br />E Sweeney Cleveland OH",3,1
"What I love about this radio is the blutooth compability with my iphone; good buy for the money; but the display is horrible, is so dim you can hardly see it. I regret buying it for this reason. I'd not recommend this radio to a friend.",3,2
Good cover but not wide enough for kindle fire hd. Not what I had expected from the description I read.,3,2

"Although the name states 'Portable USB Flash Player', I am unable to get it to play the USB, Even though the music is in the correct format, and I have used this Flash Drive on other devices with success. I rated it 3 stars however because I was able to connect my iPhone and play songs and it has good, strong sound when I did. Still working on the USB which is the whole reason I purchased it.",3,1
"It was great until it just suddenly stopped working - it only lasted 3 months, I'm not sure if this is the norm nowadays, but my previous one lasted a year and a half with heavy use. That seems more reasonable than 3 months.",3,2
I bought this camera recently and was very excited to get it in the car.  Item arrived very quickly and packaging was very well done.  Install was a breeze and it took all of thirty minutes.  The camera itself does not seat properly in my 2006 mazdaspeed 6 so the image lines do not line up correctly and the camera is pointed almost directly at the ground.  Having the view shifted a little higher would make this camera system much more functional.  The image from the camera is very usable during the day time but as far as I know this camera has NO night vision capabilities.  If not for my brake lights I would only get a black screen while reversing at night.  I doubt that any of these issues will be addressed for a car that is a generation old.  I do however feel that the price is right for this camera and would recommend it to anyone who is on the fence about the camera's purchase.,3,2
"As charger for Ipod touch it works, but as soon as you take it into your hands you notice significantly inferior to Apple brand quality. While Apple's Ipod charger whire can charge iPad (slower, but it can), this white wire can connect iPad or iPod to my laptop but shows status not charging.",3,1
FM sounds great but when I plug the iPod to it the sound muffles and also the stereo won't allow you to turn the volume up very high while plugged to the iPod. Not impressed at all,3,1
"This transmitter easily paired with my Phonak Compilot, however the range of the transmitter is much shorter than I hoped it would be.  I have tried moving the transmitter to a number of different location but so far have not found any location or way to significantly improve the range.",3,2
"Its just like most watch bands for this iPod. Cheap and shoddy. The leather is almost like plastic pleather and the loops to hold down the excess band after the buckle are really cheap. I think they would break given any real wear over time. Its one of the better looking bands for the iPod 6th gen that is out there though. Also keep in mind the pleather is actually much lighter then it is in the picture,",3,1
"I like the color and fit of this IPOD case but, it did chip pretty easily when I dropped it.",3,1
My daughter loves it but I ordered the wrong one. I thought it had an MP3 input but it doesnt.,3,1
They showed great till one of them stop working and when I call the store they wouldn't help me out....,3,2
"Got this for general use use with my laptop or iPad for listing to podcast or music while working.  The $40 price and fairly good user rating was a definite enticement to try it over more expensive models and makes. The speaker has a general good sturdy feel for an all plastic body. Plus it came with all the cords needed and a storage/carrying case.<br /><br />Pairing the unit with my iPad was easy. The sound quality was OK on this speaker and far better than my laptop or tablet speakers when earphones are not practical.  The sound quality was fairly flat. Lower frequency/bass is weak at best.  Still it was quite good for voice and background music play. High volumes stain the limits of the speakers and they begin to distort after passing 2/3rds level.<br /><br />However, my unit had a slight buzz and would pop sometimes when activity was paused or stopped.  This was irritating so I decided to returned it. But not before receiving a new Bose Mini BT Speaker, which is in a league far and above this Oontz BT speaker. Side-by-side comparisons were not even close. Having the Bose Mini made returning the Oontz much easier even with the large price differential. I will not be replacing the defective. Still if the speaker had not had any defects, I would have been happy keeping the Oontz for general listen purposes.",3,1
"When I placed the order I though it was going to be shipped from the USA, but to my surprise or that I did not read well your information and it was shipped from CHINA, and it took almost a month to get to me, the postal service from CHINA  is TERRIBLE,<br />Now, the lighter is working fine, but it came without information in  how to operate it , like how and where you could decrease or increase the flame, I have to guess, because what I though it was the screw it wasn't and it kept frustrated  for one day until finally I guessed where I have to use the screw driver to decrease the flame, but the worst was the shipping point, CHINA., I believe you should show better from where the item is coming from.",3,2
The Walkman is a good product. This one replaces one that I purchased many years ago which finally failed. I use this item mostly indoors so the reception  is not always the best however it is comparable to the previous unit.,3,1
"Decent design, but poor materials. After I received this in the mail, I felt kind of ashamed to give it to my mother as a gift. She uses it all the time though. What else can you expect from a Chinese manufacturer?",3,2
"The case started developing a crack in it within the first week.<br />I'd say it's an o.k. product, but I wouldn't order it again.<br />The graphics on it are nice, and don't seem to be rubbing off,<br />so that's a plus!",3,2
This arrived within a reasonable time frame.  It was new and looked really good.  I noticed however that there was a green dot on the end of the plug. I mentioned that to a friend who said you have to be careful about these reproductions as they do not last long.  Mine worked for about three months before it just stopped charging. Other friends later told me the green dot on the end or inside part of the outlet plug was not good.,3,2
Three work well.  One doesn't stop transmitting after you release the button to transmit.  Just stays on until you pull out the batteries.,3,2
"the port where the charger plugs in broke the second time I plugged it in to charge, the recepticle pushed inside the speaker when I tried to plug it in, otherwise I liked the produce, the sound is very good especially considering the size.  Unfortunately I only used it for a short time before it broke, now the battery is dead and I can't recharge it.",3,2
case fits nook color and protects it well. however this case is designed more for the regular nook or kindle due to the strap across the lower half of screen,3,1
The nano accessories were unique and useful. The portable speaker could use a little more kick.,3,1
"It took me a minute to figure out how to make the adjustments and get it \\""working\\"" but once I did, this footrest was fine.  I've been using it now for about two months and my only complaint is that I'm constantly stepping on the rocker pad that sets the angle.  It's ALWAYS loose b/c as you can see in the product picture, it's square in the center of the footrest where as you're moving your chair towards your desk and step to get the momentum and pull, you step.  That's a little cumbersome to constantly have to reset the stupid thing.  But it was only $35 and once I reset it, it's works just fine.      A lot of folks complained about the smell on their reviews...it was definitely there and made itself known once I opened the package.  The smell dissipated though after only a few minutes.  Either I have no sense of smell, my office smells worse, or it truly was just the new smell and wore off once exposed to a less constricted environment.",3,2
"It's definitely okay, and I think well worth the $55 or so that I spent on it.<br /><br />Pro:  Turns on and off depending on my car being on or off.  If you have a car which keeps a constant-powered lighter port, then this will not turn off automatically. Luckily, my Toyota Venza is perfect in this regard.<br /><br />Con:  Buttons are hard to see.  Also getting this on and off the window attachment is TOUGH.  I hate leaving it out in the sun, so I am inclined to take it down from the window.  It is a two-hand job getting this off the window attachment.<br /><br />Overall, I've been happy with it.  Picture quality is decent and certainly worth the price.  Would I buy again?  Yes.",3,1
"This fits the new Sansa Fuze....silicone skin is ok, the standard stuff. Screen protector, is cut to fit. The armband is ok. The clip i got was white, everything else is black. Its ok and about all that is out there at this writing for the Fuze.",3,1
"The cover looks good and cushions well for carrying the Nook in a purse or bag. I bought the cover to protect the Nook since I carry it in my purse most of the time. I also chose it because I love to read in the tub and by the pool. It does its job as a splash proof cover but the velcro does not keep water out. My granddaughter knocked it into the water, I grabbed it before it got all the way in but too late. Water got into the Nook and ruined it.   I had to destroy the case to remove the Nook when trying to get it out quickly.  I would use it as a general use cover but never suggest it to be used around a body of water.",3,1
Product is plastic with metal plated fastener to clip on existing mirror.<br />Viewing coverage is terrific but recently I noticed rusting on the clip to the mirror.<br />Seems like they could have used better plating or stainless steel on metal clip.,3,1
"Works good, Might have to power off and on a few times if  you notice the depth isn't right from past readings. You CANNOT hear the depth alarm or any of them for that matter when the engine is on. it's okay though i suppose for the money.",3,1
"You get what you pay for with this one.  It transmits the signal pretty well, but it stopped charging my phone after about a month.  Easy to use though, and at least I can listen to my music.",3,1
"Cuts down little on glare, does not stick to the screen well. I have two of the Kindle Fores and bought this Anti-Glare Screen Protection for both, followed all the installation instructions, both the product on both units did not seal all the way around the screen",3,2
"It's OK  The earphones are comfortable enough. The battery last over 8hr of usage.  Waterproof... but you have to be careful NOT to screw the earphones too tight or the thread might \\""break\\"". I had to resort to using sealant in order to keep using the device.  You cannot skip folders, just tracks.  It does the job, but it's a basic article.",3,1
Was not loud enough,3,2
So I was thinking this would be higher quality since it's apple certified... I guess not though first day it was awesome and working perfectly but the second night I had it I plugged my phone in with about 25% battery left.  Woke up the next morning and it was at 15% I noticed it wasn't charging and thought I didn't plug it in all the way. I was wrong and found out the actual connector (lighting cable) worked only after I wiggled it around a couple of times.  So this would be a 5 star review or product only if mine hadn't have broken in 2 days...  I would return/exchange it but it's honestly not even worth my time to have to print it out package it and send it off.  I shouldn't have to use my own time on a product that I purchased.,3,2
I bought this because the last one I had would cut my arm. I have used this one a few dozen times and have had mixed results. I have not cut my arm but have had rub marks that are uncomfortable. It might just take some experimenting to get it right.,3,1
"The cables work as described, connects my iPhone or iPad with the extended dock cable to the stereo speaker,  transmits sound & charges as they would be docked in directly.  Could not test video, but according to previous reviews it does that too.  So far that would give it 5 stars BUT I wasn't to happy to receive a used cable with scratches etc.",3,1
"I ordered from an Amazon vendor - they shipped a completely different item to me incorrectly (a video game) - I got in touch with them, and they let me know the CD player was not actually available.  They quickly refunded my money, and told me to keep the video game.  I ordered the product directly from the manufacturer - they shipped immediately, and the cost was actually lower.  It's great from what I wanted - a CD player for my baby's songs that we can tote easily from room to room.",3,1
"It's a great product works well at work, unfortunately the antenna only lasted me a month. Now I'm stuck without a radio and I've been having trouble trying to find a new antenna.",3,2
"These subs thump! Have em hooked up to a PH5000 Boss amp and as of now have no problems! These things have my windows in my car waving so snatch these up! A real bang for your buck!  Update: One of the subwoofers voice coil warp'd from heat in less then a week of having them. Got a new sub (same as before) and hopefully I can get the sound back to where it was. Both of the original subs still work but that 1 makes a scratching noise because of the coil so I bought a new woofer. Still, a good bang for your buck.",3,1
"The product is described accurately, however it does not cover the entire screen,there is space left between the edges.If you have a case around your iPod this makes the space unnoticeable.It is a perfect mirror that I find useful for applying make-up on the go. It does have a tint to it so you may need to adjust screen brightness as other users have suggested. Also under bright light it plays as a reflector so this may cause an issue for some ppl, luckily they peel of very easily if you are not satisfied with the product.",3,1
First off this is not my first Zen and I have been happy with my previous Zen(3) products. I was disappointed to find the setup.exe file was not included in the product when I plugged it into my PC. Probably because it was a refurbished player. This caused a delay in being able to use the product. This delay is the only reason for only three stars.,3,2
It's being sold as a &#34;latching&#34; unit but in fact it is momentary. Once button is released the relay turns off. Also need to mention that only  one relay can be activated. I had to jumper pins to make other one work. False advertising.,3,2
"While the case is very pretty, it easily snaps apart and doesn't stay in place. The mirror screen, however, was more than enough for me to what to buy this, because it's incredibly convenient and still protects my iPod.",3,1
"The film is not flat but a little dull. Maybe this is out of the consideration of Anti-Glare, but it is really unconfortable.",3,2
"like the title, this is prolly the best for the vision, since there isn't as much focus on making cases for the zen as there is on the ipod........however the case is very nice, but the accessories are a little cheap, i havent tried out the belt clip yet, but the armband is too small for my arm, so unless your a girl or a guy with small arms the armband is useless......",3,1
worked ok,3,1
"I tried to purchase this product from Amazon three times because the first two times it arrived damaged.  To add insult to injury, every time I asked for a replacement they wouldn't honor it (thought they did give me a full refund and paid for return shipment) and when I reordered the price would jump around $10 each time.  I waited until the price dropped to an acceptable level before I ordered it yet again.  This time it arrived undamaged.<br /><br />Now on to the product: The size is as advertised and the casing of the product is not a sturdy as it appears. Nor is the product is as heavy as you would think it would be.  But it's solid enough.  As for the picture, I don't find it as bright or sharp as you would expect.  It's not bad, it can be adjusted, and it depends on the angle of the screen to the viewer, but overall the quality is okay.  Another review commented on how short the length of the power cord/adapter.  The reviewer is right: the player must be practically on top of or next to the power socket.<br /><br />So far I've tested the machine by playing four types of mediums: music CD; a purchased movie and TV show; a burned DVD, and a DVD containing shows copied from TV and recorded on a disc with a DVD recorder.  So far the machine has played all the discs without any difficulty, which is surprising.  The disc does have to be almost flawless, as the machine will have a problem with playback if there's considerable smudges and scratches (but many machines will have that difficulty).  One issue is that normally when a portable DVD player is on but at rest, the screen will either go into screen saver mode or the machine will simply shut down.  This machine won't do either; it will remain at the DVD factory screen.  There could be a way to reset this, but I haven't found it yet.  Also for some reason when I turn on the machine from standby mode and play a  purchased movies or shows, the subtitles will display when the event starts.  This is very annoying because I have to go to the menu and turn off the subtitles.  And the subtitles display on the TOP of the screen.  I find this very odd.  But I'm sure there's a way to prevent this from happening; I just haven't figured it out yet.  I will write an update to this review to discuss the other options of product (TV, USB, WiFi, etc.).<br /><br />The buttons on the machine for basic functions (skip, fast forward, stop, menu, etc,) is prominently displayed and I find the layout pretty solid and sound.  But there is a slight lag when you press a command.  For example, there seems to be one second lag between when you press the pause, skip or other functions during play before the command takes effect.  It's very different from other DVD players where the commands are achieved almost instantaneous.  It's not a major issue, but it's just odd.<br /><br />By far the biggest drawback is the remote control.  It's about the size of a post-it pad: it's very small and easy to misplace.  But a greater drawback is the layout of the button.  One has to use their fingernails to press most of the buttons because they are so small and close together.  In addition, with a few exceptions the buttons are in the same shape and size, resulting in a lack of differentiation between may of the most commonly used functions.  And I swear there must be forty buttons on this tiny remote: thirty of them are exactly the same shape and size.  I'm definitely considering getting a low-cost universal remote control (a learning remote) to use in place of the one provided.  And the remote must be pointed directly in front of the sensor, otherwise it won't work.<br /><br />If this player was any more expensive, I would consider it a bust.  But given the price of the product and the basic quality, this was not a bad purchase.  I know other reviewers have mentioned the machine breaking down after a short time.  But after several months use the it's still operating quite well.  There's definitely better options out there, products of higher quality and less expensive.  But for the options this one provides with the low price, this is a solid buy.",3,1

Cons:  The two separate pieces of this cover come off very easily. I had to put the Apple sticker to hold it together...     Pro:  Protects the iTouch well  Keeps the itouch as slim as it can be with a case,3,1
"THIS RADIO IS AWESOME LOOKING, MADE REALLY WELL.  THE SOUND COULD BE BETTER.  IT SOUNDS A LITTLE TOO BASSY AND MUFFLED.  I HAVE A PRETTY BIG KITCHEN, THATS WHERE I HAVE IT, AND I REALLY CAN NOT HERE IT TOO WELL IN THE NEXT ROOM OVER.  OVERALL, IF YOU ARE BUYING THIS FOR JUST ONE ROOM IT'S OK, BUT IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON LEAVING IT IN A ROOM TO LISTEN THROUGHOUT YOUR HOUSE OR APARTMENT, I WOULD LOOK ELSEWHERE.  I HOPE THIS HELPED YOU A BIT.",3,1
It works fine with the TV but for some reason with the stereo the sound becomes very distorted if you turn it up hardly at all.,3,1
"I bought this product in the middle of July this year.  The first one I received was broken so I sent it back and got another one. Since the end of July it has been working great.  When I get a mp3 it lasts for a couple months and no more because I always manage to pick the crappy ones.  This lasted a while for me considering it's the end of December and I used it a lot.  The problem with these mp3 players is that they are a touchscreen and they do not come with warranty.  So this is more about all mp3 player then just this one.  Never get a touch screen as they wear out quickly and don't get one without warranty.  All in all, this mp3 player was really nice.  It lasted for quite a while, you can put your pictures and music on here, it has a lock button, and a sd card slot.  One word of warning, it is very sensitive,  so you have to take extra care of it.",3,2
"The product is good but the remote control is useless, I expected to be able to control the phone or the USB from it",3,1
Well I installed this sub into a sealed box that almost exactly matched the air space requirement from Rockford Fosgate. Matched it with a RF amp that also matched the 250wrms @ 2 ohms.. and the sub blew after about a week. If you want real bass figure out a way to get a non-shallow sub to fit one way or the other.,3,1
This sticker decal is great it hasnt come off or started to peel. I've spilled water all over it several times and it's stonger then ever. The only side I have is that I chose a white sticker so it shows dirt on the side which is a bit gross.,3,1
This item has been ok. Easy enough to use. The CD player plays for awhile then starts to skip or gets hung up on me repeatedly regardless of which CD I am playing. This has been a hassle. I like the slim design.,3,1

"Nice cover,  leaves stains on my wight glowlight, also it pushes the  &#34;n&#34;  button all the time causing poor battery life.",3,2
"Yeah, I totally fell for the kick-stand.  You know what it doesn't do? Stand.  However, the charger, outlet changer, and screen protector, and extra USB cable definitely are worth it.",3,2
Good product that will do the job but the part that mounts on the radio is plastic and will break easily.,3,1
"The screen protector is 1 - 2 mm too big so needs to be trimmed.  I've installed scratch/glare films on a number of devices and this was by far the most difficult one I've worked with.  Despite my best efforts, it still managed to attract dirt particles.  Trying to lift and reposition the film all but makes it unusable.<br /><br />Once applied, it does a great job of preventing glare.  Without it, I was constantly shifting my tablet to eliminate glare and reflections to watch video on an airplane.  There is some reduction in brightness and sharpness, but that's to be expected.",3,1
"I bought it to play music. It works pretty well for that, but as another reviewer commented, the cassette drive wheels click annoyingly. That's my biggest complaint.<br /><br />I did experiment with using it for a phone call. I could hear the other party, but the other party wasn't able to hear me. It could be a configuration problem on my part, but I haven't investigated further. I didn't buy it for the phone capabilities.<br /><br />I would prefer a longer battery life. I'm skeptical it is quite a long as advertised, but I've seen 4 hours of continuous playback without recharging. It seems to make it through 1.5 commutes which is about 4.5 hours, but I haven't timed those sessions precisely.",3,1
Transmission and reception volume is a little low.,3,1
nice case but only the gps unit fits in it. i should have bought a larger case that would hold all of the attachments too,3,1
"It's wicked cute.  I wish it curved around the front slightly, I like the type that has too parts and rounds the front edges a little, this is extremely easy to remove which also means it's not quite as protective.",3,1
"I was relying on the fact that it just won't slip from my nook. Sure enough it didn't slip off but when I'm holding it, sometimes when i press on the nook a bit harder on one side, the other side looks like it's popping off.<br /><br />As for the cover, the colors are vibrant. Almost 2 weeks now with me and still not a scratch.<br /><br />Overall it doesn't affect the way I use my nook and it doesn't weigh it down either. Just the discomfort of feeling the cover might come off is making me uneasy.",3,1
"I really, really want to like this speaker...but all I can hear is the bass.  It is very overwhelming! For a company to exist in today's market they really need to focus on details; especially when it would not really cost extra to put in customizable options. There are built in equalizer tech, app tech and just plain old fashion bass/treble adjustments that could have been built into the Stelle Audio pillar and it would be the king of all wireless/portable home audio.<br /><br />I dont really see this speaker as being practical for outside the home use, as it is far to expensive, but you can do that if you choose (may be nice for an extended stay vacation or something similar). The bluetooth connected easily to my Note 4 but it constantly cuts out briefly every couple minutes which is pretty annoying; another easy solve by use of proper technology. So much for wireless... However, once connected to my laptop )via included cable) it's a whole different ball game! Now I have access to my Graphic Equalizer, and Presto Chango, I have a great looking (best in my opinion) speaker that sounds FANTASTIC!!!<br /><br />So, Stelle, if you read product reviews from your customers you may want to take immediate action and put in the ability to adjust treble/bass at the minimum, but you really should put in a proper equalizer, or equalizer app (Google Play has one, Samsung Shape has one, Sonos 5 has one, etc...) plus wifi and /or better wireless interface, and then you will have the best speaker on the market!",3,1

"I purchased the mount a week ago, had a little diffuculty locating a place on the harley tour bike handlebars for a mounting location.  I eventually was able to secure it to the bars very close to where the bars mount. The diameter of the gps mount was smaller than the harley bars - by about a quarter inch. But so far the mount is holding the gps securely. There is little room for adjustment in the location.With  gps in the mount the screen is fairly visible although there is the problem with sun glare when the sun/gps are aligned.   I used the gps yesterday while riding  for directions. I was satisfied.  For the price which is is a fraction of any other price found I would reccommnend this item for purchase.

This product is better suited for chldren: it's made of blue plastic and is a little cheesey looking; it's a bit hard to handle; it has no fastener for a belt so you'd better have huge pockets if you're going anywhere with it and its function buttons are so small and camoflaged most adults I know will have problems running it.    Earphones are better than I thought they'd be and it does do its job rather well, but kids/some teens will like this far more than adults.",3,1
"My daughter was so very excited to get this mp3 player.  It worked great for about a month, then the place where the headphones plugs in started shorting out.  She can't wear it when she moves around, she just has to sit in one place and not move the player or her head, the music stops playing if it gets moved.  It is so unfortunate because otherwise, it would be an awesome player!",3,2
Worked great for a while then got water in it and no longer works.,3,1
The case doesn't want to stay on very well.  Wish it was more durable.  It looks good tho.,3,1
I ordered a green one and they sent me a light blue one... they give u a choice to pick color yet they ignore it..the sound is good for a small room,3,1
How it can be charged?,3,1
do need it ?,3,1
"Before i bought my Coby player i ensured to read some of the posted reviews. It has been five days since i have had my player and unfortunately i am unsatisfied. It was not fully charged when i opened it (but that's okay), however i have been charging this player day in and day out and its to no avail. The most charge its taking is quarter and i am very much confused by this.<br />Everything else i can work with, like the slow reading of pictures, but the charging issue is really killing me and unfortunately its not that easy to return it as i live in the Caribbean (Trinidad West Indies) and it would be very costly.<br />If there is anyone else who experienced this; i hope they can offer some advice.",3,2
If you have the wrap around earphones you will have a problem getting them inside this case in order to close it.That's my only issue with this product.,3,1
The transmitter works good but I don't think it is worth the money. I tried a couple of ebay transmitters for half the price and I can't tell the difference between the Clear Sounds and the Ebay transmitter.,3,1
"Well, its not too expensive, and plays music. The positive portion of the review.<br /><br />Once you figure out an incredibly difficult to maneuver interface. For me, not worth the trouble. I'll go back to a slightly more expensive Coby in the future that is dramatically easier to work through.",3,2
"Having trouble with instructions and making it work properly.  I was taking pictures when I thought I was shooting video.  And in the instructions it mentioned a red, blue, and green led. I have yet seen a green light.  ????",3,1
I received this item and it looked like the apple charger but it was not. It worked well once and then broke in my phone. The upside was that customer service sent me an email after my first review and they were nice enough to offer me a refund for the broken product.,3,2
Works but really limited distance - 10ft?,3,1
"This is a very tempermental adapter, it refused to work with my walkman in my car, so i went and bought a better one at the dllar store.",3,1
"These rusted within two weeks on a bike that is kept in the garage, granted I live at the beach in northern Oregon, but they shouldn't have rusted that quickly.  Plus when the bike went over at a standstill, they bent way too easy.  Was able to bend back by pushing forward with foot while setting on bike.",3,2
"Bluetooth works.  Works pretty flawlessly for me.  Cheap.    But the speaker quality is rather lacking.  The sound is only marginally better than the speaker built into my phone.  It's not painfully bad, but it's the worst speaker in my house that's not in a hand-held device.",3,2
This product is alright. Kinda had a hard time with trying to use the covering while trying to use the click wheel on my ipod.,3,1
I HAVE AN OLDER SONY PLAYER  THAT'S BIGGER THAN THIS ONE. PERHAPS THAT'S WHY IT SOUNDS BETTER. IT HAS MEGABASE FEATURE. THIS ONE DOES NOT SOUND THAT GREAT COMPARED TO THE TWO.SOMETIMES I HAVE TO JIGGLE THE AC CORD IN ORDER FOR IT TO WORK.,3,1
Could not get the Bluetooth  feature to function.,3,2
"but a little disappointed with the quality.  Description was a bit misleading especially as to dimensions and my NOOK is not as firmly anchored as it should be.  It is, as indicated, adequate to protect the NOOK but if your NOOK is in frequent use I would reccomend looking at some of the other cases",3,2
The shipping took almost two weeks!! but the price was good and it came in good condition so idk i like it but im still mad at the shipping and how long it took lol,3,1
"I sent in a camera purchased through Amazon Warehouse for two repairs.  The process of filing the claim was simple, the turn around time was quick and the camera was returned to me well packaged.  The only problem is they didn't fix either of the issues I had.<br /><br />Upon speaking with the very nice gentleman at SquareTrade, I was advised they would give me a label and I could send the camera back to be inspected again.  For the time being I have declined, as I would like to use the camera for a bit before shipping it off again.  I was told I have 90 days to send the camera back in for inspection.<br /><br />This is all well and good, and I understand things happen and something isn't always fixed properly the first time.  But BOTH problems - independent of one another - not being repaired is unacceptable.  I was never contacted by anyone during the repair process to advise me that there was an issue completing the repairs, and SquareTrade's records show that repairs were made.  So what gives?<br /><br />SquareTrade is still offering to work to resolve the problems, so I am not looking to drag them through the mud.  But this experience has gone from being a smooth one to an inconvenient one, and thus my rating.",3,1
"There isn't a good pocket for a wallet and other things about that size. Sure, I could put my wallet in the large center section, but I wanted to see a right-sized wallet pocket.  Call me particular.  I don't want a pocket for every individual thing.  I prefer a pocket that holds a few similar items such as one pocket for keys, wallet and FOB.  Another pocket for passport and certificates, etc.  These are just random examples.  The reason I didn't find the bag useful as I would have liked was I prefer a little larger pockets and fewer of them.",3,1
The 12v powered transmitter provides a good strong signal. The articulating support arm is a nice feature. But neither my ipod nano or iphone fit properly in it and would wiggle loose unless I wedged something behind them to hold them in place. I will look for a universal version with a clamp feature.,3,1
"The gadget definitely did what I wanted it to do, namely got my Magellan off the dashboard<br />That said - it is a little cumbersome and ackward to use. The clips dont quite function well and its hard to mound the actual unit<br />In addition - since the unit mounts to the A/C vent - the cold air is constantly blowing onto the back (although it could be a good thing - cooling it down)",3,1
"I got the case because I thought a clear case would be a great way to protect the ipod, however, the case arrived with several scratches.  The type of scratches on the plastic case couldn't be felt, but they still appeared on the case...so I don't know how that works.  Also, trying to put the case on the ipod was difficult, I felt like I would break the ipod when I was trying to get the two separate pieces to attach.  Luckily, it was only a couple of bucks.  I would not buy it again.",3,2
"I received the item quickly and it worked fine at first, but over the few days it won't connect to my Bluetooth head phones, even though they worked together at first.  I'm perplexed. So, needless to say, I'm somewhat bummed that it is already not working.",3,2
"Sound not very good, one input, no remote output ports, only cord include is power cord and it does not stay connected to unit",3,2
Sorry to say that this product did not work. I waited weeks before getting to it. I should have contacted seller but did not. My fault.,3,2
Nice little unit except it cuts out every so often.,3,1
"Ordered 5 of these for our office.  They are crazy cheap, and work ok.  Had issues with two of them. One got pretty hot at one point, don't know if that is normal.  The other came apart a little bit.  They both are working fine though.  For the price I would say that they are worth it.  Thy ship from over seas, so it may take a little while to be delivered.",3,1
It is very cute but one arm broke. Kids are kids & they're hard on their stuff.,3,1
"I'd like to start off by saying if you need a cheap easy to install antenna for some FM stations, to get you by until you can get an expensive one, then this is what you want to buy.<br /><br />Pros: installs quick and easy (no drilling or dismantling)<br />Very inexpensive<br />Picks up some close by radio stations<br /><br />Cons: a lot of radio static regardless of mounting location (even in major metro areas)<br />Build quality is questionable<br />Doesn't pick up many stations clearly and no AM for those of you into that",3,1
"Cheap material, but you get what you pay for, right? For the price and for non-race application I would recommend, but other than that, don't expect much more than just a cheap alternative to the OEM hood release.",3,1
I contacted the manufacture directly and explained that it will not playback the video or the GPS routes and the maps through their software. That I had to use Quick Time and could only view each file by them self.<br /><br />The manufacture told me to download BlackVue v1002 and to go to a PC and fix the problem. Yes I told them that I had a MAC computer. They said to me to do this twice.<br /><br />It still does not run properly.<br /><br />The quality of the camera is really great,3,1
I should have looked closer at the picture. This doesn't fit a normal size mirror on a semi or dump truck.The screws  aren't  long enough and there's no gap in both sides. If you look at my picture you'll see the difference  between a standard mount and this.,3,1
"the case is nice, but built slightly cheap. I thought it was broken when i first got it because there are slits in the sides not sure quite why",3,2
The Nook Cover is similar to a product I had purchase at Barnes & Noble.  I had problems with the magnetic clasp.  The magnet moved out of position so the book cover could not be fully closed.  I hope I have better luck with this new cover..,3,2
This case is for anyone who don't like to protect their phone. Case was to tight and the credit card slot was tight and a little sticky. I wouldn't advise anyone to place anything in that slot not even money.,3,2
"It didn't work for me. I have an iPhone 6 & 6+. The speaker just kept skipping. It's the same blutooth problems many people complain of. I even tried my iPod touch, same problem. The speaker itself seemed quite well made & fairly loud. Good luck getting it to sync with any apple device though.",3,1
"Walkies were on my four yr old daughter's holiday wish list and I searched high and low for feminine walkies. While they've been a hit (cute, light, and portable) with her, family and friends of both genders and of all ages, there is definitely inteference. Also, I found these same walkies at a store for $10 less a wk later.",3,1
Pros:  GPS and vehicle speed on the video.<br /><br />Cons:  The camera will not retain the time.  It must be updated every time I get in the car.,3,1
"After a few uses the charger came apart at the seams and when I put it back together, one side did not work. Guess I should have taped it first...",3,2
"One can never have enough spare chargers! I purchased this as an extra charger to keep in my kitchen for an extra \\""boost\\"" when needed.<br />  The Good:The quality looks and feels just like the one that Apple provided with my phone. The cable separates from the square outlet piece so that it can be used as a separate USB cable. It should be noted that I am able to charge the phone while it is still in its \\""Otter Box\\"" case.<br />  The Bad: The USB portion that is inserted into the square outlet piece does not go in all the way. It does not have a snug fit... while the other end which connects to my phone can be a challenge to disconnect and takes a little \\""jiggling\\"".<br />  Bottom Line: It works and charges my phone just fine! For the price it is worth it, even though I feel there is something \\""off\\"" with the connection fit. It should also be noted that NOT all chargers are created equal. Beware that as the item states it is a charger for iPhone4, 3Gs and iPods. This will not charge an iPad.",3,1
It plays ok. It does not come with a memory card. I put in a 16 bit card and it works fine. No shuffel capability.,3,1
"The reviews are pretty accurate that I read. It was delivered very fast.  I was happy with the ease of use.  It is easy to transfer between my two cars, however I would agree that it is a bit cheap feeling. I wonder if all the transferring back and forth is going to make it just fall apart.  The ipod is easy to hook up and remove.      I read about some of the static and experienced it in one of my cars, but not the other.  So I don't know if it is more of an antenna issue in my car than the kit. Ironically, it sounds better in my older car with an antenna that doesn't work so well. I was thinking it could be that the older antenna picks up less interference from radio. Just a thought.    Overall, knowing what I know now, weighing price and performance, I am still happy I bought it.",3,1
"I haven't used it enough to get super familiar with it, but I did find, like another reviewer, that it can be very staticky at times.  There aren't a lot of instructions for how to find the station that you will run your device through, but all in all I am satisfied with this purchase.",3,1
"I own some Tweakers Lites and bought these, since the kids are using mine.  I liked the price on these for the kids.  Be aware, these don't sound like the Tweakers Lites.  They are alright and I will keep them, for the kids to use. If you want really good sound, make sure you get the original Tweakers Lites brand.  The balance between the right and the left speakers is off and you need to have one further away to try to balance this out.  The dials aren't as smooth to use and the ends take a little effort to pop open and to close.  Again, you get what you pay for.  Just be aware, there is definately a difference in this brand and the original.  I rated this three stars because it says three stars is: It's ok.  I would give it two stars, but it's ok for the kids to use.",3,1
It was rubber and it isnt a case that is going to keep your ipod safe enough against scratched or other damage,3,1
"I don't think this is leather, but I could be wrong.  Seems to be holding up well for my son, would probably buy another.",3,2
The silicone case does protect the unit.  Cons : it is a little slippery and the stand on the back doesn't work very well,3,1
"This is a great-looking product.  But, it doesn't sound so great.  Not enough depth to the sound; rather tinny.  The reason I purchased it was:  it is very small and takes up hardly any space.  It has both a cassette player and a CD player.  It is a Sony and they usually last a reasonable time.      I just feel that with today's technology, and at this price, this product should have better sound quality.",3,2
"Works great, but not very good quality.  It's plastic and pretty cheaply made.",3,1
"Did not know it was so flimsy, but it will work for the price. Love the color. Would probably get more of them later on when needed in different colors.",3,1
"I received the speakers in a small white box with instructions, it was packaged well. Wasn't too thrilled that you can't plug them into the wall and either need to have AAA batteries or you have to plug it into your computer.   For the price that I paid I'm happy with them, they will work for what I wanted them for...to take on trips so I can listen to my music and small enough to carry in my purse or carry on if needed.  Sound isn't bad for the size of the speakers.  Pretty much you get what you pay for so I wasn't expecting anything grand for $8. If you are looking for something to take with you on trips these speakers will work just fine.  [[ASIN:B0047EXOIU Speaker Fold-up Docking Station Black for Apple Iphone 4/4G]]",3,1
"It is very good, the only thing is that sometimes the sound is interrupted, but I contacted the seller and as always respond satisfactorily amazon and I are going to replace, thanks amazon, you're the best .Excellent seller, efficiently respond to any problems that arise, thanks HDE ....",3,1
"This is a nice case, but keep in mind that it's terrible when it comes to protection. Good case though",3,1
The ipod fits very snug in the holder.  The treads on the case stick up.  I would not have purchased had I known all of the defects.  It is ok,3,2
"well ok; it does hold the nano on your wrist like a watch which is cool. The problem is that it's such a pain in the butt to put this wrist band on; it's practically a two person operation! Secondly, it doesn't allow for the connection to the input/power socket on the nano. This means that you have to remove it from the wrist band to charge it, which is also a pain to do. Other than that, it's pretty nice.",3,1
"Pro's:<br />- Supports many book formats<br />- Has nice contrast ratio (darker blacks than e-ink)<br />- Lightweight and portable, fits within the inside pocket of a jacket, and even in a side pocket of a jeans pants<br />- Comes with a software CD (never used it), a USB charger and a reinforced (for the screen) pouch.<br />- Fast turn pages, responsive menu, good menu structure, reasonably solid OS.<br />-<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The battery life is rather low. It's ok but compared to e-ink, this device has twice the battery capacity, and only a running time of 24 hours.<br />- the device has a USB 1.1 port, and transfer speeds are very slow!<br />- Rather low resolution (640x480 pix)<br />- Sometimes when a pixel is half black, half white (like on a border between text and no text) the pixel is flickering. Especially visible with smaller letter types.<br />- Mostly only good for text files with occasional pictures; pr pdf files with reflow; I prefer to read pdf files on larger devices though, because they lose formatting and images when displaying them reflowed.<br />- Weak slider bar on the left (for page turns)<br />- Buttons not very well placed for people with large hands<br />- Reading under very low light (eg candle light) is much harder to read than e-ink screens or paper books, due to the grey background.<br />- 'Perfect' font of 14pt is not available. Only 16pt, slightly too large text, or 12pt, slightly too small letters to read.<br />- Too expensive for what it's worth. A good price would be ~$49.99 -54.99 for this device.<br /><br />Other thoughts:<br />- Use an external card reader to save your books to the SD card, and insert the card in the device, don't transfer the files directly to the SD card via the mini, because it takes forever (transfer speeds in the likes of ~150kb/s.<br /><br />Reason to buy:<br />I bought mine for $39.99, you can look around and buy them for that price. This reader is worth the $40 price tag, even $50, but not more than that.<br /><br />This device is a good device to read .epub, .mobi and .prc files on.

"I purchased an iPhone 4 and like everyone, wanted a way to protect my investment as much as I could.  Before buying this product, I bought a 3 pack off a website for $2 shipped and bought a 6 pack for $5 from Ebay.  I do have prior experience with this kind of stuff, having protected all my electronics and not to mention I've put several clear bras on cars as well.  The key here is your environment, if you can't produce a perfect environment with absolutely zero lint or dust fragments, then forget it.  No matter how small it is, you're going to see it.  I went through 9 screens doing everything I can, but it just didn't work.  I did get one good one with absolutely zero lint but I didn't like the way the holes were cut on that one.  Since I want it just to be perfect, I gave Splash guards a try afterall, it's an Iphone!  I must admit that I do like the way they cut their holes but again, if you can't create that perfect environment, forget about.  This product isn't that much easier to work with nor will it resist lint on to the sticky nor is it made out of a superior product.  My best advice is not to buy this product but something a lot cheaper on the internet and buy lot of it and just keep trying until you get it perfect.  I just don't think 3 is going to be enough, just my 2 cents.  Great vendors though, ordered it on a Saturday and it arrived on a Monday.",3,1
Don't get the Camo... It's unlike the picture displayed its fugly! Reconsider another color. Wish they had another color other than black that looks better in a military uniform. The product itself isn't bad and exactly what I thought it'd be.,3,2
usb plug is kind of flimsy,3,1
"the old one I had was good enough to do what needed to do. Guess,I  should have opted for Print Shop.",3,1
Rather bulky.,3,1
"nice color, two piece design. Works just fine. Not a perfect fit, but it works and we are happy with it. Finding a case for a ipod touch 3G is difficult so I was happy to see some still available",3,1
"Somewhat cheap feeling material, but it does work. I do have to walk around the house a bit while pressing the button to find my keys if there are walls in between the keys and the remote. 30 meters sounds about right as long as there isn't walls in between.",3,1
I got this for my doughter its preety good it came with 2 songs and 4 games but we could only figure out how to play 2 becouse the other 2 were chinese we tryed to download songs on it but we couldnt figure it out the pictures are not goodand the graphics suck do t get this made in china and freezes sometimes.,3,2
"Item was OK, but it didn't have any manual (as supposed to be as being a new product!!). The remote controller is not easy to work with. Sounds are good, but fades sometimes and the quality diminishes for the tiny thin sounds.....OK product for a cheap price!",3,2
The clock and ipod player is a very nice addition to our bedroom.  My only complaint is that you need to double check to make sure the alarm is actually on.  You can easily think it is set when it is not.,3,1
"Just received it a few days ago and it seems to work ok. Never the less, the remote control is ridiculous. You actually have to walk up to the stereo in order to get the remote working.Every time you turn on the stereo , in order to listen to the music,  you need to increase the volume because it's always on the lowest level. I guess you get what you pay for. It's cheap!",3,2
have'nt figured it out yet but it plays the cassettes and sounds good.,3,1
This works OK but the sound quality is not as good as others I have used. For the price I am not really complaining but I did get what I paid for.,3,1
"software on disc doesn't work. I had to buy it online for $100 more.<br /><br />once I had the correct software, it worked fine.  I just wish I didn't have to spend $100",3,2
It works except the speaker doesn't work so she can't listen to her music or face time buddies without the earbuds.,3,1
"The actual case is what you would expect for the money.  Fairly cheap construction.  We'll see how long it stands up to my eight year old son's daily routine.    The \\""small detail\\"" for us was the screen protector.  It has two tabs that are adhered to the screen protector for pulling the backing off the protector and then applying it.  The problem is that the adhesive used for the tabs stays on the protector rendering the protector useless.  As we tried to rub the adhesive off, it started to get onto the ipod.  Big mess!",3,1
The amp was aweful and the circuitry is aweful. The amp overheats and it cuts out ALOT! The speakers are worth the money but i suggest buying a different amp.,3,2
"It is a great bargain case. It is pretty cheap. However, I was disappointed that the case gets dirt inside. the case is kind of hard to get off but gets easier each time till the iPod can't stay inside anymore. So, it is a cheap, temporary case.",3,2
"The case would do better if it wrapped around the ipod a bit to protect the glass. After falling a couple of times, it started to fall apart as did the ipod.",3,2
"I purchased this case because I do like the hard clear cases for my iPod. The only issue I am having with this case is that i have to either take it off entirely or open a bottom corner of the case to either insert my lightening cable of my headphone cable. I do not think it is the designer of the case's fault, it is just the design of the new Nano itself. The ports themselves are on the very edge of the iPod which makes things hard as is. This is a good case.",3,1
"JUST OK DUST AND DIRT GET UNDER IT AFTER A WHILE. BUBBLES FORMS ALSO. THE GOOD THING IS THE COST, SO THAT IS WHY I GAVE 3 STARS.",3,1
"it works ok. i thought it would work better than it does, but it is ok for the back of a hot car.",3,2
"This item works ok except that on the nook tablet, the corners wrap right around the sleep button and the sound buttons at the top!  My granddaughter loves the look and it does protect it but you just can't hook on all 4 corners.",3,1
How do you download a DVD or video on the MP4 Spinn. I am having a hard time doing it. Otherwise I love my MP4 Spinn player.  Arlene,3,1
"my problem is not with the product--it is with the company i ordered from.  the first time they sent, they sent the wrong size.  it did not fit the 4g, it was for the iphone.  the second time, the item was wrong again.  they sent a harder type rubber and see through color rather than the solid color soft gel silicone.  this is not what i ordered so i told them to not charge me for anything and to forget the whole thing.  no confidence in them getting it right.",3,2
Would be nice if it had up to date directions current vendors and links to prices. I Would not recommend this to any one serious about doing a conversion may be a good reference to a first time person looking at different ideas.,3,2
The SD card slot is a little rough to get cards in and out. Camera is light weight and seems easy to use.,3,1
"This case was durable and fit only my garmin gps.  It delivered what it was suppose to do.  Expected delivery time was not as expected but no fault of the company.  After I email them, they were quick to re-send and it was received 2 days later before my trip which I truly appreciate.",3,1
"This product works great for holding and charging my ipod in the car. It also puts it in a great position to access the ipod's controls. The FM transmitter, however, is horrible. It did not work at all in the lower frequencies. I normally use 88.9 in my car and it was unlistenable at this frequency. I did get it to work at 107.1, but the sound quality wasn't very good. I will use it to listen to podcasts, but it is terrible for listening to music.",3,2
"It had a good run. The Velcro strap broke, but that is inevitable to happen with any of these types of arm bands.",3,2
"The light itself is great, but the back cover doesn't fit once the battery is inserted.  I had to tape it back together with packing tape so that the battery could make contact and the light would function.",3,1
Even though this item is shown as a charger as well as a transmitter what I received is not as the picture shows.,3,2
"I bought this product to use with my Ipod. Only it didn't work at all for my Ipod, but it does work with my husbands Iphone so I just took his charger and gave him this one. So all worked out in the end. Just one thing...DON'T buy this for an Ipod, it won't work.",3,2
love it,3,1
"Well, you get what you pay for.<br /><br />The good thing about this case is that it has some weight to it, so my iPod doesn't seem so light. Also, it seems pretty protective and has a decent design. However, the design does not match it's picture. The pattern on my case is a little off, and the blue inner lining (it feels somewhat squishy, I guess you would say) is cut poorly. You can visually see the excess lining that wasn't cut off. It's weird. To add, the colors are a little strange and don't match the image of the design I chose (for example, the pink seems almost red...) It was also very difficult to put on. It took me a whole 20 minutes to try to snap this onto my iPod without breaking it!<br />It's alright. Don't waste your time, though.",3,2
"This is not a secure scabbard. The latch can open accidentally very easy then the tomahawk can fall out and injure you or some one below you. This holder rattles and I don't trust the gadget that allows you to spin the scabbard to different angels. All of the components make the tomahawk stick out and catch on brush making more noise. In one day of harvesting bamboo it fell out twice causing me to have to go back and find it. The last time it fell out it bounced off of my calf. I'm lucky it didn't cut me. Good idea just needs to be refined. I have and use several of these tools so I hope someone makes a sheath, scabbard or holder for these popular tomahawks.",3,2
While the sound is extremely good and what you would expect from Pioneer the functionality is poor.  You cannot read the station Setting for the radio which makes it dangerous while driving.  Making your own presets for the radio is overly complicated and has yet worked for me.  The great stuff is the ap control is pretty intuitive and the radio works well with Android devices.,3,1
"I needed a portable battery for hiking since I like to have my GPS on to track my distances/speed/etc. But the GPS kills the battery on my Galaxy S wi-fi ridiculously fast. Without a backup battery, my GPS would last about 4 hours before dying.  I followed the instructions for the ReVIVE XL and fully charged then drained the battery a couple times then took it on a 20.5 mile hike. The battery worked great as a backup battery. During the hike, I let it charge for a few hours and it managed to accumulate 1 bar, which is fine. The instructions did say it needed to be charging for at least 13 hours to be fully charged.<br /><br />Because of the ReVIVE XL my GPS managed to last 10 hours before the battery ran out and the GPS died at the very last 0.5 mile of the hike. This only showed me I clearly needed a higher capacity battery.<br /><br />So as a backup battery, this is great. While using this as a normal charge for my Kindle and mp3 player, it was fine and can last a few charges.<br /><br />However, the main problem, like many others have mentioned, is that the solar charging is lacking. I left the charger out in full sunlight outside for 2 full days and the highest charge I got was 2 bars. I left it out for a week and it was still 2 bars.<br /><br />No matter how many days I leave the charger out in the sunlight, I never get past 2 bars of charging. The only time I get past 2 bars is if I charge it through USB.<br /><br />At the price I paid, I feel like it should charge better in sunlight even after about 5 cycles to ‘exercise’ the battery, but I still only got 2 bars.<br /><br />Also for the about the same price I could get a 12,000mAh portable battery. With that capacity, I’m pretty sure my GPS will still be working after a 13 hour hike and then some.<br /><br />Although I did like that I could hang the charger off my backpack with the carabiner. I wouldn’t trust the window suctions to stay in place while I was driving. I didn’t use the solar panel extender since I didn’t want to spend more money for extra panels to only get 2 bars of solar charging.<br /><br />This is a decent product, good backup battery, but terrible solar charger. It should be marketed as a portable battery with minor solar charging ability, and not a “solar charging&#34; battery,",3,1
"The aesthetics of this thing is 5stars.  I love the way it looks and feels.  Built very solid, and it is a pretty cool speaker for the price. And while the highs and mids sound great on this little speaker, the bass is almost non-existent, and the Bluetooth range is smaller than advertised.<br /><br />It is a nice little speaker, and if you listen to bass-free music than it is an awesome pickup.  However for my needs I feel that the braven 625s had just about the same sound quality with a number of more features offers more value.",3,1

"Don't waste your money unless you live in the shadow of a TV station. I have owned this little TV about 4 months now. I find the picture to be very sharp, that is if you can get a picture.

"Pros:    1) The stand design is quite nifty and useful. Looks sturdy till now:)  2) The fit is good  3) Decent quality  4) The side buttons and keypad can be used without any problems.  5) It does serve well enough in protecting the kindle    Cons  1) Closing and opening it is a but tough, u have to dig your nails inside to open it and maybe it might be damaged after a few uses unless you are very careful.The leathery part already seems to be a but worn after a few uses.  2) Its a little tough to use the slide button at the bottom, the case does have an opening for it but if you don't have nails it a little tough to dig your hands underneath and use it.  3) The mistake I did was buying the red color one. On the computer it looked to be a pleasant red but once I got it ,it seemed a bit too bright , so it is slightly distracting. It takes the attention away from the kindle itself. :(  4) Cost seems to be on the higher side considering all the pros and cons.  5) Kindle is not as light anymore. The weight is now that of a diary    Final take    Not a bad buy if you just want the kindle to be protected from dust and accidental damage and if you  don't really care about the extra weight but please ensure you choose the color carefully unlike me.. Bright may not always be good:)",3,1

"The Kinter Mini MP3 FM player has a display, remote and Headphone output.  The player is in a sturdy metal case (1.45x3.09x3.07) with no mounting flange and no rubber feet.  The unit is supplied without a power supply and without a battery for the remote.  The MP3 player has a bright display and remembers the track being played and the volume setting. There is a power button on the rear panel.  No manual is supplied.  Since the remote did not have a battery, which is unusual, the unit was probably previously used.<br /><br />The unit arrived in approximately 8 days in working order.<br /><br />The FM player is programmed by selecting FM mode with the remote and then pressing the pause/play button.  After that the stations are selected by entering a two digit code.  The FM player has good performance and will bring in strong local stations.<br /><br />The MP3 player equalization settings are mostly not useful due to digital saturation overloading the output.  The EQ 2 setting is the only EQ setting free of saturation and lowers the already inadequate bass response.  The player response in EQ 0 is down 6dB at about 127 Hz.  The player would be acceptable in an environment with lots of low frequency noise, where low frequency response is not needed.  For an environment free of low frequency noise, an accessory equalizer and amplifier will be needed with this player.  Using a Pyramid SEA-2500X preamp with the bass set at 3:00 o’clock and the MID at 1 o’clock is a good starting point.  I prefer to set the MID frequencies on the Pyramid SEA-2500X to 9:00 o’clock with this device.  The output of the Pyramid SEA-2500X preamp must then be sent to an amplifier of your choice and then to speakers, or to a headphone amplifier.  The Pyramid preamplifier will tailor the output of the Kinter Mini MP3 FM player to personal taste and correct the lack of low frequency response.",3,1

"Very disappointed in the sound quality,I purchased these due to them being cheaper than the work tunes, well, you get what you pay I guess, although the volume can be turned up louder than the work tunes, the sound quality is not nearly as good, and absolutely NO A.M stations come in, so, impossible to listen to my news or football games, I won't buy these again,I'll pay a few bucks more and stick with the worktunes",3,2

For some reason GROM thinks it is ok to run the cable to the glove box. That is insane, if you close the glove box you will pinch the cable, if you leave the iPhone inside the glove box, how will you use other features like the GPS? They keep mentioning ipod in their support answers, seems like this is what they have in mind, ipod use, not IPHONE.    In any case the Mazda CX-7 center console actually leaves a space when you close the lid. It is made to have cables running thru from inside. But in order to run the cable all the way here you will need the additional 15ft cable.    Other than that the device works great",3,1

She got it on some sort of a flash sale for around $40 so I am not as dissappointed as I would have been had she paid full price.  The radio does function as stated and gives the weather.  However the product itself is dissappointing.  With 10 years of radio communication and weather instrument technology, programming handheld devises and radios is relatively easy.  However the controls on this unit are difficult to operate.<br /><br />To be honest, I like the item, at a lower cost or on sale  it is worth the buy, however I would look elsewhere if the cost is anywhere above $50.",3,1

"Sound quality is a bit less than a radio station, much less than cd quality.  Setting it to INTL so that you can get to the lower frequencies is a must, or static will be an issue.  For pod casts, does the trick, but music leaves a bit to be desired, I have had 8 track tapes sound better.  Also, it will shut down if the volume for the song is not high enough because it thinks the mp3 player is turned off.  I am using it with a sansa clip[[ASIN:B002MAPS6W SanDisk Sansa Clip+ 8 GB MP3 Player (Black)]] and to avoid continuous shut offs I leave it plugged into the charger at all times while using the iTrip.",3,2

"The price was cheap, and the 5 parts that did work were worth it.  The plug-in wall charger portion failed miserably.  Thankfully, there's lots of spare phone chargers out there that are compatible with the Sansa Fuze+, unlike the older Sansa players which had weird hookups.  You may not even need the charger hookups if you have spare phone chargers lying around.    The \\""purple\\"" silicone skin is more of a pink, so if you have a gender-biased color perception, don't get this for boys.  But if you put this on the purple or blue Sansa Fuze+, you're sure to get a general purple feel.  Mine's black and it comes out to a slightly pink'ish lavender.  Suitably enough purple for me.  The power button is a little tough to turn on and off through the silicone skin, but I'm satisfied.  Also the touchpad of the Fuze+ is a little covered in the lower right and left corners by the curve of the silicone skin.  Still it's fully functional.    With the Universal LCD screen protector, be sure that once you take off the protective films on both sides that you do NOT let it touch anything but the screen immediately.  Take the Sansa Fuze+ out of the silicone protector before doing this.  Treating this like the delicate process it is will ensure a clean and well-protected screen.",3,1

"I bought this in order to make a tidy installation of my Garmin GPS, which it did.  However, I do think that the molded plastic node on the cable which connects the regulator box to the GPS is a drawback.  This node is only inches back from the micro-USB connector and may cause difficulty in some installations.  If you are hoping to fish the micro-USB connector & cable through a descreetly placed small hole, you probably won't have enough slack to connect the plug to your GPS.  In my case, I had to remove several pieces of trim inside my truck in order to have a large enough gap to snake the plug & node through.  Afterwards I was able to glue the plastic node behind the bracket which holds the GPS.  Many folks may not have this option and might find this plastic node unsightly.  Otherwise, this product comes with no instructions.  This didn't present and problems for me as I am an electrician, others may wish for some guidence.  Without instuctions there's no way to determine if a fuse is recommend ahead of the regulator box.  I chose the safe route and fused the positive wire going into the regulator box.  With the GPS turned on, the draw from the vehicle supply is slightly more than 1/3 Ampere.",3,2

"I own a Mini Cooper Convt. and wanted to be able to have bluetooth capability as well as NAV without dash mounting. I searced extensivly for a good head unit. I bought it online (not through and authorized Kenwood dealer) and had it professionally installed along with the Kenwood 510 NAV and the Bluetooth unit (both sold seperately) it was amazing. I was so pleased until the trouble started. I had the touchscreen freeze up many times and not calibrate. I called the online store that I bought it at and they instructed me to have the unit removed and send it back to them for repair. Problem is that now I had to pay to uninstall and re install once they fixed it. I went to a local AUTHORIZED KENWOOD dealer and had them look at it. They were able to get it working to the point that I did not have to take it out for repair. That worked well for about 1 year and then the touchscreen went out completely. Ughh the frustration....I went back to the dealer and had it removed and sent out to repair and it will be fixed by a Certified Tech for Kenwood. Come to find that if you purchase through a NON Authorized Dealer, the warranty is different. I will also purchase my next head unit with my AMEX as they automatically double the warranty! I will say that when the unit is working, it is one of the best that you can buy. I would suggest this unit to anyone as it is quite nice that if you are in a bad area, when you turn the car off it will tuck back into the dash and appear like a stock radio. Also, with the 7\\"" screen and the Garmin software in the NAV it makes driving a whole lot of fun!",3,1

"I bought this box to replace my 2-15\\"" box so I could get more leg room.  The specs said it would go down to 30Hz.  No way.  It has more bass than I thought, but it doesn't push it.  Don't expect hard, slamming bass from this box.  The only thing I was impresssed with was its ability to take alot of power.  I put 75 watts of hard bass to it and it took it, but didnt really shake the floor and windows like my 15's did, and yes, I expected that.  The biggest problem was that the speakers aren't tuned to the box, like most of these boxes.  If you take these speakers out & put them in a box 3 times bigger, you'd have a great sounding speaker.  The manufacturer obviously did not tune this box.  They just threw the speakers into it, added some tweeters, ports, and wired it.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I really want a slim box for a regular cab pickup with some bass, but I guess I'm outa luck.",3,2

"after speaking with an mppt (Maximum Power Point Tracking) tech support for 30 minutes on the mppt technology and prices to wattage ratios I am convinced this unit cannot change 24v input to a 12v output by raising current to the 12v battery. Mppt controllers have three distinct charging stages: bulk, acceptance, and float and have indicator L.E.D.s for these stages. I needed a specific capacity mppt based on my array open voltage bench test numbers.  I would use this Instapark 30amp for connecting several 12v panels in parallel because it handles higher amperage than most low priced pwm controllers; eliminating a controller for each panel could save some money.",3,2
"The Rated size of a speaker used to mean the size of the speaker cone itself......maybe things have changed? These speakers measure only about 5\\"" (including the rolled edge) I was really disappointed when I took them out of the package. Just because they have a large enough metal area around the speaker with a variety of mounting hole patterns, does NOT qualify them as 6.5\\"" speakers in my mind. My original front door speakers (95 Toyota Camry) are 6.75\\"" speakers, but you can mount most 6.5\\"" speakers fairly easily. However, they do sound pretty decent, as long as you aren't expecting any bass from them.......but that's why we have subwoofers :-)",3,2

This is a sad day...as I decided to return the Hifiman HM-901. This is a fantastic sounding player but an absolute mess to operate. I have had a FIIO X3 for about two years and I love that player for the money. The sound quality is very good but I was looking for something better. I've been an audiophile for more than 25 years and these portable players have really caught my attention lately.<br /><br />After a lot of reading I decided to go with the HM-901 solely for the sound quality. (I may need to try the upcoming FIIO X7 and or the LH Labs Geek Wave) After using this player for just under a week I cannot stand to use it anymore. I loaded the latest firmware 2.002 and it is just very clunky to use. The center wheel responds very poorly to inputs and especially when fast forwarding or rewinding any tracks. Boot time is very long (maybe 20-30sec). The buttons and switches on the unit are not very representative of a $1000 unit. The headphone connector does not seem very solid or have a very positive connection and seems as though it could wear out quickly. (This connector is very solid on the X3 and for reference I have used my X3 nearly every day for the last two years and is still very excellent) The HM-901 has made an abundance of popping noises when tracking up or down or stopping and starting various tracks. This is really a shame because it simply sounds FANTASTIC!,3,1

I have been using it a few days now with no serious problems.  So if you looking for a simple replacement that works this unit is for you.<br />Now the bad.  First the user guide that came with the unit is not the correct one.  I search the internet and found the user guide (8000II) at the FLYAUDIO Corp web site.  The radio came in a plain white box with no markings (not even a model / serial number) and no warranty card or instructions on how to register it.  There is no contact information (phone or otherwise) in the box or within the owners manual.  I went to the SimpleSoft Web site and there is warranty information, but no instructions on how to use it if needed.  There is no information anywhere on how to update maps.  There is a forum for owners, but it appears to be abandon as there has been no activity since Sep. 2012 and no response to posts I made.  I have tried the email address as listed in other reviews and I did get a reply. They do provide limited assistance this way.<br /><br />So if you are looking for a good buy and are willing to take a risk on a \\""as is\\"" radio replacement this one is for you.  I am keeping mine because it does what it says it will do, but I have little hope of any help if it breaks, or doing updates to the GPS.",3,1

"You get what you pay for.  The subs and enclosure are great build quality and great sound.  The price for just this is unbeatable.

The whole setup also comes with a wiring kit which again is lacking big time as well, don't even bother with it at all just buy it separately.  If you buy this set just do it for the subs/box which is still a great deal, just plan on a better amp and wiring kit.  In all honesty I would buy again just got my hopes up a bit and then crashed down.  Well after writing this review the subs crashed and burned but due to my own mistake using a too strong of an amp and blowing a speaker pretty easily.  I take back what I said about the amp because I did not have it grounded correctly and worked like a charm.  The box it self is all I have left after selling the amp for 40 bucks.

"Bought one of these within a few days of it becoming available, figuring it would be an all-around upgrade to my Baofeng UV-B5.<br />Before last weekend (when beta CHIRP support was added), I would have rated the radio one star.  Factory programming software is clunky to the point that it's silly. K3NXU and PD0AC both report relatively good sensitivity, but at least where I am (suburb of Seattle), the radio feels somewhat deaf compared to my UV-B5.  Biggest upgrade is probably the scan speed, which is about 4-5 a second on the TERMN-8R.<br /><br />This radio is definitely versatile, but the interface is very clunky. Receiving air band and SWL are a totally different mode from the main interface. With the right antenna, it might actually receive some SW broadcasts, but don't expect to hear anything but promising static with the stock antenna - no surprise there.<br /><br />For this radio's $140, you can buy two UV-B5s, an RTL-SDR dongle for airband/general listening, and a dedicated SWL radio that will actually receive something.

I would not recommend anyone buy this expecting the AV to work. (AV did not work with a 3rd Gen Nano) If you need expand your charging flexibility it is useful.  Consider AV functionality a pleasant surprise should it work.  I ended up having to buy an IOgear IPOD authorized cable for $[...] bucks.  But we can now charge the ipod in the car.,3,2
not all of the ones  I bought worked correctly.  the ones that did rock. more stupid words to writes now,3,2
"They asked more specific about the product was unmatched with the description, I send it  to Lei Bernie that are<br /> 1. According to the product description on Amazon.com, the product can work with no battery for 30 days while parking, but the product manual says only about 3 minutes after the power is off, which is a big difference; in addition, there is no description about its usage at night as well, and it simply looks like a different product.<br /><br />2. In regard to the SD card, no matter it needs or not, or which type of the SD card is needed, the information should be mentioned in the product description, so that it could help the customer buy a workable  product, even it needs to be paid separately, since the customer has the right to know!<br />but Nobody answered me, WHY!!!",3,2
"Great little speaker, works perfectly and has a fantastic sound and look. For some reason the manufacturer put the buttons on backwards. The next/volume up is on the left, while the previous/volume down is on the right. Not a huge deal, but confusing nonetheless.",3,1
"I combined this sun shade with the Glare Stomper 320 Sun Shade.  By attaching the Velcro from the Glare Stomper 320 to the GPS Sun Shade, I had an easy detachable unit.  The controls on the Garmin are completely accessible. I also added the voice of Homer Simpson to my Garmin nuv(r) 255w.  Just got back from a 5,000mile plus trip, was able to see Garmin screen in any condition, and had a blast listening Homer.  Combined, this is a 10 star unit",3,1
Its ok but doesnt solidly fit on screen an constantly seems to peel off my mirror screen. But it does cover the ipod button although it leaves the bottom underneath it wide open.,3,2
what games are compatible with this monitor,3,1
"when you snap it on, you should be pretty careful that the next move does not snap the holder off!<br />Have not yet tried it in my car, in working conditions.",3,2
Works great,3,1
"Well I hope I am not one of the unlucky ones, but so far, not good!!<br /><br />Actually the install did go quite easy, but I do have issues as the unit is not working right.  I installed this on a 2011 Chevy Silverado LTZ.  The issues I have are as follows:<br /><br />1.  The radio works well, sounds good etc.etc.<br />2.  When I switch to XM I have no volume.  It shows song playing, shows I have good signal, but no volume.  I wasn't aware I had to plug in any other jacks to get volume on XM to work, but I suppose I will have to take it out and see what is going on.<br />3.  When I load a CD it only goes in 3/4 of the way and stops.  I have tried multiple Cd's with no luck.<br />4.  When I turn the blinker on the noise you normally hear has become 3 times louder. It is very annoying.  Not sure what happened there, but will have to investigate.<br />5.  Engine light pops on and off at times.<br />6.  I think that is it, but I do feel I am missing another issue.  If anyone has any answers or advice to my above problems I would appreciate feedback and THANK YOU in advance.<br /><br />Pat",3,1

"I just bought from amazon vendor my freestyle 2gb blue player and i only used one in the pool and the second time i used some lines came up making impossible to read the music or settings in the player. Also a little black spot came up and now is no longer in good use.    When i used i loved because i was able to listen to my favorite music under water. The headphones were not great to my small ears , they kept falling and i used my goggles strap to hold them still. I hope the customer service will provide me with a feedback and fix it so i can use again. So far i can only give 3 stars since is no longer good..     I will update once they fixe it. 2008-11-24    2008-12-20  I received my new freestyle and love it. It works perfectly ! I bought a new headphone from other company and now i can swimm easy for 40 min and having fun.  Great deal!!",3,1
"Case cover fits the phone perfectly.  However, it did not take long for the outer layer of the cover to start peeling off.",3,1
"the charges work but are made of cheap material, not sure how much longer they will last. I hope I am wrong about them becuase I hate buying chargers.",3,2
arrived quickly and they work!,3,1
It was delivered quickly but I didn't recieve all the parts. I got 13 parts. the part I'm missing is the screen protector so I wasn't worried about trying to send it back over that. And in the descrition it only has 14 parts listed unless I missed one three times but the parts I got were good quality.,3,2
"The EZ-FIND arrived ahead of the expected date and overall was as advertised. However, the application to provide a beep at the remote device on a cat was not what I was nooking for. I was afraid the beeping  would scare the cat into running and I would not know where it went. Does work on a TV remote in the house so was not a wasted purchase. I am trying different products for cats outdoors.",3,2
"It has good sound for such a small speaker, it was easy to set up, it's great for the price.",3,1
Great set of accessories for the price.  I haven't used the belt clip because I don't trust that it will remain secure enough and not tear through the silicone skin.  If I did it over again I'd just get the skin and the screen protector.  But for the price you can't beat it.,3,1
is working fine.<br />but not as good as original.<br />Endurance is aprox. 25% less. But Good price.<br />Shipping was as good.<br />Would do it again.,3,1
very good music player but a pain for videos must convert video recorder is good,3,1
"I received my clear pouch in the mail the other day. I opened the package (which involved just pulling apart some adhesive), and the pouch was a bit marked up. I wouldn't even classify it as \\""defective.\\"" It just looks dirty. It's a shame, considering I picked the clear pouch (the more pricey of the cheap bunch). No bother though in the long run. It's about to get much dirtier once I go outside. I was just a little bummed. Other than that, the sensor looks safe and sound. I would recommend this product for the price!",3,1
Great little light and works very well with the M-Edge Latitude Jacket but it burns through batteries much faster than I think it should.,3,1
So I hooked these up in my 2008 Tundra underneath my rear driver side seat and they sound ok.  The flex when it pounds requires atleast 2.5 inches between carpet and sub.  My subwoofer is a 12&#34; shallow subwoofer.  I placed a three quarter inch plate to lift the box up and it sounds alot better once I did that.,3,2
It works but comes with very poor documentation.<br />It has a free website (www.sky200.com) where you<br />can register the device. The site will give you the<br />current position as well as a playback of the last<br />few days of data. The website is a bit flaky and<br />sometimes features don't work 100% of the time.<br /><br />You can get a manual for SMS commands at<br />  http://www.eelink.com.cn/uploads/datasheet/GPS_TRACKER_OPERATION_COMMANDS(D).pdf<br /><br />I might try to get this to work with opengps.,3,1
"I purchased this product because it uses a \\""USB cable\\"" for charging. I mistakenly tried to use mini-USB cable and it did not fit. Turns out it's micro-USB. My apologies for any confusion. BlueAnt should specify the USB cable is micro-USB where it plugs into the unit. Other than that the unit works fine.",3,2
"I used two of the set of four on both my car and house key chains, and I tested them a few times, by throwing them on the lawn, then walking around to beep for them and to hear how loud they would be. It was a moderate success... if there are not too many noises in the immediate neighborhood, the chirp is audible.<br />In the house, when the doors are closed, even if they chirp, it is hard to hear them, unless one is already in the same room. That could be difficult for somebody who is not sure at all where they saw them last, because if you don't know where to start, you can't hope to hear the chirp from a distance.<br />Finally, after a few weeks, they started to \\""snare\\"" constantly. I managed to shake or slap the key bundle and that would stop the little rattly noise. The first time this happened while driving, I thought something was wrong with my car's dashboard, then I realized it was the key finder dangling from the ignition...<br />After they finish the spontaneous rattling phase, which will last about 5 weeks, they simply go silent. In other words, those lithium battery coins last about 3 months total, not a good efficiency. I replaced the coins with fresh ones, but the darn little things never turned themselves back on.<br />So much for that. I am not going to make a reclamation, it is not worth my time, and I won't buy another set.",3,2
Two thumbs up,3,1
"I got this item extremely fast. The only problem that I had with it is that the tabs they give you to pull off the top and bottom layers with would not come off. they ripped and I had to struggle to get them off without ruining the screen protector. Other than that, they look great and now so does my iPod!",3,1
"Works OK for what I paid ~ $12.00 delivered to my home.  Main use is for listening to downloadable audio books.  Volume control is strictly from the broadcasting device, no volume control on speaker itself.  Music is listenable, but has very limited, at best, bass response and volume output.  This is, after all, a tiny device, and anyone expecting full range musical reproduction and volume levels should look elsewhere.  Bluetooth range appears to be about 15' without obstructions.  Turned on unit after charging and paired with my iPhone after a few seconds. No buttons to push.  Includes a small carry pouch and USB cable for recharging, but no power cube, so you need to provide your own or plug it into your computer.  It came packaged in an unnecessarily convoluted container.  To save some frustration, cut the tape that binds the clear top to the white base, then twist slightly to separate those two pieces.  Then grab the top where the speaker is held captive and slightly twist the very bottom about 1/8 revolution to release bottom lid where paperwork, carry pouch, and USB cable are stored.  Then depress the two arrow &#34;catches&#34; and pull apart the two cylinder sides.",3,2
"Really annoying to use with a life proof case. It has to line up exactly and there is most certainly a learning curve...even then, it's really just a pain to use daily. That's really my biggest complaint since as far as it actually working - it serves the purpose of letting me use my docking station instead of a cable. I've been using it still a cpl months later because i really don't know what else i would use.",3,1
"My husband is a truck driver, and he is constantly climbing in and out of his truck. So I needed something that would protect his phone if it fell. I have an Otter Box, but he refused to spend as much money on his because his phone was older. I only paid $15 for the product, and I would have to say it is well worth the money. The clip that holds it on his waste fell apart, but we didn't mind because that was not the reason we bought it. Also there is a plastic insert on the inside of the cover that we removed because it caused his screen protector to come up at the edges. For the most part I was satisfied with the product especially for the amount I purchased it for.",3,2
"It has a very good picture, it has easy to use software (you can see where you are when you're driving.... you can export part of the clip so you don't have a huge file...).  I haven't used the WiFi or the Security features, so I can't comment on them.<br /><br />I like the mount a lot.  It's easy to take the unit out to pull the memory card out, and the mount is basically infinitely adjustable with respect to angle, so it should mount on anything, even a back window.<br /><br />I have to dock it one or two stars for at least the following reasons:<br />1) Even at the minimum sensitivity g-sensor ratings, the device triggers \\""events\\"", for all kinds of bumps.  This means that you have tons of small files even if you set the clip length to 3 minutes.  You don't lose data, but it's a pain to go through all the files.  If you have a really soft riding car, this might not be a problem for you, but it is for me.<br />2) I also think it is overpriced, but these things will get cheaper over time.",3,1
"This product is basically what I was looking for, so overall I'm glad I purchased it. I only have one complaint -- it's a little too easy to 'unlock' it so that the tilt position can be moved. I wish it was more difficult to tap that button.",3,1
"I like this cover, and the side angle works well, but when using the upright angle, the tablet falls over.",3,1
"Not quite what I was hoping for, but it will work",3,2
"For the price, I guess I can't complain.  It works well and is very easy to use.  However, the clamps that hold the iPod to the mount broke after only a couple months (and very infrequent use) and now I have to use a rubberband to hold the iPod in - tacky, but functional.",3,2
This Creative Zen is not as nice as the Zen Mosaic.  Controls a little more difficult to use but it works fine and for the price is acceptable.,3,1
"Bought it for the HTC Evo 4g and it the fit is just too tight.  You can jam it in there, but after sweating into the armband through a workout, I find it really difficult to get my phone out again.  So, it is not the answer for the Evo!  It is definitely not a universal case; probably perfect for iPhone/iPod (the holes for the plugs look like they line up well for those; def not for the Evo).  I will continue to use it while waiting for something else to come out, but am looking for a better case.",3,2
"This cover did indeed protect my Kindle from water, sand, and sunscreen while I was vacationing at a beach resort. On the downside, the 5-way control toggle button did not work very well while in the cover (I tend to use this button a lot), you cannot access the on/off switch on the top of the kindle without unvelcroing the cover and taking the unit out partway, and the thin cover offers little protection for the kindle while traveling. The cover also fit very snuggly, making it inconvenient to take the kindle in/out of the cover. Bottom line:  this cover is fine for casual beach/pool-side reading, especially if you do not use the toggle button often. I would not make this my only jacket, however, due to the lack of protection and other reasons I stated above. Now that M-edge has recently introduced the Leisure jacket, I will buy that and retire the OCTO Splash proof case. From its description, the Leisure jacket appears to address the shortfalls of the OCTO splash proof case - - but I'll test drive it first and let you know if it's worth buying over the OCTO case.",3,1
"I would have to say that it's decent for the few dollars I payed for it. It protects the back of the ipod good enough so it doesn't get scratched. It will, at most, hold you over until you can afford a better one.",3,1
"I have ordered 6 of these now, (not from this same seller), & they just are not made like the real deal. Im going to the Apple store because these simply are made for the price they go for. Every 5 minutes my iPhone says (while charging with this USB set) is that it's not supported by the device. It's silly so I just threw it away cause it's too cheap to make a fuss about. Im going to Apple tomorrow  :)",3,2
Nice and bright. Looks as pictured. Does not stay on ipod very well. More fashionable than functionable,3,1
"The GPS function takes what feels like forever to connect. The light flashed red and blue until the GPS is fully connected, sucks at night (very bright light). Sometimes it never connects to GPS, but normally takes over ten minutes. For the price, it works fine. I have noticed that the camera hangs off level now that it has been in use for a few months. The video is all crooked now. Don't use the GPS function, not worth it.",3,2
"This product is good protection for keeping the screen from getting scratches, but there is still some glare on the screen.  My mom has a Kindle and it is non glare without the protective cover.",3,1
"I have had this unit for about 4 years now.  I have 2, one in each vehicle. I absolutely love the sound.  I have no problems with that part.  My beef comes with the NAV system.  The maps are old and it doesn't really find what your looking for.  The maps are NOT update-able, Well honestly they are but they never put out any updates. I tried for years to look for updates and never found any.  I even went to the Alpine site and they didn't have any.  I got one update when i first got the unit but none since.  If the NAV system was updated and I could actually find where i was going this unit would be awesome.  If something your looking for has been around for a while then it will take you straight to it.  but if you're looking for new roads or establishments, forget it.  The unit tends to lock up if you push too many buttons back to back too fast.  so when selecting things make sure you take your time. If you buy this unit buy it for the sound quality not the NAV system. I bought mine for the sound quality and not the NAV system, that's why I give it the 3 stars, the two star minus comes from the NAV system.  It's not worth the money if your really wanting NAV.",3,2
"I NEEDED ONE THAT WAS MORE WEATHER PROOF FOR MY MOTORCYCLE.  I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THAT AT THE TIME OF THE PURCHASE, MY MISTAKE, BUT I GAVE IT TO SOMEONE WHO NEEDED ONE AND HE WAS REAL HAPPY WITH IT.",3,1
"I am satisfied, poor quality product.",3,1
"First of all this rating of a 3 has to do with the quality of product not the seller. They did a fine job of packing, shipping and it arrived in a timely manner.  What I didn't care for is that it is little more than a flimsy piece of plastic and provides no real protection for your Ipod other than to reduce scratches.  Concidering the price, it really is a case of getting what you paid for.  I don't feel that the seller decieved me, but the photo and the description should mention the thinness of the cover.",3,1
"Okay, I bought this because it is a cambridge, I had high hopes for it. I thought this was going to be comparable to the jawbone jambox, which has really good sound and is quite loud for it's small size, it's also over twice the price as the Oontz. With that being said, I am not unhappy with the oontz, it does have really good, clear sound and is fine for listening to music in the living room or basement, works well for tablets or a speaker for watching movies on your laptop, easy to use, bluetooth connects quickly. If you're looking for something to compete against the jambox, you'll more than likely be dissapointed, but for the money it isn't a bad buy.",3,1
This case is OK for the price.  I use it as a backup (or extra) because I wanted one that was more refined.  I wound up buying one from Case-Mate that was exactly what I wanted.,3,1
"This is a very bulky mount. It should work with any phone, but it feels kind of cheap. I replaced mine with a different mount. My mom still uses hers. It gets the job done, but it isn't anything special. I wouldn't buy it again.",3,2
Easy to install but doesn't get best reception. Would recommend in an urban environment,3,1
"It's nice that it charges everything or at least the USB cord does, I haven't tried out the wall charger or the car charger yet, though I'm a bit scared to after the reviews I've read about it breaking my Zune. However, it's not exactly as advertised. It is NOT a ZUNE product, it's an after market made product so it does not recognize it on the computer. It will charge it, but you cannot sync anything to your Zune from your Collections, which kind of sucks. So don't get it if you're wanting a back up cord you can use to sync your Zune.",3,2
"Looks great on your arm and feels comfortable, but the fabric which holds the case to the armband fell apart in about 4 months.  Also, my arms are not that huge, but it is barely long enough to fit around my arm.",3,2
the case in the picture IS NOT the case they give to you. however they do send you a fairly sturdy and signifigantly well fitting case. the only problems with the case is that there really isnt access to the hold switch from the top since the lanyard goes through the top of the case also the screen is NOT PROTECTED. that is where they flat out lied about the product (hence the 3 star rating). i was glad to see that there was a belt loop (not clip) but its still to small to fit an actual belt through it. the case was good just not the advertising but i guess that what i get for buying from a 3rd party carrier that only claims to have certain products...,3,2
Its good,3,1
"I have the QYT KT8900 version and programmed via a lead and the software, it works fine but if you're really struggling to program manually Google...Miklor KT8900...you should see a link to the Miklor website showing how to program it.",3,1
I put it in my armpit and it slid out and hit the cement on the corner and cracked the screen and damaged the corner badly. So it wasn't the ultimate in protection.,3,2
"Nice pair of tvs,but the one doesn't come on. It has power to it , but makes a weird whiney noise when trying to turn on the unit. The head phones are decent and the controllers are of Good quality. I just wish I could have both tvs working.",3,1
Didn't exactly fit I liked but still gets the job done. Still able to use it without any problems and feel safe with it on there.,3,1
Only gave a 3 star because the flashlight seemed used,3,2
"It works but it's very heavy, and the neck has a hard time staying where you position it. The metal makes me nervous about scratches sometimes.",3,1
"Bought in October 2014<br /><br />When the iPad mini fell down, the white cable that was charging it broke and left a tip inside my iPad. Not happy at all.<br />It wasn't the cable that actually broke, it was the white little piece (lighting) that goes inside the ipad.<br /><br />The black cable still works fine, but I'm extra careful since the incident with the white one.",3,2
i received the first one and it was broken so they sent me another and it did not work but i think i have other issues with the iphone so i just took it in and upgraded to a new one,3,1
I really liked the length of this cable. It broke after about 3 uses. Hopefully the replacement is better. :/,3,2
"This product set up with minimal hassle and paired with my bluetooth headphones with a couple minutes of fiddling.    As one reviewer noted, it does lack in bass and is a little bit tinny in sound quality, but it's totally adequate if you aren't picky and just want to listen to some music or a podcast.  My only real issue with it is that you cannot adjust the volume with the ipod when it is plugged in; presumably it broadcasts at a set volume, and you are meant to adjust on whatever receiver you are using.  My bluetooth headphones don't have a volume control, so this is a little bit of a bummer.  The music is always just a liiiiiittle bit louder than I would like.",3,1
"For the cheap price, this item is OK and works as described. However, where it plugs into the unit, the charging pin is loose and the unit powers off sometimes if I hit a bump or when handling the phone. I have to leave the phone on the seat and not move it. It's not a defective unit...it's the way the thing is made.",3,2
This item arrived with a crack in the top right next to the button. If the crack was underneath where it couldn't be seen as easily I would have dealt with it but now I'm looking into getting a refund and getting a new one. It's all plastic and uses three AAA batteries to power it. To get to where the batteries are held you need to take the front of the light off. there's a small lever on the bottom that needs to be lifted up and after that it pops right off. It uses three LED lights and is decently bright. Probably not enough to light the way if it's pitch black outside but good for being seen by cars.,3,2
"Except for the fact that this was 120 gigs, not 160 gigs - I am happy with the oroduct because it works great. It was also kept in a case so it is in decent condition.",3,1
"It doesn’t really matter which “brand” name you see this little dashboard cam listed under here on Amazon.com, they are all the same. You get a front camera with a small LCD screen to view the action and see the menu options, a rear view camera, USB cord, Power cord, suction cup and adhesive attachments and a remote control.<br /><br />The cables are plenty long enough to set this up and hide the cables in a standard car (not sure about an SUV).<br /><br />The cameras are cheap plastic units that feel like they could be easily broken. They do rotate so that you can try to get the best angle/view.<br /><br />The instructions are pretty much useless as is the remote control. I found the remote only works to turn the unit off/on, which you do not need since the unit starts with your car and shuts off after the car power turns off.<br /><br />There is NO infrared (IR) ability, even though it is advertised as such.<br /><br />There is supposedly an internal battery, if there is it lasts less then 5 minutes.<br /><br />The unit will not overwrite the files as the instructions say. You actually have to swap out, reformat or empty your SD card when it is full. Otherwise the unit will get in a loop of turning on and immediately turning off (which makes it hard to format the card in the unit at that point.<br /><br />My rear camera kept falling off the window. Adhesive stuck to the window but the camera came away from the adhesive. Had to glue the camera to the adhesive that was still on the window to get it to stay.<br /><br />This does not record in HD. Video quality is often spotty and unfocused. I have had clear results and very bad results with choppy footage and frozen frames.<br /><br />I have mine set for 5 min record time but it will not record more than 1 minute at a time no matter what I do. Sometimes it does not even record at all (missing footage when I go back and review my drive).<br /><br />For the price I will keep it until it dies completely. While I have not had to rely on the footage for any accidents it has captured some of the idiots out there on the highways.<br /><br />It also messes with your radio reception.",3,2
not what I though and it is taking me some time to get it working.,3,1
"Great item for the price, but don't expect a very long lifespan...",3,1
nice little radio just wish that the manual was a little clearer on the functions and programing<br />they need to tell you when you buy it that you need to use a computer to program it<br />but if you need a starter radio this would be a good budget one,3,1
Love the weighted bean bag part of it.  But had trouble with the sticky part on the back of my GPS.  The velcro didn't  want to stick,3,1
"I purchased  the DR500GW-HD, and noticed I lost 5 minutes of video, went from parking mode to an event, and is there a problem with this model? I have the latest firmware update. no one seems to respond to my question or even care. I'm just afraid that when I need that video of a accident, that it was not recording at that time.",3,2
"I ordered this case to go with a GPS I gave as a gift.  I don't know if I just got a bad case, but the zipper is a pain to open and close.  I have to push down on the zipper, while slowly moving the zipper tab around the case.  Maybe with a little use, it will not be so stiff.  Since the case was inexpensive and will provide protection for the GPS, I'm going to give it to my sister anyway.  It's better than nothing.  Not sure I would order it again.",3,2
"This system looks very natural in my car but my steering buttons don't work, it doesn't come with the Camera, and the bluetooth won't sync my contacts from my phone.",3,2
"After I finally got it installed in my 2006 Ford F-150, I tuned it, and it just isn't as loud as i'd like it to be. I can still tolerate it and have it play, but it just doesn't get loud enough for my liking.",3,1
"It is good for the price, but it can be a little staticky. Looking for something cheap, and quick fix this it.",3,1
could hear on it but could not transmit on it.,3,2
"For some reason, this is not compatible with my iPad. Otherwise, love the length and the colours",3,1
it does stay on your wrist but besides that it is a real hassle putting on the ipod and on your wrist. should get another one instead if you have to keep putting on and off.,3,2
"You can spend much more than this on a better foot support, so keeping the budget price in mind, I will only report that this unit is not very durable. The toe lever control is very touchy and place in such a way that is easily tripped, thus unlocking the setting that you've set it to. That's a reasonable annoyance, given that this is an inexpensive product, but within a few months of having it, both toggles holding the toe lever snapped off (they're made of cheap, molded plastic), rendering the lever useless. Now, in order to adjust the support, I have to pick it up, and manually set the locking mechanism from underneath the unit -- and even then then, it pops out of the locked position, periodically. I'm a fairly large person (size 12 feet, 240 lbs), so that's probably a factor, too, but just keep in mind that you'll get what you pay for on this item, and nothing more. Thus, my \\""okay, but...\\"" rating.",3,2
"When you pay around $20 for an entire package of iPod accessories, you don't expect top-notch quality. The \\""leather\\"" case included was actually surprisingly nice, but the rest of the accessories I would estimate will last about a year until they're toast. Overall, a nice little package for the price.",3,1
"Note:  This unit was also sold as a Clarion at one time (identical unit).<br /><br />I found the CRK5 to be moderate in performance, but quite good in SOME installation situations.  For example, those who cannot install a self-enclosed center channel on top of the dashboard may very well take advantage of unused 1/2 DIN stereo spacing in the dash to find a place for this.  Otherwise, it might not be of much use to those without a flat area on the dashboard or spare spacing.<br /><br />I say this because (generally) it is optimal to have the center channel high up along with the L & R speakers.<br /><br />The CRK5 audio was ok for its size, but you must realize these are mini-woofers and the sound is best described as ok, but not great.  Bass response is about what you'd expect: decent midrange, but lower bass is not possible.  Treble/high frequency sounds need adjustment on your equalizer as they weren't that great<br /><br />The CRK5 uses tiny speakers found in many miniature speaker docks for iPods and etc.  The included amplifier is useful if you don't have a spare powered center channel output from an amplifier, but sound quality is average (should be ok for center channel signals, however).<br /><br />I did like the metal grill on the front of the unit, and that the speakers were aimed upward slightly, but overall the quality could have been better.  Multiple times I could hear the center channel enclosure resonating during certain audio passages.<br /><br />If you are restricted in terms of space and don't have audiophile-level requirements, I think you'll find the CRK5 helpful.  However, if you require optimal clarity and sound response (as much as you can fit into a tiny space!) I think you'll need to keep on looking.<br /><br />Basically I wish to say you cannot get the same volume or sound quality that you can from other center channel speakers or custom units, but it can fit where others can't.<br /><br />Personally I thought the unit was fair, but originally overpriced at $100+ (but at least you can find it for less on Amazon!)<br /><br />(Reference (audio source):  5.1 audio system with 31-band EQ for each channel (Alpine signal processor).on Amazon!)

These LCD headrests were easy to install and work well but what I don't like about them is that they rattle as you drive.  I find it very annoying.  I have placed apoplectic sleeve around the area to reduce the noise but I can't seam to get rid of it completely.  I would have to remove the insides of the headrests and permanently fix the posts so that they would not rattle.  A better design is needed where they put plastic spacers at the top of the posts and make the posts so that you can tighten them once they are in the right position.,3,2
The case fits on the Ipod 4th generation but it is bulky for the person that uses it more for games.  My son kept it on for a few days and then switched back to his old hard case.  This is more of a novelty than a practical case.,3,1

"26.OCT.2013<br />Last week I put a new shell on my wifes 2008 VW Jetta key.<br />The big learning with that was to make sure I transfered the RFID Imobilizaton capsule from the old shell to the new one.<br />This Volvo Key Head was no different.<br />Matter of fact the Volvo RFID capsule looked very much like the VW RFID capsule.<br />Be careful because the capsule is glass and it is fragile.<br />The surprise for me on this key head is that in order to take the old one apart you need to destroy it.<br />There is a screw to separate the key head from the main body of the key fob.<br />But when it comes time to open the key head to get at the RFID capsule and swap out the cut key, the two halves are glued together.<br />So, I broke out the Dremel and started cutting away.<br />Putting the two halves of the key head back together with the RFID capsule and the old cut key in it took me serveral tries.<br />And what complicated it even more is that when you are almost done, and you start to press the two halves together you will need to put a drop of super glue in the right spot to hold the two halves together.<br />You will get one try to do this correctly, so practice.<br />This whole process is not for someone that is impatient or mechanically challenged.<br />You are going to need a lot of patience, some tools and mechanical know how to be successful.<br />In the end, my key flips out OK and the new key head fit the OEM key body OK.<br />Note: To keep the key head flip release from failing in the first place, make sure you press AND HOLD the button BEFORE you fold the key.",3,2

Unfortunately this does not work with the iPhone 3G.  An earlier review states that it does but perhaps a firmware update has changed this.  I have tried this charger with both my wife's and my own charger and it puts a message on the screen that the charger is not compatible with the phone.  The audio out works fine but it will ask if you want to put the phone into airplane mode.  I would not recommend this for use with an IPhone 3G.,3,2

"The sound quality is very poor if you are connecting a mp3 player. But is good for SD cards and USB's.  The connector is not very good so a slight touch will restart the transmitter and then you again have to set the frequency. It would have been great if the transmitter could retain the frequency setting on restart.   You cant use the mp3 player so using an SD card to an Mp3 player makes it difficult as it goes back to the start of your playlist after every restart of the transmitter. So even for stopping the car at a gas station, you have to listen the songs from the start or manually go to the selected song.",3,2
"Its a good product, the only problem is that it needs more support for the stand. That's my only consern with this product.",3,1
"Not the most amazing case out there, but it's very thin, fairly durable (just one small crack in mine, but I've been pretty rough on it), and protects the back and sides of the iPod sufficiently.  If you're looking for something minimal just to make you feel a little better about slipping your iTouch into your pocket or lightly dropping it once in a while, it's a good enough case.",3,1

"This is the third Garmin handheld GPS that I have owned. My previous model was the GPSMap 76csx which I was very pleased with. I purchased 78sc a little over a week ago and have used it on land and on the water. My primary reason for the purchase was to use it on the water with my boat to mark coastal fishing spots in the Tampa Bay area.    Overall this is a very nice unit. Satellite acquisition is the fastest I have ever seen. The Blue chart software and City Navigator work well with the unit. Many option selections within to choose from and the color screen is vivid.    Now the rest of the story. To say battery life is poor would be an understatement. I am using Sanyo Ni-MH Enloope rechargeables in the 78sc. I also use these same batteries in my Nikon D300 digital camera (w/power winder).In the Nikon these batteries give me over 800-1000 shots and last weeks. Enloopes are an excellent rechargeable battery and sold by Amazon. Last evening I put the fully recharged Enloopes in the 78sc. This morning when I went to use the GPS the batteries were down to 1 of 4 bars.Too low to fully light the screen. Fortunately I have the Garmin 12 volt cord so was able to use it on the boat. Had I not had that cord the GPS would have been useless.This makes no sense to me.    Garmin literature states that battery life with Ni-MH batteries is UP TO 20 hrs. That may be but that has not been my experience so far. My \\""work around\\"" for this battery issue will be to (1)Use the unit via 12 volt battery while on the boat. (2) Fully charge the batteries the night before use and insert them only the day of use. It's really too bad to have to resort to these measures for such an expensive handheld unit but I see no other option other than to return the unit.    IMHO this is one case where the one bad feature really outweighs all the other nice features.",3,1
"The great thing about this package is you get a hard case, a screen protector, small cleaning cloth, and a pouch.      The pouch is way oversized, but will do if you need something to keep your nano, headphones, and whatever else all bundled together.  The screen protector is an excellent fit with very simple application steps, and does not distort the screen at all.      The case itself fits very tightly, though I did notice that it presses ever so slightly on the screen as evidenced by the dark spot and subsequent pock marks on the screen protector.  The lock switch is a little tricky for big fingers which required that I use a finger nail to switch it on/off.  There is an opening for docking, though I doubt that it will fit all docking stations.  As with most all cases of this type it will collect scuffs and scratches VERY easily, but your nano is protected from the worst abuse; however, it will be susceptible to dust and small particles entering the case.    Overall, a reasonable value given the included items.",3,1
"This item is ok but does not give the usual full volume output. I have tried the micro cassettes in other recorders with similar results. Only one of the 3 in the package gives full volume, perhaps the other tapes are partially demagnetized or have been in storage too long. I am pleased with the seller's prompt shipping.",3,1
"Like others who have commented so far, I had an older model Mio 200-series GPS that I had bought at the now dissolved Circuit City, years ago.  Back then, any kind of GPS that actually spoke street names cost at least $300 or more, and that old unit did it at around $180, so back then it was a real bargain.  Unfortunately, they never did come out with a map update for that model, and in Atlanta where new streets appear out of nowhere at times, over time this was a disadvantage.  So on \\""Black Friday\\"", I decided to invest in an updated unit, and bought the R403.<br /><br />I'm repeating again, what others have said, but these are my own observations:<br /><br />ADVANTAGES:<br /><br />Inexpensive considering the features you get for the price, with a decently large screen.  The GPS locks on to a signal reasonably quick, and in terms of accuracy, seems to hit it on the mark pretty well.  The suction cup is much smaller than on the old unit, and I find that using one of the dashboard \\""bean bag\\"" devices is better.  The R403 also offers a \\""lane assist\\"" function that semi-works (though see below). The menu system is updated a bit, and a little easier to use than the sometimes confusing 2XX series.  Keyword here - inexpensive, especially with holiday sales that can bring it as low as $59.00 in some cases.<br /><br />DISADVANTAGES:<br /><br />The lane assist function is quirky.  While it should say something like, \\""Stay in the right lane and turn right on Highway 50\\"", it instead just says, \\""stay right... stay right....\\"", until you've actually made a right turn, and the lane graphic seems to freeze up at some types of intersections and doesn't display lanes the way it should.  In other words, the Mio doesn't have the advanced junction view/assist features that the major brands offer in their more expensive units - this is a cheaper scaled down version and \\""sorta\\"" works.  I've also noticed that the maps are overall accurate but have a few quirks.  My old Mio 2XX actually got my home address right, but the new R403 actually lists my street as though it's name is merged with a street that is on the other side of a 2-lane highway from my street (?).  It still gets me there, and well, I KNOW where I live anyway, but it's an odd quirk because you don't expect maps to get worse with newer incarnations of these - only more and more accurate.<br /><br />Note, there is not a traffic function on this model - Mio has more expensive models with that function.  The button for it does exist in this Mio's menu system, but it's greyed-out and does not function (tease).  There is also not a bluetooth function to connect to your cell phone, so if this is an important feature for you, you'll need to go to a higher model.  Last and more picky - you can't pick the voice; it has the same robotic female voice the old 2XX series had.  It would be nice to have a choice of voices.<br /><br />Conclusion:  Ok, I bought the R403 at a retail location on Black Friday and also had a coupon, so I paid $59.00 for it.  For THAT price, I can easily overlook the disadvantages listed above.  At Amazon's $89.00 price, I'd say the R403 under normal conditions is still ok for that price, but during the holiday season LOTS of GPS units are on all kinds of sales, so shop around Amazon's other models first before ordering - you might find more features in a less quirky design for only slightly more.  I give it 3 stars - you could do worse (cough cough TomTom), but you can perhaps do better if you research a bit, too.actually lists my street as though it's name is merged with a street that is on the other side of a 2-lane highway from my street (?).

"The camera is GREAT!!  There is about a 1.5 second delay when you put the car in reverse and the camera comes on.  Very crisp and detailed picture.  It more than meets my expectations.  The GPS on the other hand takes 5 or 6 minutes to find the satellites and the maps are very antiquated.  I thought there was something wrong with the GPS, because I was not getting any speed limits in my area.  I called Magellan and complained that I thought it was broken because the speed limits did not show up anywhere and they asked me to watch it for a few more days and if I was still not happy they would send me a new GPS.  I then took a trip to a town about 45 miles away and when I got on the expressway, the speed limit showed up.  It only shows up on very MAJOR thoroughfares.  I live in a small town and I had the speed limits on all my previous GARMIN GPS's.  I guess Magellan just doesn't have it together like GARMIN.",3,2

"My only major gripe is the way the presets are stored, it's a bit complicated and involved requiring going into the menu a few levels.  Also, my car is older and lacks steering wheel controls, so changing to the next track when the CD player or Bluetooth is selected requires the use of the toggle switch behind the large volume button.  It's terrible, difficult to use, awkward to hold and seems to me like a complete afterthought.<br /><br />Thankfully this unit does include a dedicated dimmer input, I believe this is the lowest priced unit in their line up that includes this feature, which I find ridiculous.  I can understand perhaps the lowest offering lacking that input, but for anything &#62; $100, unnacceptable.<br /><br />Other than that, Bluetooth is flawless, the unit looks good and is just a few design flaws in my opinion from being perfect.<br /><br />The lack of buttons - presets in particular, while attractive definitely hurts the day to day usability of this head unit for my particular application.",3,2
"I'm kind of torn on exactly how to rate this beautiful skin from Decal Girl (it doesn't say it's Decal Girl, but that is the name on the skin kit you receive.)  It is lovely and once you've downloaded the coordinating screen saver and installed it, it is beautifully striking, so for that I give it 5 stars.  The downside is, it is very glossy and can be hard on the eyes when reading, especially when using a book light. (-1 star)  Also, it doesn't seem to cover the Nook as completely as the matte finish Decal Girl skin I got for my Kindle (see:  [[ASIN:B0040GJIY4 DecalGirl Protective Kindle Skin (Fits 6\\"" Display, Latest Generation Kindle) Quest (Matte Finish)]]) which covers my Kindle from edge to edge almost perfectly.  (-1 star)  Of course, that could just be due to the different shapes of each device, as the nook is much curvier on the back than the Kindle.  The Matte Finish skin I received is also substantially thicker than the vinyl high gloss version for the Nook and was easier to apply due to being a bit less floppy and less tacky.  (-1 star)  Now, that doesn't mean it will provide protection against drops, as the other reviewer seemed to desire, either skin will really only provide protection from scratches, fingerprints (well, the matte version anyway) and dirt/stains.  If you have a cover, especially those with leather interiors, friction dye-transfer staining can be a problem.  I have experienced this myself on my Nook and have read reviews in other models that confirmed the same issue with other covers.  The skin is a great way to prevent this and keep the device looking pristine.  While I don't recommend this model mainly because of the glare, I did find a matte version available elsewhere on the internet (do a search on Bicycle Chain Skin Nook Matte Finish) and can vouch that it is totally worth the $5 upgrade.",3,1

I had a little trouble getting it to mount, as it is a MICRO card, and a little hard to place in my Garmin 60. So far, I've been able to figure out how to set way points, and I've learned how to back track. I use this to track myself on my ATV, as  do a lot of exploring. Of course none of this has to do with how good the map card itself is, more on the operator and the machine the card is in. So, I suppose it's probably more than adequate for this newbie. It does seem to have most of the oil lease roads and smaller trails, which surprised me. All in all, I've never been disappointed with Garmin products, though they're not always the easiest to use.",3,1
"When this arrived it was obvious that someone else had returned it. The battery in the remote was dead so I replaced the battery. Still, the remote was hit and miss. I wasn't going to go through the headache to return it so I used a screwdriver to remove the radio piece from the bass speaker box. The IR eye that is supposed to receive the remote signal was bent up toward the top of the speaker box. I bent the eye forward and screwed the piece back in place. Everything has worked fine ever since. We use this every day just as a powered subwoofer for a different receiver. We don't use the side speakers but they did work when I tested them. I haven't tried the usb, SD or MP3 features. The FM radio brings in a signal really well though we don't use that either.",3,2

"Speakers were purchased to replace the front set of a 2004 Toyota Sequoia with JBL audio unit... driver's side speaker was partially blown.  Took a great deal of time and effort just to mount the 6-1/2\\"" speakers... had to cut adapter rings from 1/4\\"" plexiglas in order to get them installed... original JBL speakers were a very odd size.  I also had to mount the new tweeters on original brackets after removing JBL tweeters, which were held to bracket by a threaded shaft and nut.  The new BA tweeters had no such mount... used rear-view mirror adhesive to attach them to the bracket.  Did not use the cross-over... original tweeters were driven directly from the audio unit, which must filter out base through a bi-amp.<br /><br />Was it worth all the effort?  Partially... they do sound very good, even though the volume was reduced a bit, which was expected due to higher impedence.  Base is clean and tight... highs are very crisp and clean.  Volume can get loud without distortion.  But, I could not recommend them to anyone for installing in a Sequoia... I wouldn't do it again... too much work.  But, if these are purchased to be installed in a different vehicle where they installed easily, I can recommend them for their audio sound quality.  If your current speakers don't have a tweeter, the BA tweeters with cross-over will definitely extend the high frequency response...",3,1

"I bought this to use on my ihome dock with the otterbox defender case. While this fulfills the basic need of connecting the phone in the case to the dock, it sticks up very high and needs substantial back support to stay up. Furthermore, it acts as if it had a short pr something, if you don't hold it at the exact angle it doesn't charge. It was also very cheap. I only used it for a few days and it was starting to come apart. I returned it and bought the SendStation Dock Extender for iPod. It works with the phone and the support is great.<br /><br />Edit: I later bought a lifeproof case and at the time this was the only adapter that their website said would fit. I tried some cheap ones to no avail and ended up ordering another one of these. It was a different kind of plastic and much sturdier than the first. It ended up cracking the case though so I don't recommend it for the lifeproof. Otherwise it's fine.",3,2
"I received my armband and used it for the first time today. It looks well-made. There was an extender, which I didn't need, but it's nice that it was included. The armband fit my DROID RAZR MAXX HD, even with a (thin) case on. I felt like my phone was secure.<br />However, the phone just slips into the pocket, and there is no flap cover, so if it were raining, I probably wouldn't use this case. Also, the seam is right over the screen lock and volume buttons, making it very hard to press them while the phone is in the armband. I was able, after much frustration, to press the screen lock button, but I could not adjust the volume during my run, which made me a little irritated.<br />I will continue to use this case until I find one that suits my needs better.",3,2

The actual cover is pretty good. I can use my phone without much difficulty, and it feels decently protected.

"Hello,<br />I received the product and installed today for my IX-35. The product seems OK and a proffessional car audio installer did the connections and everything fine but not the steeling wheel control and I feel really frustrated because I want to use it. Connections are right but when I´m trying to configure the funtions on software and do what user manual says and move controls on my steeling wheel it doesn´t work. What should I do?... it is really urgent to me to fix this..",3,2
"I have very mixed feelings about these Dakota Alert transmitters.  Note that this review only covers the transmitter, not the receiver/base station.  Here are my experiences:  The Good:  When they are in operating condition, the transmitters work well for our situation.  If something crosses the path of the beam, it sends a signal to the base station which chimes.  That is all well and good.  I also have to give credit where credit is due - a few years ago, our chime went off at about 3 AM.  It turns out a burglar was on our property.  Thanks to the \\""early warning\\"" of the Dakota Alert system, we were able to summon the Police who arrested the man.  Without the chime, we would never have known the burglar was prowling until it was too late.  The Bad:  We have two of these transmitters set up on our property.  In the past 4 years, I have had to replace them both about 3 times due to various electronic failures.  That gets EXPENSIVE very quickly.  While I LOVE the \\""early warning\\"" provided by this Dakota Alert transmitter, the fact that they are seemingly so cheaply made and NOT very weather resistant is getting really old really fast!  One tip - If your transmitter will be located where it will be exposed to the full weather elements (rain, etc.), run a piece of thick, heavy duty tape around the seal where the door seals together.  This greatly extended the life of the last transmitter we had outdoors.  Unfortunately, the squirrels decided to chew it to pieces.  So, once again, I must decide if ANOTHER expenditure is worth it.  I would summarize by saying that the Dakota Alert transmitters do their job.  However, they seem to be short-lived devices, especially if used in unprotected outdoor locations.  You will be replacing them every so often, but when they work, you just might be thankful you have one; maybe consider it part of your \\""insurance\\"" premiums!  Good Luck!",3,1

"Pro:  This a nice product to protect your Ipod from accidents or abuse.     Cons:  I think however that the I pod should be put in upside down, because the earphone jack is in the bottom on the I pod, making it on top and easier to plug and unplug the headphones.   Also the cutout in the leather, where you plugin your charger and accessories should be just a bit larger. Some of the accessories are being ejected because they are up against the leather instead of being firmly seated in the slot, so the leather is pushing the acc. back out making it, the acc., useless. You can use an \\""exacto knife\\"" to correct this problem but it should have been thought of before hand and made the hole or slot large enough in the first place.",3,1
"Nook cover encroaches slightly on the screen, however after awhile you get used to it. Chargers are a great feature for the price and make it so you can charge your Nook almost any where you are. The light was nice but it quit the second day.<br /><br />For the price it is a great value.",3,1
"GPS works fine, however the URL for updating the maps does not seem to work.  Backup camera works, but there are no instructions to set it up, have to google search to find UTube demos for set up.

Whatever language it is in cannot be changed to English with \\""Regional Settings\\"" as most can, so the included Windows apps such as Word cannot be used.<br />Overall... you get what you pay for... A decent GPS and backup camera for a low price.",3,2
It's just kinda normal. I started picking at it and it came of at the corners and wouldn't stick back on. If you take it off it Probly won't work if you try to put it back on. I don't know a anybody who's recognized the domo yet except my cousin everyone else just says I like your monster iPod does it come in any other colors? So the reason for that might be where I live or it could be the product isn't the right color of brown.,3,2
This body glove comes one useful advantage and that is the 360 degree back rest. This back rest or (stand) allows the Iphone to sit in an angled position so the user can view the Iphone in a fixed handsfree position.  However the material is too thin for and stretches within a few weeks after normal use as it did with my body glove. After a few weeks of use the Iphone will begin to show some signs of looseness in the body glove from my experience with this product.  The solution would be to either mold this product thicker and or with a different material.,3,1

"The Anti-glare sheet was easy enough to put on and I do think it will protect the screen quite well, but it does make the screen look a bit grainy. Not sure how distracting that is going to be over time, thus the three star rating.",3,1
"This is a very sleek design, with just the right length for going between my iphone and portable amplifier. The problem is that this cable reliably goes out about 2 weeks after the Amazon return policy ends. I've gone through 2 of these in about 3 months.<br />It seems some of the wires inside the cable get worn out, because sound goes out in my left earphone. This is pretty disappointing, even for something I paid $4 for (and now the price has doubled. Time to find a new brand).",3,2

In my opinion, few of the narrators on this Library of Classics are excellent, some are good, most are only fair at best.  I had expected excellent narration and would not have purchased this had I known.  I just finished 'Tale of Two Cities' and counted at least 5 or 6 different narrators, some male, some female.  I wonder if this was recorded by a variety of volunteer literature or speech classes with students taking turns!  At least I won't take professional narrators for granted henceforth.",3,1
"The price was impressive, and the product works once you have it in hand.  But be aware: The little plastic adapters don't seem to fit properly.  I bought two of these (one for my iPod Nano and one for my iPod mini, for two separate computers).    The cradles work great for syncing, and look fairly good. None of the plastic adapter fittings (from either of the two sets of them I ordered and received) would fit on the base unit with either of my iPods connected.  It seems like they designed the product/cast the plastic just a little bit off center.  (If somebody got this wrong and then spent money to manufacture thousands of these I feel kinda bad for them)    So I just ignored all of the adapters and plug the iPods directly into the base unit.  It's not as pretty, but it works.  And it's a fair trade-off for a product that is so affordable.",3,1

"I use it with the Fiio E12 Mont Blanc portable headphone amp and an Ipod Touch. Solid connections and good sound. Works great. However, one big minus and hence only 3 stars. The 3.5 connector cable that goes into the amp wraps around the volume knob on the amp and makes it very difficult to adjust the volume. Too bad they don't make one with the cable coming out the left side and short enough to just plug in straight.",3,1
"Don't get me wrong the design's great... a little bit less bright then what I expected, but overall pretty decent. Now let's talk about protection...

Weeeellll if you're just getting this case for the looks then go right ahead click that add to cart button.

"This product just did not do it for me - it is ok at best for a waterproof mp3 player though in the ergonomics department it is great.  The sad thing is you cannot set it on shuffle, it is a pain to flip past a track, and if you want to clear your goggles well you better buy the extended headphones because there is little slack to work with.  Also the ear plugs do not fit well in my ears nor is the audio quality very good (I have had three previous waterproof mp3 players and the freestyle in the end wins).  It has a great design but really needs a software upgrade to allow playlists etc. instead of arduous file listings while connected via USB to the device.  Also might I add that NUI Digital (the vendor NOT the manufacturer) sent me one that was defective and never refunded me the shipping cost; called and harassed me at home, and in the end shipped me a second one that was also defective.    I had to call the Netherlands as this Item is not distrubuted in the US by the manufacturer to get the instruction manual (NUI Digital which is an apartment in Hawaii did not include this PDF/Document).  And finally determined with the help of their sales manager that the second one was also defective......I am not sure what to believe but NUI digital is a company I will never ever deal with again and I would like to thank Amazon for making this one right by me.",3,1
I just tried it on my iphone 4s with Lifeproof case and it interferes with case charging port access cover.

"I had bought these earphones in the hopes that they would be just as good as the previous non-mini model. I loved this brand of earphones and they were my go to for a waterproof pair. The previous model was an excellent model that lasted me a year without a hitch. Unfortunately it is discontinued, so I tried this pair.<br /><br />In comparison to the previous pair the sound quality and fit are the same. They are very tiny though compared to the previous model, but that isn't anything unexpected. What was was how cheaply they are made.<br /><br />The headphones lasted a month before the sealing film keeping the right bud together fell off slowly and eventually opened the bud exposing the inner wires. Needless to say, they are no longer water proof and I am going to briefly try to repair them.<br /><br />In there period of use they were definitely waterproof and not so durable. Use them for water only if you want them to last. But if you want an all day use model, pay the money for the upgraded pairs. They will likely last longer.",3,2
I got two of these for my daughter and nephew at Christmas to go on their Ipod's that they were going to get as gifts.

"I have tried screen protectors from nearly every company out there over the years. XO Skins is hands down, no questions the best quality screen protector I have used. Very easy to install (easier than most others), crystal clear, no \\""orange peel effect\\"", no haziness, no bubbles, no streaking, perfectly smooth (no rubbery feel like many others). It is hard to tell there is even a screen protector on my phone.<br /><br />The only issue I am having is a fairly big one. The screen protector has peeled above the earpiece (the thin strip of screen protector between the earpiece and the top of the phone), causing it to get snagged on almost everything and peel more. I have had it installed for just under 5 months. I'm not sure if it is peeling because of the case I use, the [[ASIN:B00634HDXE Incipio SA-204 Samsung Galaxy Nexus SILICRYLIC Hard Shell Case with Silicone Core - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black/Black]]. The case presses against the screen protector where it began to peel. I purchased the Case Fit screen protector because, well, I keep a case on my phone. I will be ordering the non-Case Fit, I think that will make a big difference. I'm not sure if other people have had the same problem with the Case Fit protector while using a case, but it seems like the regular protector would work out a lot better.",3,1

The earpiece microphone button crapped out on both units after three uses.  The company sent me one replacement, and the same thing happened.  The earpiece speaker still receives, but the transmit button totally failed.  That's three in a row.  The new ones I bought from another seller seem to working for now.<br />2.  Both antennas had an issue with the housing staying screwed into the connection to the radio.  This is a flimsy design.

95 Integra with stock wheels and hubcaps. These valve caps look nice except that the set screws stick out from the caps a lot when they are screwed in tight.  but..... It's not a very well thought out design when it comes to the set screws. The hubcaps on my car go on before lug nuts so I can't remove them to put these valve caps on without taking off the lugs. Not practical to just air up tires. The hex wrench barley fits between the valve cap and the hubcap making it very hard to turn the set screw. Especially when the set screw ends up on the back side when the cap is tight.,3,1

Although I haven't personally seen or used this item, I was told that the only issue with it was that once it was on the Nano, it was very difficult to remove.  Apparently it needed to come off in order for the Nano to fit onto the docking station.  It unsnaps but not easily.  The item is inexpensive enough that when ordering, one should get 2 or 3 in case it breaks.   The shipping for a single one is more than the cost of the case.",3,2

"I really wanted a transmitter that could let me play music from my ipod touch on my car's speakers and allow me to use BT for phone calls as well. At first I had to really fumble around. Just setting up the hardware posed a challenge. The instructions are so tiny that the included setup pictures were only slightly useful. If they were much larger I think I could have attached the strap on to the steering wheel much faster. And yes, it's a strap. For some reason I was under the impression that it would somehow snap onto the wheel (don't know where I got that idea). The strap is not secured like a buckle, so in fact, it can come loose and undone. I had planned to tape down one end to continue using it. The only thing is, it says the device is thin, but it's a bit bulky on the steering wheel. I'm a little weary because it seems like it might hinder driving.     Unfortunately several things prevented me from loving it. The device makes a REALLY annoying sound before it's connected to anything. It may just be mine but there was this terrible screeching, like the sound when trying to use dial up internet but continuous- which completely freaked me out. When I finally got one device paired, I had to fumble around and try and pair the other, which consisted of me turning off and on the transmitter again. After about 15 min when I finally got everything set up, I turned everything off, and back on and it automatically connected to the two devices (took me 15 min to figure out how to make it work).    Then I tested it, sound came out from car speakers wonderfully, and decently through built in speakers. I called someone and they didn't complain about voice quality, but they couldn't hear me as well unless I raised my voice. Also, they complained of a beeping. I thought it was my phone out of batteries but when I looked after hanging up I still had some power left.     I also think it screwed up the lcd where it says what channel I was on. Black ink? spread across, starting tocover the numbers up. Well, I should say I didn't watch it spread, but it wasn't like that when I was adjusting the frequency to couple the device with my car ('94 camry), and suddenly it was like that.    The music does indeed stop automatically when calling and resume when the call ends. It will read out the phone number calling you- i guess it might say the name if it is programmed to do so, but not sure. The play/ pause button resulted in major screwing up and the device went back to screeching in an unbearable way. The fast forward button allows change to a different song in your mp3 player's playlist.    The material itself is a hard plastic.    All in all, it doesn't seem too bad (At first sweep) but I really can't stand the screeching (maybe I'm doing something wrong or it's not compatible with my car?). I think I'll return and try Satechi's Soundfly BT instead.      ***Update***    Contacted customer service and they noted that it might just be my unit's issue for the screeching. Anyhow, I returned it for Satechi's Soundfly BT. SO MUCH BETTER. No more screeching. The speaker sound quality from the car is not as good as this product's, but overall I prefer it more to this. It plugs into the cigarette lighter but it's easily adjustable to be out of the way. And I'm pretty sure it's smaller than this product. I haven't worked out all the functions yet so no review yet.",3,2
I bought this for my Zune but it was way too large. I use it to hold my Garmin GPS. It gives good protection to my GPS and it fits well. A good deal for a GPS case - but doesn't really fit a Zune all that well.,3,1

While it does offer some protection, it is no subnstitute for a well padded case.  We're glad to have it, but will buy a slightly larger and better padded case next time.  It's well worth it for the price and, as long as it's not used heavily for travel, it's a good case.",3,1

"The video quality is truly amazing on this device.  I cannot give it full marks as I have been unable to get the software for the PC to function as advertised and the device is rather bulky on the windshield.  I have been unable to contact the support people for this product as yet.  Remember to purchase a class 6 or greater micro chip as it does not come with any memory.  It would also be a good idea to purchase a spare power cord AC for setting it up using a TV or other video screen.  The only other option is using the USB cable for power or discombobulating your car wire set up every time you want to play with the settings.  (things they don't tell you in the sales material).  Its also like having a cop riding along with you when you are consious of it running.  Rolling through stop signs, speeding and running amber lights just ups the guilt level with big brother in the car. It has a quality feel to it and does not miss a thing including your comments of other drivers (it also catches all your wifes backseat driving comments :-)).  It is also hard to believe all the technology that can be built into such a small device.  USB, HDMI, GPS, high res camera, laser pointer, mute switch, remote control sensor, DC input, etc.  And it all works every time!  Would I recommend it? - absolutly!",3,1

"Hefty little thing.  The sound quality ranges from darn new inaudible (holding it in my hand) to fairly decent.  The surface has to be thin enough to resonate but not so thin as to buzz. The best surfaces I found was my huge bathroom mirror. The vibrating transducer end is covered by a 1mm thick resilient cushion that reminds me of vinyl friction pads made to hold cell phone on your car's dashboard.<br />The weighty BT5 is too heavy to mount to a vertical surface without help.  I used a small box to support the weight of the BT5 as the resilient cushy business end lightly adhered to the mirror.  The sound was better than any surfaces I had around the apartment so far.  What I would like is a big glass table supported at the corners or edges to place this on.<br />So far, to me, this little device is a nice novelty but certainly not a replacement for a conventional speaker, that is until I find the right resonating surface.

It's comfortable but it's big for my arm :( I have to add more velcro to make it tight enough so it won't slide off. Other htan that it's true color and doesn't interfer with my iphone's touch screen.,3,1
"I purchased the Sony CDX-M60UI after reading lots of reviews and thought it was the best choice for the money. I needed a marine grade stereo to install in my Harley-Davidson touring bike. I also changed out the stock speakers for Bazooka speakers. I wasn't impressed with the stereo as far as the bass it puts out without and amp and subwoofer. There is no bass boost or loud option to give you that extra bass so I have the bass adjusted all the way up and the mids and highs in the minus. Additionally I wanted it for my ipod and when I hit a hard bump with the bike the sound goes off and it reads no devise detected for a second or two then comes back on. I also do not like the volume control knob instead of a push button up/down for the volume. It's hard to turn while riding and if you bump it slightly it switches to mode from volume. I know from being a boat owner, the same will happen in rough water trying to hold your hand perfectly still to adjust volume.",3,1
"It was a gift for my woman, since she has an iPhone.  Good thing is it works. Bad thing is the case charger will not fit any other cases for protection and she already broke the side of the charger case ob the 2 nd day.  Update**  The case broke after two weeks of use due to fall, and the screen cacked.",3,2
got it for my son and he likes it and so all is good,3,1
This is my second BlueAnt and it's good bluetooth for my vehicle.. The downs side is the lenght of the re charging cord and on this model the on-off switch doesn't &#34;turn-on &#34; well. Bought it for ruffly $50 bucks which beats the retail price Of $100 at some outlets.,3,1
"Very nice speakers, got em underpowered on a 720 watt kenwood amp. (which is also powering a pair if alpine type r's in the front) Had these custom mounted in the rear deck of my toyota avalon. Would sound thousands of times better at low volumes if they were in an enclosure.",3,1
"Leather case is fine, however there is a leather case that comes with the iPAQ so found this one is not necessary.",3,1
"There is nothing wrong with the design, fit, as well as the rubber quality. However, the actual color is looked much cheaper than the pic on Amazon. Keep in my when you want to order the choco color case. It is looked like grape color more than chocolate.",3,1
"This unit served me well for a few years, but then the touch screen started to get majorly calibrated. As another reviewer said, you would have to touch a bit to the left or right of a button to get it to go. Eventually it got so bad it was virtually useless. I took it apart and tried to fix it- now it doesn't work at all. I'm tired of putting up with Pioneer: exorbitant service fees, poor user interfaces, and screens that go bad.",3,2
"Material and price are OK; however, the Kobo Touch doesn't fit properly because left side is a bit wider than right side.<br /><br />Design is not very ergonomic; next time, I would buy a flip case.",3,2
not accurate at all i used my voltage tester to check these out and there way off BUT if you know how far off they are (1.5 volts for mine) then they work great i know when this tester says 13.5 its really 14.5+,3,1

"The MOTOACTV Sports Wrist Strap is the most practical accessory for using the [[ASIN:B005Q3144W MOTOACTV GPS Fitness Tracker and Music Player]] (review forthcoming) for heart rate based training.  I have also used the [[ASIN:B005Q314FG MOTOACTV Sports ArmBand]] (see my review), but I found this made the unit less accessible.  Using the Sports Wrist Strap makes the MOTOACTV much like using my [[ASIN:B000CSWCQA Garmin Forerunner 305]] (see my review).<br /><br />Even though it is the most practical option, it is not without issues.  It lacks somewhat in comfort, but it is about on par with the Forerunner.  I find it manageable, but others may find the lack of comfort a deal breaker.  Another thing that is less than optimal is using the unit with headphones such as the [[ASIN:B005PVXIVM Motorola SF200 Sports Headphones]] (see my review).  While running on the treadmill I would occasionally catch the cord with my hand during my arm swing.  I wound up loosely gripping the cord on the headphones to keep this from being an issue.  I would actually recommend using a Bluetooth stereo headset if you already have one.  Finally there is the fastener on the wrist strap itself.  I would have preferred a simple strap like you would find on the Forerunner or almost any Polar unit.  While it works, the metal push-in knobs give me durability concerns with repeated use.<br /><br />All things considered; however, it is still the best option for using the MOTOACTV for heart rate based training.  Both the Clip and the Arm Band for the MOTOACTV make the unit less accessible for using the heart rate monitor function.  If you have questions that I have not addressed, please feel free to ask below in the comment section.",3,1

"I find it cool it's a great mirror the only thing is I fight with it when I go outside as soon as your near sun you can't see anything lol , and it gets dirty easy but it sticks great I still love it and won't take it off",3,1
"I use a Speck case and it won't fit unless you take the case off all together. Such a pain! Also the red light on it that indicates it is plugged in is extremely too bright and very distracting at night while driving.  The charger itself works though, so if you don't use a case or have a case with an open bottom, then this should work great for you.",3,2
"I got this one week ago with some suspicion about this product.  Usually, FM transmitter with charger cost a lot more than this.    i was really worried bcuz it is cheap and no review, but its only 24 bucks so worth to try.    And it is working.   It does what it says.    Charges my iphone 3Gs, and i can play music in my car.  However, the connector seems little loose.  (Case can make it loose)    And sound quality, i think you should not expect amazing quality from 24 bucks.   Its ok quality, however it tends to get wierd noises sometimes.    Well, if you dont wanna spend a lot for FM transmitter, get this.  You can still listen to music with ur iphone or ipod.",3,1
"I'm happy with the price and easy function of this speaker.  I use it to replace my laptop and tablet speakers to enjoy my music and Netflix movies. I agree it could use more bass for my genre of music but for the price, I'm good.",3,1
"These are pretty neat little screens. They look good and are easy to put on. However, they do reduce the screens sensitivity sometimes.",3,1
"Something big and a little flimsy headset side handles, but they have good sound and clear, are cheap and I give it only 3 stars",3,1
It is a fun gauge to have.  Love the atomic clock and the phases of the moon.  It has everything you could want in a weather unit.  Tells the pressure and the weather outside.  Accurate indoor readings.  When it is working outside it is very accurate.  Have found however if it gets too cold outside the temperature will fail to read.  Fortunately I live in the south and that has not been much of a problem.  I think it has to do with the battery yet everything we tried just did not work.  If I hear from Meade and can get a fix on that I would say this unit is just about perfect.,3,1
"Camera worked fine for about 5 months. Then random reboots. Used different cables, different chargers, etc. Still, after 10 minutes of recording, same thing. Tried to contact seller, no avail.

"Ok you get what you pay for. The radio speaks to you in Chinese.....only. You can turn the voice off, but its Chinese or nothing.  The instruction booklet is relevant but not for this actual radio. So it almost works sometimes.  If you enjoy fiddling around with radio's you'll enjoy it.  I program mine to work with the bubble pack frs/gmrs radios.  Now with this option it is the best radio i have used to communicate with other bubble pack radios. Way way outperforms the best on the market. So to sum it up, its a little wonky but the radio is ok, and i ordered another for hiking and commuting and so on. You can't easily switch between uhf and vhf though.",3,1

"First a correction to the spec.  This Stereo has 4 50W outputs.  The pinout label has the Left Front and Left Rear outputs swapped.<br />The USB port can not be used for charging an iPod Touch.  The AUX input works well.  The SD card reader works good, only issue is getting files loaded in the correct order on the SD card.  Recommend that if the order is important that you reformat the SD card before writing any files to it.  Have not used the USB port for any audio so will not judge it.<br />Had to use the remote to set the clock to the correct time.  The instructions that came with it are for a different model.<br />Overall it works well and at $19.99 I would call it a good value.<br /><br />Added comments: I've had a chance to use it for a couple of weeks.  The display does not dim, but it is not overly bright to present a problem driving at night around the city, may be an issue if driving on dark county roads.  The clock only displays when you turn off the unit, and the clock shows time in the 24 hour format.",3,1
"It's nice & seems to fit nicely on my IPod touch, however I was never sent the 2 tone color I ordered. Instead I received 2 of the same color: all black. Also the strap is useless; nowhere to put it.",3,2
"Product was good, but for $25 shipping, I would expect more than a squashed, banged up box that was too big for the item and didn't contain any extra packing material.",3,1
"It's a nice screen, smooth to touch and the finger print and oil wipe off real easy. But the screen was too reflective. I know it's not anti reflective but it seems to make the phone more reflective than without the screen. I'm waiting for PowerSupportUSA's screen.",3,2
"This device works, however I don't think it has the best clarity. It reminds me of an old transistor radio that you had to move around to get static-less reception. It doesn't work well on bridges or in tunnels. The price is right though and much cheaper than  buying a new car stereo.",3,1
"It culd be better, but it is seems to be not well finished",3,1
"The power charger works fine by itself, but it doesn't work with the vent mount.  When you attached the mount to the Mio GPS the plastic casing prevents the power charger from an appropriate connection. I just threw that part out!",3,2
Purchased 3 but 1 was defective. Overall price per piece was still a huge savings compared with other retail versions.,3,1
Doesn't hold a charge very long - about 2.5 hours for video.  Screen definition isn't too great - you have to look at it straight on or focus is lost. It DOES have several functions like voice record.,3,1
"Mine worked well enough for me, but it's just not that much better than the little transmitters that come with RTF models such as the \\""Champ\\"".  My advice is to save your money, buy a little RTF trainer with a short range transmitter, then get the DX6i later.  The 6 is a much better radio, with memorized trim and travel settings for 10 models.",3,1
"this is a solution for third party cables that are too big, thats it. apples stupid bumper and many other cases are completely unforgiving for larger cables. this is the solution and it works. downside? this thing is way too expensive ($19?) it costs .25c in china to make i guarantee you, unfortunately i could not find a knock off, kind of surprising given how many apple bumper clones there are.",3,1
"The product itself works fine in terms of basic playback, but there is no way to use it without headphones, and it does not work with the DC adapter in the car.  Its instruction booklet says nothing about its power sources, and the customer service is not responding to either e-mail or voice messages.  So if you have any problem, you are on your own.",3,2
My wife saw this in a boutique and wanted it but she already had a case.  I returned her case and found this online.  It was the same price as the retailers.  Somehow I get to thinking Amazon items will be better priced.,3,1
"It was a Christmas gift for the guy who is hard to shop for.  However, I haven't sent it off yet, since I ordered too late for it to come before Christmas and I better do it soon or I'm going to be trying it out myself!",3,1
"I purchased this to use primarily with my mp3 player although the other features looked attractive also.  I read all the other reviews & understood that reception might be a problem as i live in a somewhat large metro area..Memphis, TN, but decided to make the purchase just to test out the product.  The GSI transmitter was put together well & all the controls & features were easy to figure out.  It's not a bad product, but I could not find a station that offered static free reception.  If parked in one spot it worked fine, but while driving it didn't take long to get static & have to find another station, also the volumn controls had to be turned up substantially.  It may work for you, but I've resorted back to ear buds.",3,1
"I gave it three stars because it works well. When it arrived, however, the package/ box it was in seemed like it had been used/open. But it worked just fine. I specifically purchased it for my iPod Touch/ iPhone but it does not charge them, it just says it's not compatible.<br />The flash light is great though.",3,1
Gets the job done.  Instructions were translated to English horribly.  Trial and error to figure it out.  I ordered the optional GPS but there's no indication I received it.  Not worth pursuing.  Overall worthwhile and I may buy another.  Consider hardwiring power cord to fuse box to free up your DC power port (cigarette lighter port).,3,1
"Was kinda disappointed with this. Like the size and shape and that you can use an SD card with it,but when played for long periods of time sound goes fuzzy",3,2
is not very steady.  I turn a corner and it slips causing static to come through instead of music.  I also cannot use if for hands free speaking through my radio.  I would not buy this product again.,3,2
"So far, my only gripe with this unit is the center post is not tall  enough to allow a lower angle for the screen to tilt down far enough to be easily visible from the high dashboard of my car.  My contact with the merchant was productive, in that they were totally understanding and are giving me the time needed to make sure I can \\""live with it.\\""  If not, they have been gracious regarding a return, so how can anyone go wrong with that kind of support?  You CAN'T!!  Otherwise, it definitely stays in place when cornering, is very well made, but the shipping cost was almost as much as the unit itself.  Bottom line...I think it would be wiser to make a visual purchase from a local merchant versus going on blind faith with an order house that charges high shipping fees to boot.",3,1
"Though this is an inexpensive unit that sounds \\""just OK\\"", it has no tone control and is boomy. The bass is too heavy and there is no way to increase the treble.",3,1
"The cam is fine. The mount was unusable, and had to be modified for use. There was no gel pen, no matter, decent delivery time.",3,2
"It held both our tablets, one of which has an Otter case on it.  BUT, whenever we would hit a bump on the road, it would slide down and make this terrible noise right behind the driver's head.",3,2
"The one thing not mentioned in the descriotion is that this radio does not support usb connection from a cell phone.  Since iphone5 cannot connect to top of the stereo it would be nice if USB would support it. The other option is using an audio line in for all phones that are not supported.<br /><br />The stereo is nice looking, compact and sounds fine for what it is otherwise.",3,2
Hard to use the tough screen  when in the case.. Have not had a chance to check the Waterproof yet.,3,1
well built radio but not as advertised for features,3,1
"Very light and low quality, which is expected at this price. Can be worth if it you have realistic expectations.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Cheap.<br />- It does what it says. Music playback is OK.<br />- Battery life seems good.<br />- Looks like an old gen iPod, if you care about this.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The buttons are VERY loud.<br />- The menu navigation is really confusing, especially if you're used to other devices. Example: &#34;Menu&#34; is the enter/select button, &#62;&#62; is down, &#60;&#60; is up, and the only use for the middle button is volume control when in playback mode. I also cannot find a way to move back through the menus - I have to hold down the &#34;Menu&#34; button to be taken back to the main menu and start again. Selecting an album is really annoying (you have to navigate through a multi-level directory using the Menu and arrow buttons).<br />- There are occasional garbled blips during music playback.",3,1
ive seen other ipod touch covers of this bunny but how come yours doesnt have a puff ball at the end of it . Also since theres no puff ball why is there a random circle at the back of the case?,3,2
"I've JUST installed this speaker into a custom fiberglass ported box in my trunk.  The speaker sounds FANTASTIC, HOWEVER; I specifically ordered the lower power; older model because that's what best fit my system requirements.  While this delivers superb sound quality, it doesn't match up to my system - it's literally 100w too powerful in its handling and my amp can't push it appropriately.  FYI for all those looking at this model, you may receive the 600w Max rather than the 500w Max.  Call me a fool for complaining about the better model, but I am slightly disappointed that I didn't receive precisely what I ordered. I give minus 2 stars for lack of quality control on the distributor's behalf.  The speaker is, again, top notch!",3,1
"The charger has somehwat of a shortage..it works sometimes, but sometimes I have to unplug it before it gives a charge.",3,1
"The cover is pretty but the bow fell out almost immediately after putting on the iPod, cover was for my daughter so she keeps reattaching with glue gun",3,2
"Was nice while it lasted - the zipper broke!  It fits the Nook well, and there are many colors from which to choose.  Just be EXTREMELY careful with the zipper!",3,2
"Purchased because it was described as easy to install. It was easier than those screen protectors that require deionized water and care when applying, but it is thick and when using the stylus there is a slight noise created when moving across the screen.",3,1
"while the concept is good, I think it would work better if it were made from a more dense rubber.  It is not as stable as I would like it.",3,2
"I am fairly happy with this keyboard.  It has a couple of issues.  First, the portal to connect the charger doesn't seem to be exactly right, I have to wiggle the charger in order to get it to connect.  Second, it did not want to link to my Nook.  I had to keep rebooting my Nook, and then going through the sync process for almost 40 minutes before it worked.  Now that it is set up, it works great.  I just have to be mindful when I go to charge it, otherwise the cord falls out and it doesn't charge.",3,1
its not bad but if i would have think about it a little longer i wouldnt have bought it.. it has to many things your not really going to use ever..and the quality looks like something you can get at the dollar house...all i used from this was the chargers and the car one makes me scare because it look like a toy...but if you dont care about quality i thing this would be okay and the price is not that bad...,3,2
"Item arrived in good condition but not really the device described.  Its not blue its black and although the remote shows it has the folder view, the device cannot or does not read folders so all your songs have to be on the root, making it a simple fm tuner that has little or no shuffle or organized list (other than the order the files are on the drive).  despite that the device does operate as described, it does recognize if you have a USB or flash or headphone wire plugged in (use the one that came with the device by the way, its differently sized at the plug in on the device).<br />setting the frequency and getting it to play on my car stereo was seamless, I just wish it had a shuffle or the remote worked a little better to be able to skip around songs.  Overall it does what you expect it to do, just not all of what is described.",3,1
"This item is very cute and trendy, but it does not protect your ipod. It is not worth six dollars.",3,2
Super well made product but did not work for my application hence the 3 star rating.,3,2
"The connectors/terminals are crap. The insulation is thick and I am not thinking the wire itself is 4 ga, more like 6. It did do what I needed though. For the low end cost it is alright.",3,1
"I just started using this unit 2 days ago. Though the plastic housing is a little cheap I like the overall design. The remote is a big plus! This is my first FM transmitter, so I'm not sure how it compares with other products. But to claim this product will produce CD quality sound is a stretch. It doesn't even come close. FM quality sound is the best you're going to get. I live in large metropolitan area so there is only one unused station, and there is still some static on that station. I spent the first day trying to tone down the treble and reduce the static. The single most beneficial thing I did was to turn off my iPod's equalizer. I tried all the different music settings first then finally just turned it off and that did the trick. I still get static but not nearly as much. If you like your music to have the best sound possible this is not the way to go. Get a stereo that has an auxiliary plug so you don't have to transmit through the radio.",3,2
"Having trouble with them cutting out on the motorcycle, will try again. In the truck they work well and walking. They do not sync with HTC One phone but do sync with iPad and iTouch, and my husbands non-smartphone. Overall good but wouldn't have bought them if I knew they wouldn't sync with my phone.",3,1
"This case doesn't cover most of the ipod, just the back and two sides so I would suggest also getting a screen protector with the case. This case also prevent the use of an itrip without taking the case off completely. This case lasted about 3 months before it started falling apart and the sparkles were coming off from the first day. The only appeal is the sparkles and since the main purpose of a case is to protect the device, I would suggest going with a sturdier option.",3,2
"The ear pads work great with my Shure earphone set, but I was hoping the case would be big enough to hold the set too.  It's not, so I'm using it for holding some other small items.",3,2

This product was difficult for my daughter to use with her ipod.,3,2
"The sound is really good for the price. Don't expect Bose quality. I have had problems when it is in Bluetooth mode because it seems to just stop playing even though it is fully charged. When plugged in with a cable to a device, it works well. The other thing that is really funny is the voice. It has a strong Asian accent and second language issues when it talks. &#34;Bluetooths model is open.&#34;  &#34;Now is oxymodo.&#34; I use this in a classroom so it has become a running joke with my class. How hard is it to find one native English speaker to record the voice? For $40, what do you expect. That's the only reason it gets an OKAY from me.",3,1
"Mine is an '03 MINI and the plastic cover of the unlock button (shaped like the wings) broke.  I saw this and jumped on it as it was bargain priced as compared with a dealer provided unit.<br /><br />Upon rcpt, I discovered the &#34;wings&#34; button is not a button at all. It is a non-functional emblem.  The other button does work, however.  So I can lock remotely but cannot unlock.<br /><br />I still consider it a win...as I have made this my spare key and am using the other OEM key as my everyday key.

Kinda figured that going in, but expected to get what was ordered. They likely have a parts-picking problem, because what I got was nowhere near what was ordered. (A bit comical in fact.)    In the end wasn't really worth the hassle, so went another Amazon route and got what I wanted.",3,2

"First of all, let me state that I purchased this item as an interim solution, since there are not a lot of high quality iPad skins actually shipping (yet).    Pros:  inexpensive, available now, holes line up correctly with the various ports    Cons: a bit thin, fit could be better (the case I received wraps around to cover the \\""frame\\"" of the front glass, and the rubber doesn't sit flush on the glass in some places -it is not exactly like the picture).    Because the material is a bit thin, I would not trust this case to protect the iPad against a drop onto a hard surface. For protection against scratches and minor bumps, it should be fine.",3,1
Great little cover for the price.  Just a warning it you have to take the cover off in order to charge/plug in your ipod.  Other than that is does what it needs to do.,3,1

"Not exactly stylish; stands out like a sore thumb on my shoe, but it does what I wanted it to.",3,1
Online this product looked great. To be honest this is exactly what they avertised. However what I did not like is that I was not able to use this like I had anticipated. I was making my way up the east coast in a 2006 impala and was trying to use the gps on my ipone. When I plugged it in I guess where the outlets are they are too low or the neck of this is too short. Either way where it would sit I could not get a suffecient signal to use the GPS and have it sit in this. Also it was not strong enough to hold the weight of the phone (IPONE 3GS) which it clearly stated it could. Over all I was not satisfied with the product.,3,2
Car charger worked in one car but not the other.<br />I never used the armband.<br />The case was just okay.,3,2
I only needed one but four were better than the 10 in the other package.  I wish they were a little thinner.,3,1
Soft feel and good fit and functionality. My only complaint is the product looks different in person- it is more pink than purple.,3,1
"Got mine from SpyTech.<br /><br />It arrived quickly enough and I found SpyTech to be accessible to the user.<br /><br />I give SpyTech itself five stars: you call the number, get a mercifully-short<br />voice menu, hit \\""2\\"" for tech support, and you're talking to a real, live human being.<br /><br />I give the product 3 stars because:<br /><br />- The manual is pitiful - like somebody's brother-in-law-who-had-2-years-of-English<br />  attempted to translate it from the Korean.... and failed.<br />  Geeze guys, how much would it cost to hook up with some<br />  retired native-English-speaking techie and have him do it<br />  at least halfway right?<br /><br />- My particular instance of the product came in a box whose writing<br />  was all in Cryllic.

"So I tried this with a Samsung Galaxy S3 and an iPhone 4s. I had connectivity problems with the S3, but no issues with the 4s. However, when used with the 4S the volume was much too high to use at work, even on the lowest setting. So I had to buy something else.",3,2
The iPod fits firmly and looks cool. Good for sports or to use as a fashion watch. Cost more than the average offered in the internet but worth.<br /><br />UPDATE - After a month of use the case that holds the iPod broke. I was just using it for walk and not for X games activities! Better try the LunaTik model from the same company.,3,1
"This case is sort of a pain to use. Getting the ipod in takes a bit of a struggle, and it's difficult to get to the lock button and headphone jack. The price, however, makes it a worthwhile purchase for someone who just needs a basic case for working out.",3,2
"Bought to protect my daughters Ipod 4th generation. It doesn't feel as sturdy as I thought it would be, but for $5 what do I expect, but it feels ok enough to protect her device. So we will see",3,1
"I bought this cover for my mother who owns a 4th Generation iPod. Trust me, it's not the best cover around, but it does protect the Ipod tightly. The ipod doesn't slide off from the cover, an \\""L\\"" shaped headphone base can fit, & the screen is surely protected & gives off great clear color through it. However, don't bother installing the belt clip, just stick it in your pocket. Overall, it does a great job protecting the Ipod, that's for sure, but don't bother taking it out every once in a while, it's very difficult to carefully take out the cover. It won't fit in the dock, I don't mind that. Another good thing about it is when you charge it, it doesn't really overheat inside.     I'd recommend this if you just want your ipod protected from scratches. & don't bother putting the belt clip. I'd pretty much rate this a 3.5 stars.",3,1
"I like the retro design of the case being a cassette tape, but there is no place to put the charging cord. What's up with that?",3,2
"Not as good as I hoped, but it does what it's supposed to...most of the time.  I would not purchase again if I had to do over again.  Too many apps that do similar function for much cheaper in annual service.",3,1
"Seems to work in &#34;indoor&#34; tests, but not out in the car.  Haven't had time to really wring it out.  Solid, anyway.",3,2
I bought this for my iPod touch and it was good for the first few weeks but the thin hard cover started to split within a month. It started to form cracks and one day just split in half! It wasn't very protective either. I guess you get what you paid for...,3,2
"I dont like it because,you have to pull of the case to get  the kickstand out. Also it falls (kickstand) very easily.",3,2
It only works now when standing beside the car.,3,1
This is not a case for an iPod Touch 5th Gen. The hole for the headphone jack is on the wrong side and it covers up 3/4 of the external speaker. Other then that it is well made.,3,2
I chose a 3 star because on the picture the the case looked a lighter blue than it actually is.Other than that inconvenience  the case was great,3,1
"It was okay..... I expected better but hey, you get what you pay for, its okay for the price, but if you want something top of the line spring for something more expensive.",3,1
cool but only three stars due to it not coming with an sd to save anything,3,1
I love the color. N love penguins. But it was flimsy. This case was not a hard cover protectant. And to be put in my pocket was impossible.,3,1
"This product is clearly made to be a generic fit for most phones. The EVO 3D slides right out of it when inverted, which isnt much of an issue running or weightlifting. The buttons on bottom and menu on top are also covered by the case, making it very difficult to use with out removing it. Thankfully it slides right out...",3,2
"I like the look and feel of the leather case. Its slim lines and ease of use are also appreciated. However, the magnets that hold the case closed do not keep it closed as tight as I would like. I have only used it for a few days, so I fear this problem will only get worse.",3,2
the case slides off a little if you put it in a tight fitting pocket. It aslo feels to be slightly loose. It also had some black marks on the back which were a nuisance to get out. best luck searching for a new case if you're considering this one,3,1
good but wish it came with chip,3,1
"I paired this with my Android smart phone and am happy with the sound quality. It is pretty easy to raise and lower the volume by twisting the cylinder. But because the play/pause button is on the bottom, it isn't very convenient and doesn't get used much.<br /><br />I also did try using the microphone, but the person on the other end said they couldn't hear me very well.<br /><br />I was hoping that it would be a little louder, but it was adequate for listening to an audiobook on a car trip.<br /><br />I haven't tested the extent of the battery life. So far it seems it can easily go for two hours between charges. I haven't had an opportunity to push it beyond that.",3,1
"The product does exactly what is says it is going to do. But, there is a cost and that is picture quality. If you only use this to read and play games or surf the web. You have the correct protector. The problem for me and other is that we won't trade picture quality on movies, video and pictures. BTW, the excuse that some are making is that you have to trade that quality for a screen protector are blowing smoke up you butt! I have a screen protector for my Samsung Galaxy SII and it is barely noticeable if at all when watching video content. Recap, you won't to watch video content don't buy this...otherwise, this is a great product for you.",3,1
"As much as I like these retractable cables, I think the regular pulling on them stresses them more than regular cables, as I've had others fail.  When the white insulation started cracking and exposing the wires at the connectors, I put a bunch of glue there, and this has kept it working.  For the money--it's still a good deal.",3,1
I chose this rating of 3 stars because I think it is an appropriate rating for this product and its quality.,3,1
The order arrived in 4 weeks. The price is too low. I was expecting a cheap product but it is not. The charger looks original but the cable supplied with it does not work.,3,2
This product worked wonderfully for a few months and then over the past two months we have noticed the battery dieing on the motorcyle. It appears that even though the radio was off the LCD screen was still draining the battery. We were nearly left stranded 2 states away from our home but fortunately we were traveling with someone with a car and jumper cables. We have been unable to use the product since this incident. Also the reception is nearly never clear. Antenna was moved around on the motorcyle with not much better results.,3,2
"I received the item as guaranteed. After a minor alteration, the item meet my needs. Overall I am satisfied with what I purchased.",3,1
It doesn't beep as loud if you are more then 15ft away.  I used a zing-sag tracing pattern the same hour I received it in the mail.  If sounder was just a higher beep it could earn 4 Stars.,3,1
Worked for a while but became damaged very easily. Screen protector was very nice though,3,1
So far the case protects the iPod very nicely... but with the case on it is hard to press buttons on edge of the screen because the case window is just a little too small.,3,1
"Bought this to watch TV via Bluetooth headset (LG HBS-700)<br />Depending on your TV configuration, audio output could be difficult to reach (our Sharp LCD was in the back and our TV is wall mounted). But this product is not at fault here. The major annoyance (and two stars taken off) is that RCA cable that is listed as included, was missing. And for some reason none of local stores carry it (best buy and frys), so we had to spend a lot of time to get male version of that cable and jack to jack connector (7.00 extra cost for that)<br /><br />Another minor annoyance is the bluetooth light blinking very bright, so for bedroom TV we have to turn it off at night.<br /><br />Other than that, works great. If you decide to buy, make sure you have that RCA cable",3,1
"I liked everything but the clamps.  Worked great for the itouch for about a month then the clamps that hold it in place were not holding it in place very much.  now when I hit a bump the ipod falls out.  The sound quality is good, I really love the little remote.  Overall its okay, the clamps were really disappointing.  I solved the problem by adding foam tape to the clamps and it hold much better now.",3,1
"For what this is; an inexpensive charger; it works just fine. For the price, you can't beat it.",3,1
"The good:<br />1. A Bluetooth cassette adapter eliminates cords and clutter.<br />2. No static whatsoever, which is more than I can say for ANY corded cassette adapter, regardless of price or quality.<br />3. Sound quality, although there is a slight loss of volume, which is a common issue in any Bluetooth paired device in a car (even when paired directly with a factory radio).<br />4. Relatively easy to pair for the first time.<br />5. The price.<br /><br />The bad:<br />1. The microphone cord is not an ideal setup for front loading tape decks. On some corded cassette adapters, the cord could be rerouted through different sides of the tape to compensate for different tape deck setups. Getting the tape in and out of my front loading tape deck was awkward and aggravating. Within 5 uses, the cord became stripped, so I just cut it.  Judging by some of the harsh criticism of the call quality, it sounds like I'm not missing much.<br />2. It doesn't automatically repair with my phone. I have to do this every time I get in and out of the car, which is annoying. What's worse is that lately when I've attempted to pair it again after the connection has been temporarily broken, I've had mixed success.  Sometimes when repairing it, the connection is so bad, I have to erase the device from my phone and start from square one, which is beyond frustrating.<br /><br />I cannot comment on battery life because I use this tape in my weekend car. It's supposed to last 6 hours on one charge, but the longest I've ever used it after being charged is about two hours. I did notice once that when I left my car without shutting it off, I *think* it powered itself off. If I'm right about that, then it's an excellent feature.<br /><br />Overall, for $40, it's pretty good for what it is.  I'll hang on to it until something better comes along.",3,1
"Nothing to dislike, it fits like its suppose to without any gaps. Got it for my 4-yr old son and he loves it.",3,1
"The accessory pack was complete as indicated in the sales literature. However, there were items and cables included with no explaination of what they were for or how to use them. Expirmentation helped put the belt holder together as an example. Documentation would have made this a much more acceptable purchase.",3,1
So far so good but not too sturdy. ..too soon to rate. .will rate again in couple months. .my xmas tapes are finally playing,3,1
"I BOUGHT THIS &#34;HARD CASE&#34; 4 MY TOM TOM 55 TM WITH OUTER ITEMS & THEY CAME ABOUT A WEEK BE4 & THE GPS UNIT WAS NOT TO MY LIKING , SENT IT BACK & THE NEXT DAY THE CASE CAME,,,,IT LOOKS NICE & SHOULD WORK BUT NO LONGER HAVE ANYTHING TO PUT IN IT!!! TURNS OUT IT COST MORE TO SHIP BACK THAN I PAID FOR IT !!!!SO I WILL FIND A USE FOR IT",3,2
Bought as a gift for a children's shelter as a holiday present. No idea on the outcome.,3,2
"It fix good but the only thing is the speaker is still cover. I didn't not get my screen protector. I only got the case and them minisuit key chain, i though there was i part it could attach the mini key chain thing too.",3,2
"Puchased as replacement for another failed CD player.  This is the 5th CD player i've owned (Denon x 2, HHB, CAL, now the Sony), and accept that CD players have inherent service life limitations.  A more expensive unit may be a waste of money given the future of CD media as known these last 25 or so years.  My expectations of the Sony are realistic,  At this price level inexpensive mostly plastic construct was expected.  It sounds fine to my ears though have yet to put it through critical listening tests. The single critique I have is that the start-pause-FF-RW emblems on the buttons are embossed and hard to read.",3,1
"Ordered this on a whim and for the sake of replacing a couple of my old iPod touch 5th gen covers. The material is excellent quality and the color is as pictured, but the edges of it push my screen-protector up around the edges and corners...",3,1
"I see some complaints about it being cheap and faulty and all but for 7.99 (against 25/30/50/60 dollar ones from local stores) what else can you expect. So far, mine has been pretty good and I don't have any major issues with it. It gets the job done like its supposed to. The only improvement they could make is to cut back on the static. Sometimes (depending on the area you're driving I guess) you can hear some static in the background of the music...its as if you changed the dial one stop too many but can still get the sound. Anyway like i said for 8 bucks its about as good as I would expect.",3,1
We have not used it yet. Will come in handy for training purposes it was a good price great packaging and comes with a microphone,3,1
I love this item very well .but and I don't say that Litely I like this item don't get me wrong .like I said there is a but it could last longer on a charge it lasts about 6 hours and that is all the developers should have produced a longer lasting battery .or a larger one . The device is very small it would have been very easy to use a larger power source but they did not ...so that is the reason I've given a 3 stars revue .......,3,1
"Unlike the other review, I find the sound quality pretty good. I've had it for about six years but I've had to send it back to the distributor for repairs to the CD player, once and now, within three years and with not very frequent use, the CD player is acting up again. The box is great, the components are cheap.",3,1
2012 Cadillac Cts sometimes it's off. I have to reset it and turn off car to start again  eh,3,1
"This product is pretty good, but it's very hard to install, it will ALWAYS cause some bubble. Overall, it is a pretty cheap and good product.",3,1
"This product looked exactly as shown, however I have replaced it with a rigid case as that one was always falling off!!!",3,1
"It's the weirdest thing; I can't figure it out. It's super cute, and APPEARS to be fairly well-made, but then when I pulled the belt clip away from the unit, the green tore, and it looks like it's just paper. Where it used to be green, now it's just white like paper. (UPDATE: Yes, it is just paper. Sort of a thin cardboard.)<br /><br />In addition, there is no ring on it anywhere for a lanyard, if that matters to you. It doesn't matter overly to me, but I would have preferred it. In any case, I'm just letting you know.<br /><br />Lastly, it is SKINtight. You cannot fit an iPod (3rd gen) in here if it has even those thin, hard protective snap-on cases on them. My old case that is very similar to this one fit my iPod with the snap on case perfectly. With this one, there is just no way. So it's an either/or thing.  Again, just letting you know.<br /><br />In any case, for the price I expected better. I expected it not to tear instantly, and I expected the fake leather to be made of something more substantial than paper. But it's very cute, and it fits my iPod, so it'll do for now. I guess.",3,1
Music sound great. I have iphone 6 and could not make it work to receive calls but sometimes will work retrieving voice message. Not sure if iPhone or device.,3,2
"These earbuds are a decent value, but the fit in my ear causes me not to use them as much as I would like.  The sound is pretty good and the buds fit snuggly in the ear, however, they create a suction effect and when I take them out, they pop very loudly.  Maybe my ears are just more sensitive than other's, but this is an uncomfortable feeling.  They are not uncomfortable to wear, and like I said, for the money, the sound is adequate.  I will probably be purchasing another pair of sony MDR-EX71 headphones.",3,2
I brought this with the intent of waking up every morning to my favorite song. However it does not operate like that  but what it does is allow me to travel with my music. I take this with me everytime I travel so I can listen to my mp3 player in my hotel room or visting friends and family that do not have portable mp3 players so I can listen to my music a out loud. If you are going outside the US most hotels not not have mp3 players you can use in your room. So think like this small radio or bulky laptop or speakers.,3,1
It didn't work for my first generation Apple TV.  The light on the box would flicker when I tried to use it be no response.,3,2
"This is the one I want for my car. I don't want to remove my OEM car CD and Cassette.<br />Also I don't want battery power. So, I just choose this one and that was good enought.<br />I love it. Idea was great, I like USB power. (I don't want battery power)<br /><br />But built in USB card reader is too slow. Also micro SD adapter is not good enought, I just used my owne.<br />All material are not that good. But everything is working. I love to lisening MP3 music in my car.",3,1
"The description is not clear exactly what features you are getting. Also what is pictured is not accurate. The LCD screen pictured does not come with this model and the unit I received is not black, it is beige/tan. The label on the side of my unit states input 230v, but the description on Amazon said 110v. It took several emails to clear this up, because they first told me that I ordered the 230v. Turned out the label was wrong. They did respond to all my emails each day, so at least I was able to get everything clarified (eventually). I will order from them again, but I would email them first for a quote with exactly what specs and features I want. To date, I have run several larger loads to test the unit, but nothing above 1500 watts yet. The quality seems good thus far and hope the engineering is better than their postings and communications.",3,1
"This is not really what I expected. I live in Fairfield, OH and it's hard to find a channel that makes the music sound crystal clear. I've found one channel that works okay. The quality is alright but I expected better. For the price it made it worth the purchase and I will continue to use it but come time when I have the money to replace it, I am going to get a better one from maybe Best Buy or Walmart.",3,1
"This was a good case, the holster is tight, and there is NO stylus pen at all. I like this case and i would recommend it to others",3,1
"I bought this bundle because I wanted a cover for my Nook Color that would hold several microSD cards so I could expand my library and keep all of my Nook accessories together. It does that, but I discovered that when I put my NC in the cover that one of the vinyl straps covers the headphone jack. It also covers the volume buttons, but that's not a big deal because it doesn't cause any problems with the audio. I also was not able to apply the screen protector without having several air bubbles even though I followed the package directions. Other than those, I didn't notice any other problems with my purchase. I do love the stylus, although it will take some getting used to.",3,1
"It does what it is supposed to and that is keep my iPod on my arm. I do like the item, but I would have loved it if I could charge it in the watch. It is somewhat difficult to get the iPod seated in the device correctly. Not so difficult that it keeps me from using it daily. I am very pleased with the product and am glad I purchased it.",3,1
"I purchased this unit to replace my factory one that quit playing CD. The installation was quick and easy. About 30min witha dash kit and wiring harness. I was excited for the USB, SD card slot and auxiliary input. An obvious upgrade from my factory CD player.<br />Here's the Pros<br />-Price is decent<br />-blue lighting is bright and stylish<br />-USB port, SD card slot<br />-Havnt had a CD skip yet.<br />-<br />Here's the Cons.<br />-CD player fails often to fully eject CDs first try.<br />-Random memory loss loosing saved stations and settings.<br />-Loud setting doesnt seem to do anything for CDs.<br />-The menu and settings are more trouble than they are worth.<br />-Sometimes it wants to stay on even after I shut the vehicle off and exit.<br />-limited audio settings.<br /><br />Summary: I may have just got a crappy unit. But its still an upgrade from what I had. I wish I had saved up another $20-$30 for something better. Regardless I will still use the heck out of it....",3,1
"If you plan to use this for deep water boating, this replicates paper charts and will be very good, but if you get this for shallow water boating such as kayaking, most of the areas you may want to travel are not covered. I wanted it for the Chesapeake Bay and the inland bays off the Atlantic on the Delmarva peninsula. The open bay and regular channels are well covered, but if you fish in shallow waters near the shore and islands, its value diminishes. Islands and marshes that are subject to erosion or transition are not well defined. A satellite image is much more accurate. It would be nice if they overlaid a satellite image with markers and depths.",3,1
"I bought this to go with a BB2 boombox and in order to make it fit I had to remove the stabilizing piece from the boom box and the receiver does not fit in securely and could easily break off. I would not recommend this receiver for the boombox but it might be fine if you will be using it in a car. It also does not display the time as far as I can figure out, but that could be a settings issue.",3,2
This card Is alright had no promblems with it play single player games perfect and some multiplayer games like world of tanks and csgo. A few multiplayer games that it really can't Andle is Planetside to and some h1z1 in planetside it's good when you are alone but in massive battle it blows,3,1
Does not fit perfectly . I have hold it tight or keep something on top of the cable to make it work when i plug it to my mac . does work with the plug perfectly .,3,1
"I enjoy the shade of pink of the case. It is a decent quality for the price and does feel cheap, yet durable (though with the way that it opens and closes, I'm afraid the flap that folds back will rip at some point). I don't like that the latch just hovers at the side while you're reading, I feel like it's kinda awkward when I'm using the page turn buttons to turn the page. Though I did accidentally drop my nook onto my wooden floor with a well sounding 'thump' last night. The case was on it and it was perfectly fine, so no complains here about that.",3,1

"The GSI backup battery with the solar charging feature works very well after pumping it up with a cable to your computer, but don't plan on getting much recharging with the sun.  It does recharge from exposing the unit to the sun, but slowly.  I carry this backup battery when traveling, but I don't depend on the sun to charge it up. That is why I gave it only three stars.<br /><br />I suppose if one is camping or hiking in the wilderness away from a computer or a wall charger the solar function would return some small amount of juice to the unit.  Otherwise the GSI solar backup battery is not much better than a Stitchway Ultrapower (much cheaper) charger.  I also own one of the Stitchway units and it works well too. It just doesn't pretend to suck energy out of the sun.",3,1

Sound quality and radio is much worse than the original CD player. Poor menu and settings. But good thing is that it fits very good to original place.,3,1
It's nice and plays my cds very well  It is easy to use and portable. I use it for my yoga and meditation practice.,3,1
"Bought this last winter and just got around to installing it. I was leery after reading the reviews, so I opened it up. One small phillips screw and the case pops open.<br /><br />Inside I found a small circuit board, inexpensively made with through-hole components. I could see several capacitors and inductors that looked vulnerable to vibration. So I warmed up my hot-melt glue gun and potted all the components on the circuit board into place. Took about 5 minutes including re-assembly. Epoxy would have worked as well.<br /><br />Installed it on my 74 Suzuki GT550 and so far, it works like a charm. Wouldn't fit inside the headlight shell but I was able to tuck it in behind the headlight bucket mounting ears and secure it using a couple of wire ties.<br /><br />I found a plastic cap to protect the USB connector from the elements, and I strap the connector to the Nuvi mount when not in use.<br /><br />Time and miles will tell how it holds up. The bike is an old two-stroke, without the benefit of modern suspension, so vibration will be a factor.",3,1
Its a good product and im gland that I brought it. I look forward to purchasing more in the futher,3,1
Medium quality. but for $12 its good,3,1
"A fair product, and a great price.  Very basic unit - but does all that I require - just voice.  It works well, when it works, and makes handsfree calls so much easier.  Often it will take some considerable time to recognise the phone when wihin range (ie. sitting in the drivers seat). And now occasionally, after several weeks of use, there is no volume (in either direction) when an outgoing call is initiated. Unit must be turned off/on during the call in order to re-establish volume.  Would not buy again and don't recommend to any one.  (And of course, it doesnt work with iPhone).",3,1
"Decent sound but in hindsight I think it's very overpriced. I heavily considered returning it but decided to just keep it. I wish I had returned it now. It came highly recommended by a friend, but now I truly believe you're just paying for the name -- and that's not reason enough for me. Oh well.",3,1

"I can not complain very much since I only paid a penny for this car charger; however the product was suppose to be new.  The actual car charger looked new, but did work like it was new.  I am not returning an item I purchased for a penny, because one of the ports do work.  The company should double check to make sure both ports are in working order before shipping.  The SF Planet company was very quick about shipping my order, and I believe they do strive to maintain an honorable business; they sent me an information sheet with my product that had all of the company's info and their return policy.  They also wanted to receive a positive rating from me, which proves the company really tries to ship reliable products.",3,2
"It has been a month since I bought this product. As other reviewers wrote all the good things about it I will write some problems I have experienced since I got it.<br /><br />1.

However, I don't see any problem with electric.<br />3. My Motorola Photon 4G gets only 50% recharged with 100% charged solar charger.<br />4.

Could have been shorted out when I recently changed my battery, but everything else is still working fine, so I don't think that's the case.",3,1
"I love the idea of the Reader and have thoroughly enjoyed using it.    My problem with it, however, is that the processor is very slow.  It wasn't bad at first but the more books I add, the slower the processor becomes.    I believe this product is touted as being able to store 350 books on it.  I have only about 20 downloaded to it and the device is bogged down enough to the point where I feel I need to write a review about what I see as a severe limitation.    Also, the website has only a few of the books I have searched for.  If you are looking for mainstream books or novels I'm sure you'll be fine but I tend to read a lot of literature on foreign policy and U.S./world history.  So far I have been disappointed in the percentage of hits I've received in my searches.    On the positive side, I like the ability the Reader give me to take notes and look back on them later.",3,1
My merchandise arrived in a timely matter and was packaged well. The case looks pretty on my Ipod. The only thing I am disappointed in is that it scratches really easy and the dark color shows this.,3,1
"I give this product 3 stars because it doesn't have an attachment for iPhone 5 , otherwise it is excellent. I just use the cord that came with my phone  and attach it to this products usb slot.",3,1
Took quite some time to get radio and did not come with remote,3,1
Spotty performance and not a quality product!,3,2
thought it would cover more the glare but not bad for what i paid.,3,2
"First, I really like the quality and the color of this cover. It is easy to use and comfortable to hold.  The issue I have with it is, literally, a missing hole.    My iPod Touch has a light sensor to adjust the screen visibility.  Apparently the light sensor is right under a solid piece (or 2) of leather.      I take my iPod with me when I go out and often read while I'm waiting.  With this cover, in order to be able to actually see the screen, I have to take the iPod out of the cover so the light sensor can adjust the screen.    If I was just listening, this would not be an issue, other than the need to actually use the controls.    Keep this in mind if you add it to your shopping cart.     I'll continue to use the cover when I take the iPod for extended travel, but for my daily use, I won't use it.  Wastes too much time taking it off and putting it on every time I need to access the machine.",3,1
"Seems to function great but, before I even left the house the first time the clip pulled out of the back of the mic. It was s bit loose to begin with. I'm thinking save your cash for something with a little more build quality.",3,1
"This product feels cheaply made and doesn't support viewing in different angles.    If you're looking for a cheap stand for an iPad that just does the basics, I would get this. It looks like a regular iMac stand (complete with a hole in the back to put your cords through) and does seem to support the iPad fairly well.     If you're looking for something that is top build quality, keep on looking. This stand wouldn't win any awards.",3,2
"Rubbery soft material but sits very loose on the ipod. The bottom folds over while you hold the ipod. When you are playing it, it pulls off of the sides as well. Will be shopping for a different one.",3,2
"I gave this 3 stars having never actually turned it on.  This is NOT compatible with a 2012 dodge grande caravan w/stow n go.  The headrest on the 2012 dodge have airbag components in them and cannot be removed without throwing a code and shutting off the airbag system.  Again, NOT compatible with 2012 dodge grande caravan with stow n go.",3,2
they are ok,3,1
"I received the package as promised and was very happy with the looks and turning it on and checking settings,etc. The issue I have is I can not get the music downloaded onto the player. I have tried dragging from Windows Media Player to the folder, I have tried to Sync. I am told it is done but when I go to listen to the music it is not on my player. I have had one previous to this and did not have a problem loading music. Unfortunately my granddaughter lost it and I had to buy a new one. The reason I picked this player vs the 16GB I previously had was due to the camera option. I dont think I received the same manual as the rest of you did. My manual did not give clear instructions regarding playing the music and absolutely no instructions regarding the camera. I figured out the camera, I think. I have to click to take the picture then make sure everyone stays still while it counts down from 5 then snaps the picture. I want to be able to take a picture instantly.   So, my son has the player and he and his girlfriend are trying to figure out how to load the music onto it. If they can get that done then I will be happy.",3,1
"This case is so dark blue it's almost black and the \\""M\\"" and \\""MICHIGAN\\"" are fairly lightly stamped on in white. You wouldn't even know it was a Michigan case without looking closely. I bought this as a Christmas gift for someone that specifically asked for it. If I had bought it for myself, I would have returned it.",3,2
"I had decided that I wanted an EReader, but didn't have a lot of money to spend, so did a lot of research.  The Aluratek EReader caught my eye because of the price.  Then a little more research led me to the Libre 7 Inch Color Multi-Media - EBook Reader,  I reviewed a number of customer reviews and found that some people loved it, although some had defective models and had to send them back and at least one person complained bitterly about the customer service.  Like most gamblers, I hoped that the negative experiences wouldn't apply to me.    When mine arrived I was thrilled with it and immediately began reading downloaded library books.  However, the first problem I noticed was that the back button didn't work at all.  I learned to just turn the reader totally off and on again to get to previous screens.  Then I began to (try to) use the music component and found that the speakers / sound was defective.  I wasn't content just to use ear buds when there is an actual speaker.      So, began another adventure.  I called the Amazon Vendor who had sold it to me (Roger, Heartland Computer in Omaha, NE), and I couldn't have been happier with his response, which was that he would gladly exchange it for a fully working model.  In the mean time I promised to contact Aluratek Customer Service, just in case they could help me to correct the problems.    This is where my experience became very unpleasant.  I used the Aluratek customer service trouble ticket system.  They told me to update the firmware and directed me to a utube video found at [...]  Said video was very hard to follow, so I took the time to transcribe it word for word.  Then it didn't work because a file was missing.  In trying to resolve the problem I found an instruction file in the download that gave the correct name of the file to finish the updating, however, I couldn't find the \\""new\\"" file in the download.  By this time I was grumpy and very irritated and had spent $29.95 to update my WinZip Account, so complained about this and the fact that (1) incorrect instructions had been given through the utube video (2) the cost of updating WinZip and (3) that all of the required files didn't seem to be available in the download.  At this point I realized that Aluretek never taught it's \\""customer service\\"" reps that the customer is always right, as the communication went from bad to worse with the rep finally telling me to please close the ticket.  Eventually, after downloading the firmware update three times and spending a great deal of time and experiencing deep frustration, I was able to update the firmware.  Following the update I did notice some new bells and whistles in the software, but the primary problems were not resolved.  Back button still did not work, nor did the speaker.)    Therefore, I had to go to further expense and bother by returning the device via UPS and am awaiting my new Aluratek Libre 7in Color Multi-Media - EBook Reader.  I do hope the new one works as described, because I did enjoy it as an EBook Reader.      I'm very grateful to Roger at Heartland Computer, who either read the books or is a naturally talented customer service provider.",3,2
"Nice speaker, sounds good. Does not work for 6 hours without charging though.<br />Indicator light does not let you know when fully charged.<br />Otherwise happy with purchase.",3,1
"The design are cute & my girls love them, but not all the necessary cut outs were available. The power button & volume buttons were not accessible.",3,1
"I bought the black case. Once the iPod goes in the case looks very nice, flat, and professional as I expected. Once you start using the device it’s a different story. Once you press the on/off button the device shifts and the camera does not align with the opening for it. Every time I want to take a picture I have to slide the iPod from the side to make sure the camera and flash are centered in the opening. The side edges of the screen opening bulge out a little, you don’t get that nice straight edging around the screen.<br />On the positive side, I like the way the magnets keep the cover closed. In spite of the negatives I just pointed out I still think it’s well worth the money and the general practicality and appearance  of the case compensate for the inconveniences. Maybe those inconveniences are not that a big deal for you. Actually they are not for me either but I just got surprised because I was not expecting them. To me any cover for the iPod is an inconvenience anyway. I just buy covers to protect the device and I don’t want to use a cheap looking plastic case on such a nice looking and sophisticated electronic. So, inconvenience for inconvenience, I would go with this one.",3,1
"Well, this little thing does allow me to charge my phone and iPod in the car, which is what I bought it for.  One issue I've noticed is that it interferes with the radio.  This is annoying, but not a problem in really good reception areas.  It only causes radio fuzz when I'm driving along outskirt areas.",3,1
"The length of this cable was a big plus. It's also thicker and heavier duty than the OEM cables for the tablets and phones. The packaging was real nice too, kinda trying to meep up with Apple's packaging. The issue is that the plug end doesn't hold securely into either the phone or tablet. It falls out too easily, which doesn't work for me. The Apple cables stay in. Don't know if this was just the cable I bought or if they are all like this. Too bad, otherwise it would be a winner!",3,2
The case itself is fine but the stylus was damaged. I didn't think it was worth sending it back for that. My wife didn't need the stylus anyway.,3,2
"Brand new in package. All parts for installation went well. Dust free and clean is very obvious to see when I open the packet. Install as normal with two sides to peel off. I applied three as soon as I got my order ( of 3 ) and all thee are perfect with no white star dust  or anything. This is my first time to use less than TOP GRADE material , and it looks great ! Feels good. I feel safe with some protection now. CON it might be seen as a very light shad through the material cover. I an not sure of this but I might be. Also I noticed high oil pickup. So there is always oil smears or finger prints All the time. Guess that is what the cloth is for !! Maybe this is normal but I have never had this problem be for. On any of my toys ( eREADER phones tablet or ipod ) if you have dry skin or dry finger tips, This should work out great.oh I want to say that everything is clear and sharp using this on ipod and phone.",3,1

"I just recieved my shoqbox. The sound is great and I had no problem with getting the system started. My biggest problem was the Music Matchbox program. That programs is difficult to use. Extremely user unfriendly. I spent about four hours trying to figure it out (the amount it takes to fully charge the system). It's extremely slow to transfer music onto it, once you figure it out. After that, its a cool little system. Phillip should figure out how to get a better program than Matchbox and now yahoo music.",3,2
"I recieved this as a shower gift. I was very pleased with the scrubbing power of the rotating brush-squirter action, but the suction is lacking on this thing.

It did get out a particularly nasty stain, so I am satisfied.",3,1

However one prong of the charger is stuck in the socket, but the charger is usable but can't be unplugged.  Screen protector was a disappointment. IT was not cut properly so could not stick to the screen and touch screen part was unusable after sticking it. Just discarded it.",3,2

"A great bargain for the 3 pack, but one cable has already failed in less than a month, also they need to be a inch longer even though you buy them knowing they are 5 inches thats from tip to tip so the cable is actually pretty short. otherwise great to use to connect to laptop or charge in car if you have bluetooth.",3,1
Nice...,3,1
Just installed the unit into my 1994 Pontiac Bonneville today - I agree that the joystick control is quite the cause of frustration.  Even in the fifteen hours I've had it in my car I have had trouble using some of the features.  The auxiliary input is perfect for me and provides much clearer sound than a tape-deck adapter ever could.  The unit gives great sound and once it is set up works perfectly as it should.  The only issue with the product is changing your options and viewing information on-the-fly (while driving).  Looking over at the unit to try and control the small joystick is quite the dangerous task when driving your vehicle.,3,1
This product did not seal tightly on the cable.,3,2
"Earbud colors really looked cool, but deceiving!  Fits awkward! Buds kept falling out of ear. Sounds not as impressive as the headphones unlike the Apple earbuds. Not happy & had to return it the next day...:(",3,2

"The case itself is very strong and durable, but it did little in the way of protecting the screen of my son's new iPod Touch 5th Generation he just received for Christmas. He dropped it and the screen just shattered. Still works fine, but it is going to cost $99 to repair the face of his iPod through the Apple Store. Makes me wish I'd purchased an extended warranty on it when I bought it.",3,1
"This case is great if you want some Otterbox-'LIKE' protection combined with the ability to show off your iPhone 4 (I know I'm not the only one who thinks that way! lol) but unfortunately, I'm going to return it. Although the case protected my phone pretty good, it was more of a hindrance than a help. NONE of my headphones or auxiliary cords fit into the cut-outs for the head phone jack and that is a problem for me because I use my iPod app quite frequently. Because of that, whenever I wanted to plug my phone into the radio or listen to music with my headphones, I was faced with taking the case off and this case is a N-I-G-H-T-M-A-R-E to take off. I feels as you're gonna break the phone in half. The last time I took it off, the back of my phone came off with it. I'm going back to my Otterbox Defender. In fact, I'm gonna return this case and use the money to buy a colored Otterbox. (They didn't have them in colors when I originally ordered them. Hope this helped! :)",3,1
"The charger and cable arrived on time and are decent quality. The cable works fine, the same as an Apple branded one. I don't see any difference. The charger, however, gives me the same error on my phone and two others in my household.

Hook them into another charger that we have, and they're fine.    Well, we just swapped this USB charger for one that we use for a different device. It works great with that other device so it was a wash. For the price, it was worth it to get the cable!",3,1
It would work if the solar could get through the window.  Panels are inside the window and in all of my windows it will not get enough rays to run likely due to built in window tint.,3,2

"I have an iPod 5G 30GB.  The device fits perfectly in the case.  However there are two major problems.  The opening for the USB cable connect is not aligned properly with the device.  This makes it so I have to jiggle the cable to get it in.  Also, there is no way to control the device easily if you are doing two things at once.  You can't change tracks very easily because the magnet is very strong and keeps it shut very well.  (This could also be a plus.)",3,1

"Decent low price mp3 player.  I have a couple hundred hours of use on this player. I have owned perhaps a dozen players over the years.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Small and a good price.  I like to keep a couple of sub $20 dollars players filled and charged up in my pocket for listening whenever.<br />Allows you to set up folders for your music and your podcasts.<br />Has a display that lets you pick what track you are looking for.  Hard to read details on the tiny display.<br />Radio works OK, but I use it mostly for playing MP3s<br /><br />Iffy:<br />Not the brightest of screens. Plastic scratches easily.<br />Modal menu system will take you teen minutes to figure out. Different behavior when you are playing and when you are paused.<br />The fast forward only takes you forward about 2X speed - which can be a problem if you want to skip to the mid point in a hour long podcast.  The large on/off button on the front of the player will place a marker in the track you are listening to, which allows you to start where you left off. The on/off  switch on the side wipes out this market. Don't use it if you want to save your place where you are listening to.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Lots of tiny navigation buttons almost flush on the side of the player are hard to work by feel in the dark. I fixed this by putting tiny bumps of epxoxy on buttons oh the periphery.",3,1

"I am a musician and have been running sound boards for over 10 years. I say that to try and qualify myself as having at least a decent ear for sound quality. I am a new subscriber to satellite radio and had hoped since it was a digital signal that the sound would be good, if not great. Mine has been neither. I can only speak for my unit, Starmate 4. I tried to avoid any static from the FM tranmitter so I wired it in to my receiver from the get-go. Many songs sound like a poor quality stream over the Internet, while some other songs on the same channel don't sound as bad. Typically the sounds is similar to a 98 kb/s rip or less on your computer. Hope your experience is better than mine.",3,2
I've owned this watch for a while and been pretty happy with this durability.  I'm very hard on my watches (I'm a firefighter) so I need something strong.  The watch looks nice but I have a few complaints.  For the money I would expect the second hand to line up with the second marks.  It didn't.  Not the end of the world but an indication of overall quality.  The black coating rubs off.  I had many parts of the band that were silver from the black wearing off.  The main pin on either side of the watch body where the strap attaches seems weak.  It's broken off my wrist twice.  The first time as I slammed onto the floor after a wet floor slip (oops). The impact was pretty hard so I can understand a bit.  The second time was today.  Now its at the bottom of a lake.  I was shocked it broke off while wakeboarding.  I'll be giving Luminox a try now.,3,2
Prefer the lightning sinc type. This is a regular charger and is VERY SLOW! I prefer to spend more money and get the lightning sinc,3,2

"This product was great for the first little while. I originally purchased this for a vacation trip where I wouldn't always have an outlet. Problem was, the External battery only charges about half of my phone before it needs to be recharged. I did like the fact that it had many different connections so it could be used to charge many different devices, had an attached flashlight and that it was easy to transport. Unfortunately mine broke when I went to recharge it, the input port detached itself and fell inside the battery pack.",3,2
"I use this with my 2011 Sonata and an iPhone 4. It charges my phone just fine. Audio is clear.<br /><br />Major gripe I have is the cable I have seems to have a wiring problem. If the cable is twisted at all the sound goes from stereo to mono.<br /><br />As far as controlling your music and podcasts with the in-car controls don't expect much beyond FF/RW by holding the button or skipping to the next track by tapping the FF/RW on your steering wheel. The annoying thing is you cannot access the music controls on your device while plugged in. The screen is whited out with a disclaimer saying your iPhone is being controlled by another device.<br /><br />If you listen to mainly podcasts I would suggest an app called Downcast. For $2 it does an excellent job of refreshing and organizing all your podcasts. It is MUCH better than the feeble official Apple podcast app. Best of all unlike the built-in music app you can access your podcasts through your phone while plugged in so you can switch to a different podcast, play one out-of-order, or FF in 15 sec, 30 sec, or 2 min increments.",3,1
"The crystal case protects my ipod fairly well from nicks and cracks, and since I drop my ipod once in a while, it still works just fine. But if you're the kind of person who constantly drops your ipod everyday, then you may want to look for a different case. Also, the case leaves the screen \\""open,\\"" which may be why they included the screen protector.    I haven't used the car charger yet, so I don't know how well it charges.    On the other hand, the wall charger works quite well, so I'm able to use that to charge my ipod when the usb ports are in use.    For the screen protector, I would suggest having someone with a steady hand to place the screen protector on the ipod, and even if placed carefully, you may end up with some air bubbles. Other than that, the screen protector does its job quite well; any scratches is on the screen protector instead of my ipod.",3,1

works sometimes,3,1
works great no problems remote is a big plus because i have it in a place where I cant reach it to turn it off<br /><br />only small thing is the resolution is 800x480 and can scale down resolutions above that didn't quite catch this when reading the product description.,3,1

"It was a pretty good little speaker and would have worked for what I needed it for at the moment. It sounded great using the line in, but the bluetooth connection was bad. I tried it with a couple different sources, to no avail.<br /><br />Don't bother with G-Project's email/website support. It took them 4 days to reply. Just call them. Oh, also the package inserts had the wrong URL for their website too. Very embarrassing.<br /><br />As for the actual device, like I said, aside from the Bluetooth problems, it had pretty good sound. It's not quite as loud as the JBL Flip2 I replaced it with, but it was loud enough. It's also very sturdy. The rubberized ends and squareness make it pretty stable in a moving vehicle as well.",3,1
"What I like about this:  It's small and discreet, it has a battery so it's more portable and can be moved without stopping the recording.  Picture quality is good and there are a variety of settings for picture quality for a variety of different uses.<br /><br />What is OK about it:  It's a little wonky in making changes to the settings and the instructions aren't the best.  It takes a little getting used to and exploration to get the settings to your satisfaction.<br /><br />What I don't like about it:  The mounting system<br /><br />I use this for a variety of purposes as a delivery driver and in my personal life.  The mount would be good for use in a single vehicle, but to move it from car to car (as I do delivering items and in my personal car) requires purchasing more than one mount and, if you want a mount with the GPS (which is required if you want to use the GPS feature on it) can become costly.  Also putting a double sided sticky pad on a car that you don't own may not go over well with the owner.  A mounting system more versatile and less permanent would be nice.  I've been testing different ways to mount it to meet my needs with some Gear Ties from Home Depot with mixed success.<br /><br />I like the battery in it because that lets me use while biking, recording my rides when I want to.  Though for this use it has stopped recording video after about 1/2 hour or so, the progress bar (on playback) still moves indicating it was still active, but it just showed a single image.  This didn't seem to happen when I had it plugged in and recording for long periods of time though.<br /><br />Audio quality seems to be decent.<br /><br />For less than $100 I can't expect a super high quality dashcam, it performs well enough for my purposes without spending a lot of money or buying different devices for different uses.",3,1

"I spend way too much time commuting so chatting with my daughter while she commutes makes the drive a tad more bearable.  Overall, this product does what it says it will do but only just so.  Backlit  buttons would be extremely helpful for winter evening commutes.  It is actually easier to use the phone with its lit buttons than the dark Supertooth which defeats the purpose of having a hands free. There is often interference from other calls and  many people seem to join in on our chats - Darth Vader, as we like to call them, is often present but unintelligible.  The Supertooth utilizes your phone's voice recognition program which in my case is unreliable.  So, when looking for a new handsfree, I will try to find lit buttons, eliminate Darth, and find built-in and hopefully more accurate voice recognition program.

"Edit: mine started charging again (not sure why it ever stopped), and so, because of the excellent radio and good sound quality, I'm bumping this to 3 stars.<br /><br />This is my review for the [[ASIN:B00RJW5U02 green 16GB version]], which is identical to this aside from the color and the micro SD card size. If you do buy one, look at the various colors and 16GB vs 8GB offerings to see what your best pricing option is that day - they fluctuate.<br /><br />I wanted to like this. I too owned the iPod nano this is so clearly meant to replicate. I was offered a free sample for evaluation, and I was excited to get it. I've spent many weeks trying to decide if I should evaluate it, but I've been pushed to do so by Charles Spanky's brave 1-star review (on the green 16GB version) as well as my brother's much higher four-star rating (likewise, for that color). Plus... I'm just tired of the need to review it hanging over my head.<br /><br />So... why two stars instead of the one that Charles gave?<br /><br />Because this item does have some nice aspects to it. You get a 16GB micro SD card, a mini USB cable (useful for 15 year old devices you find in drawers, perhaps), earbuds (low quality, but serviceable), and a fun little puzzle (&#34;how to I get this darned thing to work?&#34;). You also get a surprisingly decent audio recorder and an FM radio that actually sounds fantastic with better headphones plugged in. Music sounds really good as well. I mean, truly, genuinely good. I wasn't expecting that.<br /><br />So, why two stars instead of the four my brother gave?<br /><br />Because I fear that rating it higher would kill the little that remains of my soul. This just isn't, in my opinion, a four star device, even at $25. Maybe it's worth half that... maybe it's a four-star $12.50 device, because then you could part it out upon its death and recoup your expenses. Maybe.<br /><br />But... look, I love tech. I love love love love tech. I have more phones than fingers. I get giddy around anything mechanical or that consumes (or generates) power. I'm excited by this sort of stuff usually, even the low-end things. But I just cannot stand this one. The button-circle-control thingy is *horribly* inaccurate/laggy/inconsistent. The movie player only plays movie formats that no one living has except maybe on a PC from 1994 somewhere in their basement. Ebooks? Um, no. Even if you could manage to get one on-screen, the control pad would make reading it unbearable. Music plays great... but the 1999 folder scheme has been out of date since the first iPod and is - again - near useless when using the control pad to navigate it.<br /><br />Worst of all: the thing died on me. I let it run out of charge, and now it cannot be used when not plugged in. It simply will not hold a charge for even a second's worth of playing - it's like there is no battery at all. I've tried charging at 500mA, at 1A, and at 2A. Nothing. So, as little as this was worth as a $25 device, it's worth less as a $25-plus-external-battery device.<br /><br />If it played movies in formats known to modern humans, I'd rate it higher. If the directory structure made finding music easier, I'd rate it higher. If the control pad worked well, or if it used micro USB, or if it didn't die after going uncharged for a few days, or if it came with a 64GB micro SD card, I'd rate it higher. As it is, I just can't.<br /><br />You want something better? New prepaid cellphones are often near this price and will perform so much better. Not long ago, the nice-for-the-price now-discontinued [[ASIN:B00E45043A Nokia 520]] was $20. The fantastic [[ASIN:B00HPP3QD6 Moto G]] has been as low as $25. I own both of these, and they ABSOLUTELY BLOW THIS OUT OF THE WATER and can do everything this can (except the Moto G doesn't use a micro SD card).<br /><br />Look around at prepaid cellphones. They are cheap, and many will do everything this does and more. Buy one of them instead...<br /><br />...unless you like much frustration and occasional intermittent joy. If that's you, buy this. The form factor also works for spreading garlic butter on bread, so there's that.butter on bread, so there's that.",3,1

"Its alright. Not that bad and not that good either. The functions are kind of slow and the volume (with out the ear phones) is low. (Like even running water noise can be heard over it). Its also kind of a pain to covert every video, if you want to put it in there. Also,the player doesn't have a slot for the stylus, so you might lose it. Other than that, I like the music functions, also the radio functions. I recommend for younger teens or for people who don't wanna pay too much. Its a fair product.",3,2
"I seen a black dude try to sneak these out in his poop shoot out of the electronic store.  He looked like a pimp, wearing his cheezy outfit, and driving a van.  He almost got away with it, until the store clerk noticed a gigant circle under his pants, as the entire back side of the enormous 22\\"" speaker was already deep inside his black poop shoot.  This is the same guy that attempted to walk out in the very same way out of the grocery store with 4 water-melons inside his bum.",3,1
"While this case is nicely made with 3 belt loops(2 loops and 1 hook)and a nice Velcro closure, it's too thick to really hold my thin Garmin 3790 GPS securely. While the Garmin is 3/8\\"" thick (by 4 3/4w X 2 3/4h\\"") this case is made for something 7/8\\"" thick (by 4 3/4\\""w X 3 1/8\\""h). Everything other than the thickness seems OK for my Garmin but I really think this is made for one of the older(thicker) GPS units. Too bad, otherwise it seemed like a decent case.  I was also thinking this case could be used for my Samsung Galaxy 4.0 MP3 player but again while length and width are OK the thickness is just too much to hold it securely. I'm going to try and return it but wonder how much shipping will cost to send it back :( While $11 including shipping isn't terrible, I just can't think of a reason to keep it.  Edit: return went OK and Amazon even gave me a ticket to give UPS to ship it back for free. Too bad, it was really a nice case for a thicker device.",3,2
"I would recommend this product only if you are a woman.  I bought this for my husband, and it barely fits around his bicep.

If you are a woman or a smaller-armed guy, this product is a great value!  iPod fits fine and buttons are usable while in the armband.",3,1
"(Actually, I'd give this a 3.5 rating, if they had that option.) <br />I do like this MP3 player, but I should have done some more research before buying.  I was looking for an MP3 player to use while working out, but I also wanted an MP3 player that I can store hundreds of songs on so that I never have to keep swapping songs in-and-out off of my computer (just throw them all on the MP3 player and go).  Unfortunately, you can't have both.  I thought this MP3 player would be fine to work out with, but found out (after buying it) that the H320 doesn't have a \\""workout band\\"" or \\""clip\\"" or anything that you could use while working out.  Now, it DOES come with a leather carrying case with a clip, but it's not made to work out with (I've tried).  For one, the MP3 player is a bit too big to work out with, even if there was a good workout case for it. <br /> <br />Pros:  It does store a helluva a lot of songs, and the sound is pretty good.  The color display is nice, and the FM stereo is a great feature (I didn't want to get an MP3 player without an FM player).  The drag-and-drop feature on your computer to the MP3 player is nice and easy, too. <br />Cons:  Not for working out with.  The iRiver FM transmitter I bought with it to play in my car really sucks.  The sound quality is bad.  Also, the buttons on the H320 aren't set up so that you can just reach out and change the volume or song quickly and easily, without looking at the controls. <br />",3,1
"Very pleased with this product. It arrived quickly, and has met the requirements I have for it.<br />I would recommend this product.",3,1
"Good product for the money. Feels a little cheap but works as intended.    Only issue I had was wiring. As some of the other reviews mentioned; \\""The Manual is pretty much useless\\"". I do however understand that the supplier cannot possibly provide a wiring schematic for ALL types of vehicles. It took some trial and error, but I got mine working with the wires that came with the unit and the Minivan. I have a 2003 Chrysler Town & Country.     Good luck! :)",3,1
"I received this product in hope of installing it on a Pickup Tailgate Handle. To an extent the description is correct, but there are flaws. The camera is intended to be used so that the camera points down and this is true, it would work great on a tailgate handling look pretty close to an OEM solution. I just tested this camera with the TV in my living room and the flaw I found was that if there is something on the left (driver) side of your vehicle, the object would show up on the right side of the monitor. My other vehicles have factory installed backup cameras, and show it the other way around. I was looking for a reversed image but this camera is not capable of doing so. It did have the red, yellow, and green guide lines, and seemed to be durable and had decent quality (hooked up to a 32&#34; tv). For under $20.00 this is a great product, but for the picky people like myself just move on and go for a higher quality product.",3,1

I have never been great at applying these things to any device. That being said this package only came with 2.  The first one that I put on there was dust or dirt speck  underneath so guess what a bubble. Tried the last cover and put on and once again air bubbles that will not leave.  Have read reviews on other screen protectors and this brand was never mentioned.  Wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this.  Reason I gave a 3 is I am not sure it is user error or product error.,3,2
"I really like the sound this metronome makes.  It is loud enough to hear no matter how loud you play.  It also has a lot of nice features.  A choice of tones to contrast with whatever instrument you are playing, a nice large LED light that flashing the rhythm that is very easy to see, and such features as a nice tap in button.  The big problem with this is that they somehow seriously screwed up on the tempo control.  This is a large knob on the front that you should be easily able to spin around to set the tempo.  The problem is its stuck and its stuck bad.  Its a good thing I play guitar so that I have fingernails on my right hand. Otherwise it would be impossible for me to exert enough force on the knob to actually change the tempo.  I noticed one person epoxied a handle on the knob.  I will probably have to do that as well.  Until they fix this problem this product will only be adequate at best.  Fortunately for Korg there ain't a lot of competition in the low priced metronome market.  Otherwise this product would be toast.",3,1

If you can get it for less than $20, including shipping, and have a bunch of flash cards sitting around, it is worth it. <br /> <br />The player works, but there are a couple annoyances with the file system support: 1. Make sure you do not put the mp3s in directories on the flash card, since the player can not find them. 2. Some of my music could not be read by the player, but it worked after I used a tagging program (MediaMonkey) to remove all the ID tags of the files after copying them over to flash. 3.

"Unfortunately the Chinese  haven't realized that all cars are not the same nor dose their mounting plates fit all cars. I installed the unit on a 2012 scion xB took 7 hours. Had to make mounting parts change the ends of the units wires solder connections make a filler plate, drill new mounting holes in the cars roof as the dome light clips in , NO screws. Anyway once the unit was installed it worked as advertised. I managed to burn out the dome light board on the unit and a replacement one is $55. I had purchased a Pyle unit prior to this one and to say the least it was a pile!!!! So be aware that these overhead DVD players mounting plates dont fit all cars as far as the mounting system goes and you may have to do allot of modifications in order for it to fit. There were other issues with the unit once mounted  but if u can deal with those once installed.... the ir audio worked good, video/audio in and out all worked as advertised. The picture quality is good and has a good viewing angle. Audio is good thru the speakers. The unit feels cheap as do most of the low cost players like this.",3,1

"I am a kindle owner and have been looking into the Sony Touch. My verdict is that the Sony is slightly inferior to the kindle. Though an interesting machine, its benefits are not as beneficial as one might think at first blush.     Quite simply, the Sony Touch can do just about everything that the Amazon kindle can do. One can highlight and annotate (with a stylus rather than a cursor). One can easily turn pages (with a thumb-flick rather than a button-press) and jump to sections of the book easily. And the Sony even has features the kindle does not have: one can draw on a blank 'page,' read .pdf files natively, zoom in on text by degrees, and download public domain google books...er...wait.     Here is where I interject by saying that many of these features really aren't as good as they first appear. Many people, for instance, are sold on the idea of being able to download any public domain google book. Allegedly, the kindle cannot do this...except for...it can! With help from some very free and easy-to-use software online (calibre), one can convert any downloaded google book into a file format that amazon recognizes. The conversion is easy, flawless, and gives the kindle user access to every google book that Sony owners can get.     Second, many people are sold on the touch screen. Imagine highlighting, annotating, and turning the page without having to use cumbersome buttons and cursors. But this sounds better than it is! The thumb-flick page-turning method, for instance, basically means that one must read with two hands (rather than reading with one on a kindle, where the page turn button is located where one's thumb can click it). And if you swipe your thumb too hard on the Sony screen, it thinks you want to highlight; too light, and it won't work. As for operating annotations with a stylus, this is no easier, harder, quicker, or slower than the kindle's cursor method.     The biggest drawback to the Sony Touch is the clumsy software and lack of selection. Every book available for the Sony (that I've checked) is available for the kindle at the same or lesser price. But by no means is the opposite true: every book available for the kindle is by no means available for the Sony. Long and short: the kindle simply has a better and more cost-effective selection of books. And in the week that I tried out my Sony Touch, the software malfunctioned three times.     I give the Sony Touch 3 stars because in many ways, it is the Kindle's equal. The screen is great, it is easy to use, its features are good, and its battery life is PHENOMENAL (one area where the Sony has the Kindle beat by far)! But the features that make the Sony seems like the favorite are, on closer examination, really not all that great. The kindle can, via conversion, access any public domain google book and the touchscreen is just as much trouble as it is an asset. And I have not noticed that the Sony handles .pdf files natively any better than the kindle does via conversion.     So, it is close to a toss-up but...it is the Kindle by a nose!",3,1
"And heavy. Yet it still slides. Nothing \\""Mini\\"" about it.<br /><br />The base is taller than expected and makes the Nuvi too high on the dashboard, blocking vision of the windshield more than the original mount.

"Pluses:<br />- It's cheap.<br />- It works.<br />Minuses:<br />- Usability is TERRIBLE - after a month I still don't know how to change playlist, it just plays all the songs in a row.<br />- Audio socket isn't isolated from water, sometimes short-circuts when wet and one speaker stops working. Fixable by unplugging and plugging speakers again.<br />- Headset leaks. I have no experience with others, but after ~10 min in water (with a silicon cap on my head) i have to stop and remove water from the speakers and my ears. Big problem if you're trying to swim continuously on longer distances.",3,2
The mount is easy to install and works fine and is definitely a good value. The problem is that if you're using this then it's likely you DON'T own a GPS specially designed for a motorcyle. This means that your GPS will most likely suffer from excessive glare and be impossible to read most of the time with the exception of at night or heavily overcast days.,3,1

It doesn't just link up, like a phone to hands free connection in your car.  You have to fiddle with the radio controls each time which defeats the purpose of not having to plug something in.  Like I said, the audio is fine and seems to have good oomph for a 26' boat.",3,1

Fits fine. Not sure how well protected my Ipod touch is with this. And the protector for the screen was a pain to apply without air bubbles,3,1

However, the hole for the front facing camera and the home button could definitely be more precisely cut.",3,2
"I bought a Griffin Roadtrip FM transmitter years ago and it was a great product. I hardly ever had any radio interference, even on stations that had existing signals - as soon as I turned this on, the radio went totally silent and I could enjoy the music from my Ipod. Then one day I was being a bit of a clutz and leaned over my seat and cracked the adapter plug, which cut all the wiring inside it. Stupidly, I replaced it with a cheap Belkin transmitter from Wal-Mart. Bad move. I got interference everywhere, on any and every frequency. No matter where it was in my car.     Then I bought this Satechi 6-in-1 FM Transmitter. It worked better than the cheap Belkin one, but not quite as good as this Griffin RoadTrip one; furthermore, my 30 gig video Ipod weighed too much for it and it kept flopping over if I hit some bumps on the road. Satechi's trasmitters are not held by a firm plastic cradle like Griffin RoadTrip does, and even though you could screw the joint on the Satechi one really tight, it will eventually loosen up and fold over on you again. After multiple times of the Satechi brand flopping over on me, it broke completely.     Hindsight 20/20, I should have replaced my first Griffin RoadTrip with another one.",3,1
"There's nothing better than listening to music while you work out. Now to be able to do that in the pool is even more amazing!<br />Unfortunately water does get onto the product & killing the sound (specially in the Right ear phone) putting a major dampener on the expected experience & my workout!! I actually called for another piece from HongKong (this order was from Japan) & the same problem persisted. Once the unit is dry, it workers like a charm.<br /><br />However if you like your music really really loud, please note this is not the loudest MP3 player even for an in-ear headphone.<br />I really wish it worked more consistently in the pool to really deliver on it's promise. Headphones could have been a little louder too (I have to use it at Max Volume) Other wise sound quality is good.<br /><br />It does not fall off, plus there is an added strap to give you a snug fit. Also comes with 4 sizes of ear plugs which is great to see what fits best. Transferring on Mac is really simple (drag & drop) from iTunes.<br /><br />Over all its worth a shot, however I only got this player for the pool experience which is not a 100%.

The splitter is one, the fishbone thing is another; just don't see much utility to either.  Not sure which package the black silicone case came from, but it's first rate (in fact, it might be the same in both).  The clear hard plastic case on the other hand just doesn't seem very useful to me.  On the other hand, the leather flip case does seem nice, though I haven't used it yet.  And the connector for an audio input works fine in our car that has the corresponding input jack.  Hard to go wrong at that price, but if you don't need all of this, consider similar, simpler packages.",3,1
I haven't used this yet...waiting for better weather up here in PA.  Let's hope spring gets here pretty soon - then I'll let you know.,3,1
"I like this product for the size and price. However, it does suffer from a lot of interference from other devices and folk walking in front of it.<br /><br />I travel a lot in Asia and often there is no iPod dock in the hotel rooms, I use the radio in the room to tune into a blank channel and then set this adapter to that channel to listen to my own music. Bur be aware that it is sometimes not easy to find a blank channel.<br /><br />All in all ok product for the price.",3,1

AFTER USING AND ENJOYING THE MODEL 250 I OPTED TO ORDER THE NAXA 256 WHICH HAS BETTER SOUND QUALITY OVER THE 250 MODEL BUT DOES NOT HAVE EARPHONE CAPABILITY. THE USB FUNCTION ON BOTH MODELS IS A MUST HAVE.I AM PLAYING A 10,000 SONG FLASH DRIVE WHICH TAKES ATLEAST 26 DAYS TO COMPLETE.IF YOU LOVE MUSIC AND KNOW HOW TO DOWNLOAD TO A FLASH DRIVE PURCHASE ONE OF THESE UNITS.

"I returned this box because, alas, it had no clock. With a clock, it would have been perfect for me. Can't say more about it because it went right back with NO hassle from Amazon.",3,2
I HAVE HAD OTHERS AND NOT THRILLED ABOUT THIS ONE. 1 SMALL LAMINATED PAGE. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND,3,2
The chargers work fine and the price was reasonable. The belt clip appeared to have a broken plastic piece. The arm carrier had no directions and I couldn't get it to work. The silicon case is ok but I'm not sure when to use it. My cell phone belt carrier and pockets work best for me.,3,2
Not bad for its price .,3,2
"Was hoping for a better quality sound from the speaker system, Its okay but with pair of upgraded speakers would be so much better. It  also has a power hungry amplifier  you get about 4 hours on a battery then performance really tanks!",3,1
I purchased this cover fro my Kindle Fire because I realized that I would have to clean the screen all the time.  I was very disappointed in the Marware Screen protector.  It was difficult to put on the Kindle Fire.,3,2
I purchased 2 for our NookHD  and I gave one to my 9 year old grandson<br />he loved it and was easy to set up.  The other one didn't work<br />on my Nook HD  paired but wouldn't type  and I decided to send it back<br />My grandson like it as he is trying to make presentations and the keyboard<br />works on his and the case it sharp except the closer flap is in your way when<br />you type but worth the money,3,1

"I just got my case today. Its okay. I'm just having the most difficult time putting on the case and removing it. You literally have to put every ounce of force possible into removing the case. However, I'm scared to do that in fear of breaking the case. It would be a lot easier if you could make these cases easier to apply and remove.",3,1
lame,3,1
Ok speaker for easy listening. But I don't do ANYTHING easy. So I bought a Bose!,3,1
I found this item to be just ok.  I had difficulty trying to get the bubbles out of it.  I am using it but the bubbles are a distraction for me.  I will continue to use it for the protection of the screen until I can find a better product.,3,2
This product is okay.. It would have been nice if they made it very clear that this product will not work unless you separately purchase a battery pack. Which FYI... Cost a lot of money!! Pretty embarressing to give as a Christmas gift when it cant even work.. At least make it clear that a second purchase is necessary! Not really worth it!,3,2
"Works well enough, but screws always vibrate out, if you are going to buy this item make sure you get the stabilizer bar too, I didn't and it shakes alot while driving.  What I did was cut a Tennis ball in half and stuck it on the elbow and tightened the whole thing down on my center console of my truck.  Won't work in most cars but in a truck with a big center console worked great.  But for the price you can't go wrong most are over 300 bucks.",3,1
"The ILO works great for awhile. Then you'll notice that the left headphone goes out.  The headphone jack wasn't installed securely.  If you're handy with a soldering iron there are instructions on the web for fixing it (not from ILO, on a user message board). <br /> <br />If you're looking for an inexpensive mp3 player with a tuner this works great.  The display is good and the design isn't too bad.  You can expand the memory to include a memory card, so it has pretty good song capacity.",3,1
"I bought this while at school due to needing a longer cord and when I found this one I was weary for sure but, once I received it I was really amazed how effective it was and how much long of a cord it was. A few days after getting it, it began to not charge my phone unless I held it a certain way then it would work fine. This lasted for another 3 weeks when finally it stopped working completely. Overall for the price and length I was content.",3,2

Ended up using a stock piece of wire from my kit. Ended up throwing wire away. Don't waste your money and time.,3,2
It's a silicon cover. That's about it. It's cut to the right size but rough around the edges and the armband is fairly flimsy. Attracts dirt and hair like a magnet.,3,2
"It was very easy to install ONLY BECAUSE I was able to go check out how to install the lines and all in KOREAN blogs.<br />If you are new to all these wiring things, might find it hard to figure out what to do.<br />Instruction included with the box is in KOREAN so you need to go to the ENGLISH version product website for guidelines.<br /><br />And there are few tips you can find by USERS not by the producer how to install the wires in car.<br /><br />By the way the adhesive to stick cameras are STRONG,<br />I have a hatch back car, I open my trunk way too often but it will never fall off or anything.<br /><br />Loving it but there are few things that can be implemented (like rare camera to be wireless... so there is no hassle)<br />and the focus seems to be little off then they claim to be HD, since I rarely can read license plates in front of me.<br />(gotta have the perfect light setting, and CLEAN front windshield)",3,1
"So far, I am very pleased with this product. It is very inexpensive therefore it is certainly not the best quality as it is made of plastic and the mounting device is plastic. Just be very careful when tightening the wing nut around the handlebars as I could easily see the mount breaking.",3,1
"was so glad that it was the right charging cable for my Nook HD+, wasn't to thrilled that the cord is very short.<br /><br />=",3,1
Camera works great and looks decent.  The problem is that the socket for the factory license plate bulb to be twisted in is too big for the bulb.  This was on a 2012 Chevy Cruze.,3,1
I would not buy it again.,3,2
"Got this for iPod touch, and loved the idea of the rotating ring.  The idea is great, but the implementation was flimsy, so the ring broke off after a month.  It is easy to fix (glue it back), but you lose rotation ability. It still can work as a stand.",3,2
"It works fine, but the product is not new (like advertised). It came in the apple shrink wrap, but I am guessing that the item is refurbished. There was a brown dirty spot on the USB end, and it looks like some one tried to cover up a scratch on the iPhone connector end with white-out. Still a good deal for an iPhone cable, but don't purchase it expecting it to be brand new.",3,1
Clips relaxed over 2 wks time such that they no longer clamp securely onto grating of air vents. It still holds the gps unit (garmin nuvi 265) but can be pulled out easily. In other words it's resting in place. This is far better than a windshield mount.,3,1
"I've had my SMARTmini for a few weeks now, and overall, it's not a bad little unit. It works well for streaming music; the sound quality is really quite good. It's probably slightly below CD-quality, but the difference is negligible. It seems to do a good job making and receiving calls, as well, with people on the other end indicating they can hear me just fine, and it's great having the person on the other end piped through the car speakers. Road noise has not been an issue while making calls. I like the flexibility of mounting options, as well, with the included stand that you can mount on the dash, or you can remove the unit from the stand and plug it directly into the AUX input (depends on where your AUX input is located).<br /><br />Here are the negative points: One - it has only a 6.5 hour battery life. I find myself charging this thing frequently, and it cannot be used while charging. It takes about 1.5 hours to fully charge. Two - it has an obnoxious, rapidly blinking blue light that flashes repeatedly while the unit is connected to your phone via bluetooth. It's not so bad during daylight hours, but I find it extremely annoying and distracting while driving at night. For these two reasons, I deducted two stars from my rating.<br /><br />All in all, it's really not bad for the price. Similar units, like the Belkin AirCast, sell for much more. But the Belkin is powered (doesn't require charging), and doesn't have the maddening blinking blue light. The Belkin also automatically turns on when you start your car, whereas the SMARTmini has to be manually turned on. The SMARTmini does, however, turn itself off automatically several minutes after the bluetooth connection is lost, so you don't have to worry about the battery draining if you forget to turn it off.",3,1
the face plate flashes and there is a delay in button reaction. it eventually catches up. problems with dimming the screen.,3,1
the case is nice but the pocket is too small to hold the cables. Plus its too small to hold da holster,3,1

"Got this about 2 months ago and it worked pretty good, then all of a sudden (after about 3 weeks) the cord didn't work (cheap cord I'm assuming). Now it doesn't work at all even though the flashlight comes on.",3,2
"the th-9800 seems to be a decent transceiver. The reason for the three stars is that the unit is a little hard to program. Instruction manual does not give very useful  directions on programong. Have also tried programong with the software and cable, but still a little difficult. Otherwise I think it will be a good first quad band for some folks.",3,1
It's ok if you want to just lay your ipod on top of the counter/around the house but I would not strap it on my arm and jog with it etc.. The cover is really loose at the bottom and my ipod just slides out of it sometimes. But like I said it's basically good if you have your ipod laying around on top of something in the house. I would have to purchase a strong durable one so my ipod will not fall out.,3,1
"The USB wall AC power adapter is not as pictured.  I wanted the flat model with prongs that fold for easy packing when traveling, but the one they send was bulbous and round and not easy to pack.  They do not carry this model.  They did give me a partial refund.",3,2

"Does exactly what it's supposed to, feels cheap but works great and it's a great price. Took a very long time to arrive in the mail though.",3,1
I don't want to say that it wasn't worth buying; two of the items are wonderful. The car charger is so easy to use and helps a lot. And the wall charger is alright too. But the retractable charger broke within three days of receiving it; hopefully this was a fluke and doesn't happen with this product often.,3,2

Cover case has a nice design.  I bought the black and it compliments my 3rd generation touch very well.  The kickstand broke the first day I owned it.  If you want to use the kickstand-I suggest another product.  If you are looking for a case only this product will do.,3,1
It wasn't what I expected but hey it works ok,3,1
"It works.....but It's not very deep front to back so does minimal shading. I'm in the habit of putting my GPS on the floor when leaving the car in a parking lot, when I do this the sun shade comes off or goes crooked..... But, as I said, it works.....minimally.",3,1
"I got a pair of these headphones with my RCA MP3 player, and they work ok. My biggest thing is that after about 30 minutes on, the way they clip to the ear, the edge of my ear feels sore, but also they irrirate just behind my ears where they rest, so they get uncomfortable. So, they are ok, but they do have other models available of hear bud size headphones that clip into the ear that are more comfortable on my ears. you just have to try them if you can before you buy them. <br />",3,1
"Although I wasn't happy with the results of trying to install the screen protector, I just wanted to thank the manufacturer for issuing an immediate, hassle-free refund.

"Bought one for my wife a month ago and was impressed with the sound and bought one for myself but noticed that mine had a vibration sound on some songs that had a little extra bass to them (rock and blues type songs, not rap or hip hop).  Thought I may have received a bad unit so returned it and ordered a replacement, got the new one and had the same problem.  Emailed the company inquiring the issue and basically was told that the vibrating was a natural phenomenon and I should expect some vibrating and also recommend that I play it on a flat surface, which I also do.  So I am returning the unit and bought the Sharkk boombox instead, received today and am very pleased with the sound of this one.",3,1
"What they don't tell you here is that you will need an additional \\""30 pin to lightening port\\"" adaptor to make this work with anything that has the newest \\""lightening\\"" connection. Please consider this as you decide if you want to order it or not. My husband bought me a new ipod and wanted me to be able to play it in my car. He bought this adaptor under the assumption that it would work with ALL ipods (as is says it does) and it won't work on my newer one. If you have the lightening, and you order this go ahead and order the adaptor so you can at least use yours when you get it instead of having to now wait longer like I am now.",3,2
"The quality is good. But it will not adjust to fit small arms, it just keeps sliding down my arm. Not the best choice for girls with small arms.",3,1
I really like the jambox but sometimes it want connect to my cell phone and the speaker doesn't work that loud as expected but other then that I like it,3,1
"For the price, the clip-Dat Mini clip MP3 player provides good sound, easy pick up from the song you left off on, and convenience of portability. The biggest issue I have had with this product is that when inserting the headphones, or pressing the fast forward/rewind buttons, the pressure causes the micro SD card to pop up/out and has to be reinserted. The product I purchased did not come with the USB-HSD cord, luckily I had a spare one to attach to it. The player does not work or even read without the micro SD card,and  because there were no instructions, I found this out through trial and error. A plus is that this device can support up to a 8GB micro SD card so I can have a large selection of music at my fingertips.",3,2
"It works, but it is very slow to charge. I use this to charge a phone or two at a time, but when I charge two phones it is really slow.",3,2
"I purchased this case because its the first purple iPhone 4 case I was able to find.  I purchased it fully intending to replace it with something a bit nicer as the market catches up with technology.      Though this fits the phone, it isn't completely snug, and one can easily slip part of it off accidentally or debris can get caught in between the phone and the case.  All the buttons are totally accessible, but the bottom line is that this case is simply not sexy enough for a device like the iPhone 4.      I have since replaced this case with the free bumper sent to me by Apple (sadly in black).  I'm still on the lookout for that perfect purple iPhone 4 case...",3,1
"This product came quickly and was everything I expected.  The sound quality is not perfect, but is is not horrible. It really depends on the area you are in and what kind of reception you get.  Good quality for the price paid.  I use it everyday and would buy it again.",3,1
"I bought this armband because the cutout for the click wheel allows you to have direct contact with the click wheel.  I've used other armbands where there's a plastic screen over the click wheel which makes it very difficult to navigate. However, when I got this armband no matter how much I tried to cram my iPod down into the sleeve that holds it, the click wheel wouldn't line up with the circular cut out....very disappointing!  I can still manage to use the click wheel but it takes a little effort.  Other than that, it has solid construction, has a long strap for various sized arms and is very light.",3,2
Automatic  sensor it not working  correctly,3,1
I like the boom box a lot.  I bought the head phones also but they do not work on the boombox.  I thought they would work and did not see anything saying they would not work.  I thought it would be a good idea to have ear phones for the cd since it is good to have quiet time.  Now I have headphones and nothing to use them on.  Next time I guess I will have to ask questions.,3,2
"I purchased the SG4 temp. cart mount because I was having trouble keeping satellite signals synchronized on my SG4.  Actually, I didn't notice any improvement in the SG4 performance, but the mount proved handy.  One year after purchase, one of the ears on the \\""yoke clamp\\"" (the connection that one tightens with the wing-nut to position the skycaddie) broke off making the mount useless.  This socket scheme seems to be a very weak link to an otherwise useful product.  The part appears to be a thermo-set molded piece, costing a few cents to fabricate.  I contacted customer service by phone thinking they would simply send a replacement piece...probably free for customer relations purposes.  I was told I could purchase a replacement yoke clamp for $19.95 plus $11.00 for ground shipping.   Mind you, a new mount runs about $50.  I think I'll try baling wire.",3,2
"The book reader is a good reader, with a very immature, boring voice.  It would be nice to hear some style, and feeling in his voice.  As for the musical selections - pieces and composers - boring!

"All claims made in advertisements for 5 different battery backups for iPhones, which I have bought and used, exaggerate how many charges of the iPhone they can make.    This one is no different. To charge from empty, one can get one full charge and about 20% more. This is about the same as the batteries with 1900mAh.     It takes about 1 1/2 hours to fully charge from empty.    This \\""True Power\\"" battery encases the iPhone very nicely and is very convenient when continuing to use the iPhone whilst it is charging.    This battery should be about $60 based on value and convenience for money. I think the best for the money spent is the \\""Angry Bird\\"" battery.     My wife has not told me to send it back, so it is worth having.     One of the other 5 that I bought was cheap and useless, and my wife told me to return the solar-charging battery.

"I purchased this antenna for my Harley (Touring).  The antenna does work but it's not quite as good as a regular antenna.  For my circumstance it does the job good enough.  I'll say this much, you get what you pay for.  Before  deciding where I wanted to place it inside the fairing I plugged it in to see how well it worked in different spots. Once I made my decision where to install it I unplugged it and the wire pulled apart from the plug. This is the main reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 4. The only good thing about it pulling apart is that it made it really easy for me to decide to shorten the length of the cable to 2' instead of keeping the entire length tucked into the fairing.<br /><br />On another note, after this thing fell apart, I went online and found another antenna similar to this one on eBay for $19 and it had a longer element length (17&#34; instead of 13&#34;). If I had to do it again I would probably go with the longer one.",3,2
Headphones are okay for the price. However the magnets in the ear buds are fair strong I've noticed them sticking to the iPad and other metal surfaces. Also the white bit under the ear bud just comes straight down does hold at all. If you are going to get these don't expect them to last long.,3,1
"I brought this as part of a home karoke system. It sounds really good, however there was one hand held and one lavalier mic. Not a big problem and I actually like it a little better that way. Not what I expected, but I still like. Great sound for the money.",3,1

"The case is Ok, but it tends to result in accidentally clicking the wrong button, thus skipping tracks and calling up menus, and so on.  Also, the suede on the inside seems to be staining the back of the player black.",3,1
Not too much to say about these. I've ordered them a few times now. About 25% of them work for a few weeks then die. The others seem to hold out for awhile. I guess you get what you pay for. Amazon has been great about replacing them when they die so I guess no worries there.,3,2
"Serviceable, but very fragile for a phone holster - it broke within two days, as it is primarily plastic. Luckily, I salvaged parts from the old one (also broken) to fix it. In the future, when this one breaks again, I will just carry the phone in my pocket.",3,2
"Good price, however, the headphones that came with it didn't work very well.  I have only listened to music on it.  I could only get the battery to charge if I had the switch switched to on.",3,1
It quit working after I tried it for the second time :(,3,2
"I will give a very brief review on this Veho Pebble 2200mAh Smartstick. I have had this product for about 1 year now so I feel like I have gotten a very good idea of what it has to offer.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Very portable<br />- Doesn't heat up too much<br />- Multiple connectors for different devices<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Takes a really long time to recharge<br />- Takes a really long time to charge your device compared to other portable battery packs<br />- Only red/blue LED power status indicator<br />- Because of multiple connectors, the connection isn't very tight<br />- 2200 mAh means I can usually only charge my phone once before I have to charge the batter pack again<br /><br />Overall, this is an okay device. After you unbox this item you will find:<br /><br />- 1 Pebble Smartstick<br />- 1 USB charging cable<br />- 5 device charging tips (30 pin iPhone tip, Sony Ericsson, Nokia pin tip, mini USB and micro USB)<br />- 1 Carry pouch<br />- 1 User manual<br /><br />After taking it out of the box, the first thing I always do with portable chargers is make sure I charge them so that they are 100% and ready to go. Out of the box, this took about 3 1/2 hours to charge the entire thing. This is quite a long time to charge something that has much less capacity than many of its competitors. After I charged it, I plugged it into my Samsung Galaxy S4. It took more than 4 hours to completely charge the device (with 0 use during this time). This is substantially longer than my other portable chargers where I can get a full charge while using the device in about 3 hours.<br /><br />One annoying thing about this product is that because there are so many connectors, it has one generic one that plugs into all of them. So the connection isn't as sturdy as just a normal 2 sided cable. Also, because I use the micro-USB one the most I find that the end of the cable right by the connection is very thick. It cannot fit into the cutout that my phone case has, so I have to remove the case before I want to charge it. This is a little annoying. So, I basically use the micro-USB cable that came with my phone. The problem with that is that it is so long, that it's a pain to carry that in my pocket. So that is one huge drawback of this product.<br /><br />Another drawback is the LED power status indicator light. It is only red and blue. So even though you've been charging the product for an hour it will still be red but you don't know if it's 30% charged or 60% charged or even 80% charged. One thing I would change is give maybe a blinking status or even have multiple little LED dots to give the battery status.<br /><br />Overall, this is an okay product, but now that there are so many other kinds of portable chargers which much higher capacities, I would probably stay away from this one. It does it's job, but it does so very insufficiently. I have portable chargers which have 3 times the capacity that this one does, yet it charges faster and it charges the devices I plug it into faster. The one thin that this does have over all my other ones is the portability. It is very slim and not too heavy, so carrying it around the pocket is no big deal.<br /><br />If you are in the market for a portable charger, I think that you will be able to find other ones at a similar price which give better performance. If you have any questions about this product, feel free to message me and I would be more than happy to help out.",3,1
"If your like have extra cord for your zune, this will work. The cord and wires are good. The cases are nice as well. My belt clip on the case comes undone some time. (A dab of glue would fix). I love the little speaker,but mine won't hold a charged. Worked great first week.",3,1

"Couldn't decide between this and the FlexSMART for my car, which lacks an aux-in port. Eventually went with the SMARTmini, based on the superb reviews and its portability. However, I regretted my decision just 3 days later. The DC barrel, while sturdy, is too long that it comes extremely close to my transmission stick. Its lack of a flexible neck left me only two ways to bypass this issue - turn it to the left or turn it to the right, both inconvenient. No power button and the sound quality through aux-in could also have been better. Good construction though.<br /><br />Didn't test out the Bluetooth calling, as everything else wasn't cutting it for me.<br /><br />Now that I have the FlexSMART, I can confidently say that I like it much better.",3,1
"No real complaints , works ok , shipping was slow as hell",3,1

"This product is a great case, but the tab doesn't fit 100% securely. The 360° swivel is excellent and helps for a quick jump between portrait and landscape viewing. Although a lock for portrait and landscape angles would make it even better.",3,1
"It's too bad really. I actually like the flexible, rubbery texture of this case. I like that it covers the volume and power buttons, but is thinner material so still accessible. However, it wasn't until I put it on my iTouch that there were 3 major flaws or imperfections - what appears to be 3 white squares. I don't know what they are really. You can't see them without the iTouch on, but it's as if this was a used product to begin with. It's still usable, but I wouldn't order again from this merchant.",3,2
This item protects my player very well.  It provides great access to all areas of the device without obstruction.  The only negative is its screen protector.  It creates glare and and has a small imperfection on it that distorts the screen image.,3,1
"The item that shows on the package is not exactly the same as the one that I got, but it works fine.",3,1
I bought this for my dad along with a cheap mp3 player because he wanted to be able to listen to music in his work truck.  When we got it we found out we needed to get a male to male 3.5mm cord to connect the mp3 player to the transmitter.  When we went to plug the mp3 player into the transmitter it had a bad connection on the transmitter end.  The USB port seems to work fine though so for as cheap as it is it isn't that big of a problem.,3,1

"fit perfectly, child loved it. The smell of it was crazy bad. smelled like body sweat. We washed it in dishsoap and left it outside for about a week and the smell lessened. eventually it went away. seller offered to give a discount or buy it back. Said it was the way they are manufactured. If you buy from this seller, know that you need time to let it air out before giving it as a gift.",3,1
"PROS:  - Can play music from the AM/FM radio, CDs, MP3 CDs, SD cards, flash drives (USB) or other MP3 players via line-in (AUX) port  - Tracks can be set to play in random order while both tracks and albums can be set to play repeatedly  - Up to 99 tracks can be arranged in a playlist (called \\""Program List\\"" in the boombox's manual) and played accordingly. However identifying the tracks that you want in your playlist can be a problem (see second-last con)  - Portable and fairly light  CONS:  - When playing music from SD cards or flash drives the last few seconds of a track do not play. This is most annoying when the track ends within 2 or 3 seconds after the music's end. The music then sounds as if someone had pulled the plug a few seconds before the performers actually finished.  - Searching for tracks is quite crude as it's limited either to skipping backward or forward one track at a time or only forward ten tracks at a time per press of the button (no searching by album/folder is possible). This means that searching for a track in a list of a few hundred MP3 files can be a pain (moving to the 201th file would require the user to press the button at least 20 times)  - No remote control included but this seems to depend on the batch produced as some apparently do come with remote control  - No bass boost or adjustable EQ  - Tag information for MP3 files not displayed; information is limited to the file being assigned a number  - Default order of music as played from SD card or USB follows the order in which the albums or tracks were loaded or edited on the flash drive/SD card. Therefore if you want your music to play with albums arranged alphabetically then you need to load the album that starts with \\""A\\"" before \\""B\\"" and so on. This is the only way to create some semblance of order since the player doesn't recognize or display MP3 tags (see previous con).  I bought this player because of its ability to play SD cards and flash drives and as a second stereo in the kitchen as an alternative to my existing mini stereo in my room which can play music on USB drives. I didn't care much about the other features since much less expensive boomboxes play CDs, offer a radio and often a line-in port as a matter of course.  Unfortunately boomboxes or mini shelf stereos that can read files via USB or SD cards are badly outnumbered by otherwise similar players with docks for iPods thanks to Apple's insistence on non-standard peripherals and cables for iPods and the subsequent creation of the mass of users/fanboys/fangirls who have hitched themselves to Apple's propietary technology. Some DVD players and high-end stereos can read music from SD cards and/or flash drives but those are overkill (and too expensive) for my purposes and as mentioned earlier I already got one of the few mini stereos that can read music via USB before stereos with iPod docks came to crowd out the competition.  To minimize the hassle in searching for tracks yet have enough music so that I don't keep switching cards every day, I've been using a SD card at 2GB capacity or about 400 tracks in my case. I prefer playing the stereos when at home (despite the problems with this boombox) while using my MP3 player when out and about. Unfortunately, I have to put up with many tracks having their music cut off at the end (unless the track contains several seconds of silence after the music's conclusion) because of a manufacturing defect.  The bottom line is that if you can put up with the quirks then this boombox should be OK as a spare or secondary one. Otherwise you'd either need to cave in to Apple in order to use the many stereos that have iPod docks or pay a lot more money for a stereo that can play music from formats that have been actually industry standard and not part of a monopoly (i.e. SD cards and USB).",3,2
"It does what it is supposed to do, and it's much cheaper than the OEM version. Unfortunately, the end that connects into the iPod or iPhone is the old style where you still have to push two things in to remove it, and after a while, it stopped working and would not stay put in the iPod or iPhone. I guess be careful when connecting or disconnecting it. Also, make sure you push the end that connects into your Hyundai ALL THE WAY IN or the sound won't work.",3,2
"The cable quality seems fine, but it does not fit all cases.",3,1
"It works ok for a case but it blocks the on/off button at the top and I continually have to peel back the case top to turn the screen on and off.  However, the case itself works fine.",3,1
"I like this little case, but it breaks easily.  However, at this price it's easy to replace.  I'm ordering another one today.",3,1
"It makes a clicking sound in my car's stereo, but not my wife's. I think the stereo is trying to change sides and it was very annoying at first, but it fades into the background if the volume is up. I may buy another one (different brand) and let my wife use this one.",3,2
"This is a nice envelope, typical of what we would expect from Timbuk2.  I have been using their products for years and they are great. They last forever! However, I was hoping my ipad mini would fit in this envelope and it doesn't...so my quest for an adequate ipad mini sleeve resumes....",3,1
These are ok they do cover the phone well but look almost cartoonish...just not what I expected detail wise. However my kid likes them.,3,1
"I purchased the Gomadic transmitter/charger for my new Sansa clip.  I only listen to my mp3 player in the car, so I needed something that would transmit the music.  My previous Sansa had a transmitter/charger was made directly by Sansa and was able to charge and transmit at the same time.  However, the Gomadic transmitter/charger can only do one or the other at a time.  If I want to play music, I cannot have the charger part plugged in.  I am a little disappointed with the product since my last one was able to both simultaneously.  Regardless, the Gomadic still allows me to listen to mp3 player in the car.  I just hope the battery on the Sansa lasts a while.",3,1
"The next 8-pin should be lower because I remove the protective cover in order to carry the phone, probably everyone who uses covers vain to have to take to connect the charger.",3,1
Cuts in and out a lot. Works pretty well other than that,3,1
Included this as a present for my sis's new Zen Mp3 and the product is not only providing protection but also creating an eye catching effect!,3,1
Good back up and spare cords.  One cannot have too many.  We have one in most rooms and in our gear bags too.,3,1
"I purchased this Bluetooth adapter to connect to an installed IDA-X305 Alpine stereo.  After making all of my connections, I could not \\""pair\\"" my cell phone with the adapter.  I checked all of my electrical connections and tried to pair it once again - no luck.  I re-read the entire instruction booklet and tried various suggestions listed by other reviewers, but nothing worked.  Finally, I read a reviewers note to connect the pink and black wires together with the head unit, and sure enough, it worked.  I was able to \\""pair\\"" very easily.  The unit works well but the instruction booklet is very poorly written and lacks some very important information.  The instructions say that the pink and black wires do not need to be connected when the Alpine KWE-460E Adapter cable is used - this was not the case with my stereo.  The instructions do not tell you how to update the firmware either.",3,2
"Bought this product knowing it was cheap and knew I wouldn't get much for my money. It records alright, but the initial &#34;turning on the camera&#34; was a pain in the a**. I pressed the power button and it turned on right away, but it was in a foreign language. It took me probably a good 10-15 minutes to switch to English. Other than that, it's just an ok product, It sort of has a mind of it's own.<br /><br />The camera will turn on &#34;sometimes&#34; with the key turning, but never shuts off by itself. It does however periodically stop recording on its on, but only sometimes.... This is also a pain, but what do you expect out of a cheap camera...?",3,2
The case fits the Ipod Touch 5g perfect but after a month of use the gems are starting to fall off.,3,1
"I told it was really great at first. But recently I've noticed that it doesn't seem to fully charge. I thought at first that maybe I just wasn't letting it charge long enough, so I let it charge all night long and the next day the light was green so I thought it was full. Later that night, my phone(iPhone 5) was dying so I plugged it into this external charger. I got it from 10% to 20% and it ran out of juice. From what I have read of the other reviews, this does not seem very right.<br /><br />Other than that, I have to say that it looks fantastic and has a nice feel to it. The flashlight is also one of the brightest I have ever seen.",3,1
The glare guard works great but have found it a little difficult to remove the air bubbles.  Might try something else next time.,3,2
This item works well but I feel it could be improved.  The sound quality could be better. I purchased this unit to replace one I purchased at Radio Shack.  The ear protection is excellent in view of the fact I have a hearing problem it does a great job. That is probably why I have some problems understanding.  The other issue that would improve this unit would be ability to pre-set radio stations or at least some way to find stations. You sort of have to fish for them.,3,1
"Case was perfect, Garmin 2597 fit like it should but the included screen protectors were about quarter inch to small and the Garmin touch screen did not work with the protector on so I just removed it.",3,1

"As a buyer of well-over 300 Baofeng radios (and counting) for the group I belong to (not all of which were purchased through Amazon but many were), I'm always amazed at the lengths some sellers go to to hype their products as being \\""newer\\"" or \\""better\\"" than other models, or perhaps (to give them the benefit of the doubt) they just don't know any better.<br /><br />First, the Baofeng UV-5R series (including the original and still extremely popular UV-5R, I'll explain why in a minute) is what is normally referred to by many as a SDR radio (or software defined radio).  While not a true SDR product (you can't use it with your computer to control the radio's functions or scan a wide amount of VHF/UHF frequencies with it), none the less a large chip is programmed on the circuit board built inside each radio.  That chip determines what capability the radio itself can perform.<br /><br />Every UV-5R series radio has the ability to transmit from 136-174 MHz on VHF and from 400-520 MHz on UHF in both narrow-band and wide-band modes (very useful for the occasional FRS or MURS use, which requires narrow-band mode to work correctly).<br /><br />Every model does \\""at least\\"" 4W on VHF/UHF from the factory, but occasionally you'll get a batch that does 4.5W or even 5W out, but the difference between 4W and 5W is minimal at best.  A 4W radio with a better antenna will easily outperform a 5W radio with the standard crappy antenna that Baofeng ships on ALL (including the UV-5RA, -5RAX, and -5RAX+) models.<br /><br />Baofeng DOES NOT program those chips any differently for the UV-5R vs. any other UV-5R series (including the UV-5RA).  Version 307 of the firmware (which is the most current release I have in any of my radios) works EXACTLY the same way as previous older releases of firmware at least back to the 295 release (over a year ago), so any claim from a seller that this release provides additional features (at least from a user's perspective) is simply BOGUS, since the firmware inside both radios have the same features.  In fact, my UV-5R radios with the 307 firmware release is EXACTLY the same radio (inside and within the firmware) as my UV-5RA radios with the 307 firmware release.<br /><br />Second, you CANNOT in any way upgrade the firmware (unless you count buying a different radio and it comes with a different firmware release), so again the claim in the listing from some sellers that you can is simply BOGUS.<br /><br />Third, you can believe that two thinner pieces (glued or screwed together on the faceplate of the UV-5RA) is somehow stronger than one thicker piece of plastic (on the original UV-5R series) if you like (and maybe it is), but I haven't seen that in real-world use from my own UV-5RA units.  The standard UV-5R units that we use seem to hold up just as well (when dropped in the desert dirt or rolling down a hill) as any other Baofeng radio we own and use.<br /><br />Fourth, and my biggest issue with all of the non-standard UV-5RA, UV-5RAX and UV-5RAX+ units, is that NONE of the Baofeng battery accessories (except the little 1800 mAh standard battery) work WITHOUT modification (unless you use a Dremel tool to grind or cut off part of your extended battery that works on the standard UV-5R - but won't work on your UV-5RA, UV-5RAX or UV-5RAX+).<br /><br />Getting new UV-5RA units that don't work with Extended 3800 mAh batteries (without modification) doesn't make my group happy.  That may not bother you, but NONE of the sellers of the non-standard UV-5RA, UV-5RAX, and UV-5RAX+ units ever seem to mention that lack of hardware compatibility in their listings, so buyer beware!<br /><br />BTW, NONE of the \\""AA\\"" or \\""AAA\\"" battery shell packs work on the UV-5RA, UV-5RAX, or UV-5RAX+ units either, so that's 3 different battery accessories (including the 3800 mAh extended battery) that you can't use on these radios without hacking them with a Dremel tool (but they all work without modification on the original UV-5R units).<br /><br />So \\""if\\"" you want a \\""pretty\\"" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (or -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.  Oh, you should see how well that shiny faceplate lights up when a flashlight hits it in the dark, just the thing you don't want for night use.<br /><br />Virtually every guy in our group ends up carrying a standard UV-5R and giving the UV-5RA, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ to the wife or kids, since the wife and/or kids rarely care about the other accessories working and they (the wife and kids) tend to like the \\""pretty\\"" radios, but again there is NO INTERNAL difference and NO EXTRA FEATURES in the UV-5RA, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ units (other than a different looking shiny faceplate) vs. the original and still wildly popular UV-5R (which I refer to as the M16 of radios, as all the accessories you match it up with just plain work).<br /><br />Now you know the real background on these radios.f\\"" you want a \\""pretty\\"" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (or -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.

I got these cases...they are nice but they are a little snug on my ipod touch 3G. The screen protector is a little bit litter than the screen but they are of good quality...,3,1
"I'm probably returning this.  At first it seemed to work as advertised, however after a while I noticed that songs were sounding like they were \\""skipping\\"" just briefly every couple seconds.  It became really distracting - the whole tempo of a song would be messed up just briefly for you to notice it.  Perhaps it's just my phone (nearly new HTC One M8), but I've not had issue with other bluetooth audio devices.<br /><br />Switched back to a cable and the \\""skipping\\"" effect stopped.  I'm guessing this is just a cheap receiver.  It might work for our other car, I'll have to test.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say find another product.<br /><br />Edit:  I did notice that the \\""skipping\\"" effect seems to only happen when the product is on battery.  When it's plugged into a 5V USB source, it streams perfectly.  This is fine for me 90% of the time since I leave it plugged in and tucked into the arm rest of my car.  Since there's a workaround, I'm changing the rating to 3 stars.<br /><br />Edit2:  Manufacturer contacted me to try out another unit.  I'm happy to oblige since perhaps the one I received acts oddly.  I'll update with the results!",3,2
"Can not give a true review on this, have not used their service as yet.  Hope i do not have to!",3,2

"Purchase of this clock was to wake a deaf person when no one was home to do just that and it has done just that, as of right now there are no problems, BUT, this clock is so poorly made, the plastic is very thin, you don't dare knock it on the floor, it would nor survive, and the LED bars that it uses, well even set at their brightest, they don't look \\""solid\\"", they waver, some bars are much dimmer then others, my fear is that they will soon go out, I wish West Clock still made alarm clocks for the deaf, my mother had one for many years, when she died, we were moving her belongings and it was stolen.",3,2
"It was okay,",3,1
"The case looks good, and seems like it will be pretty protective. Unfortunately it needs to be protective since it is very slippery to hold.  Definitely more style than substance.",3,1
"Overall this case isn't so bad, but with a few modifications it could even be better.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1 - Case snaps closed and is magnetic, which is nice so it doesn't flap open when it's in my purse.<br /><br />2 - The decal applies really easy and is very pretty.<br /><br />3 - The screen protector applied easily and I had a few bubbles but since it came with a little card that made it easy to get the bubbles out.  Actually removing the bubbles was easier when I was outside waiting for the bus as it was cooler outside than it was in my apartment.<br /><br />4 - The case is sturdy and protects very well.<br /><br />5 - Able to charge the Nook Tablet while it's in the case which is a plus!<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1 - When you put the Nook Tablet in the case the elastic enclosures on the top cover the power button on the left side and the volume buttons on the right.  I have to leave it off on the left side because it kept turning my Nook Tablet on and off and my battery would die in less than a day.  I thought something was wrong with my Nook Tablet until my husband thought of the idea of not using that top elastic to hold my Nook in.  Even not using that top left elastic my Nook does stay in the case tightly without a problem, so there is a work around.  Not ideal but it works.  As for the elastic on the right side, I just deal, it's not so bad. Most of the time I have the volume off anyway and I can still reach around the elastic to use the volume controls.<br /><br />2 - This one is just personal preference no big deal the pockets on the inside of the case are stiff and small.  You can't really use them for anything more than a credit/debit card or bus pass.",3,1
"Good gadget, but not what I expected.  It serves it's purpose which is mainly to play music and store data. I bought three but would not buy again or recommend. However the person that I bought it for, my husband, loves it!",3,1
"Works really well, but you have to be consistent with scanning your finger print.  I never had any problems using it, however other family members struggled with getting it to work consistently, due to lack of scanning their prints consistently.  I ended up switching it out for a numeric keypad to make everyone happy.",3,1
"user guide said it was not needed or recommended, there fore I did not try it on the galaxy note",3,2
The case is nice. Finishing is not so good. Have a thin white scratch outside the black covert. Other than than quality of the case is very good.,3,1
"This product is just what it appears to be, and while it works well, it does not stand out from its peers in any particular way. Direct adapters such as this typically provide a much higher quality of sound than FM transmission devices, but do not think you will avoid static entirely, as dirt and dust will collect on the tape heads.<br />One thing I wish I had considered before purchasing it is the color, very few vehicles have a white tape deck, so the cord leading from the tape deck is quite obvious, and you may wish to pop this out and put it in your glove compartment if you live in an area where theft is a problem (as people will assume the device to which it connects may also be in the car).<br />Aside from that caveat, this is a good item which has served me well since I purchased it on Amazon over a year ago.",3,1
"The product arrived in very bad conditions, because the package was not the appropriate. Nothing more to comment",3,2
Can't use ear plugs with it,3,2
"I loved this little pink bear  when I saw it online.  It is good protection for your ipod if you drop it.  However, the skin is a bit thick so it is a little tough to work the controls on the outer edge of the ipod, and it takes some practice to plug in your charger.  But, if cute is what you want, cute is what you'll get.",3,1
"It could have been the fact I was using a sealed box and not a ported, but this sub sounded rather weak to me.  sound quality is all a matter of preference and I like deeper, more boomy bass.

I was disappointed in the fact that Amazon did not mention in the description that this is not an Original Music Angel, but for the price it is a decent product.",3,2
"I like this case. I would have liked it better if the material was more substantial and if I didn't have to slide it off to use my iPod USB cable. It won't work unless I do this because it doesn't fit flush against the iPod. However, it's perfect for when I walk and use my iPod as a pedometer.",3,1

this is a nice amp to have for your system...i give it a three because after two weeks it burned out...glad it was under warranty,3,1
Worked but not under load.  If your load is very low then it should work but for my application this was not the case and I sent it back.  Easy to set up and I was hopeful but could not get it to maintain the desired output voltage as it dropped by 25% under load.,3,2
"I know it was inexpensive & actually quite well made.  Well made in an upside down position.  It's really fine, just when you open it you have to turn it backwards.",3,1

Hides well but really does not improve the reception over a piece of wire that much.,3,1
"good value, simple but has done the job to protect my nook. fast shipping, i would recommend it as an economical cover",3,1
"I just got my case and it was okay. It does what it needs to do, protect the Nook. It also comes with a stylus that works, which is a bonus. Although there isn't a place to store the stylus in the case. The pocket works but is tight, so nothing thick like the stylus. The strap that goes around the case has a indented place to go, but it is a little hard to get out. The color is just how it looks in the picture. I tried dropping the case on hardwood floor and everything stayed in place. I suggest this case to people who don't exactly care about what the case looks like, but for people who  just need it to do it's job. It is great case for kids too.",3,1
not exactly what i expected - smaller than i wanted / not enough room for accessories.,3,1
"Update: spring clip broke after 8 months of daily use. A tiny plastic loop that held it on broke, not repairable. Not a huge deal as the price is low and it worked well for that time, just hate throwing out another useless piece of plastic.<br /><br />Tried this clip after being disappointed with another case for nano. The clip works pretty well, I can clip to a shirt or pocket and its reasonably secure. Not quite as strong a clip as the old square nanos had built in, but I think that's because the new nano is much bigger.<br /><br />The odd thing is that the case actually covers the buttons of the nano, which at first made it harder to push the power and volume buttons. After a very short break in period (a day or two) I found that the buttons worked just fine, and I like how the case turns the new pause button from an innie to an outie, so to speak.<br /><br />The only drawback for me is the fit around the screen is not perfect, because the front of the case is a semi stretchy rubber, I think to allow you to insert the device. It holds securely, just doesn't look absolutely sharp. But I prefer function over looks so I can live with that.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this to someone looking for a clip case for nano, as there currently aren't many to choose from. I just wish it came in colors!",3,2
Sold it.....wasn't what I needed,3,1
"It looks nice. Says its Bluetooth ready, but it isn't. It also says it's compatible with android or iPhone, but only if you buy the model 2400 or higher. It was supposed to play Pandora from my phone but neglected to state that only works with iPhone. I would have purchased a different brand for cheaper if I just wanted basic non existent features.",3,1
For the price i got it and was expecting it would not work. It worked but the FM Channels are on channels where its being interfered with. The only technichal problem i ran into it was a power supply problem. It requires a car plug in AND Batterys in order to operate<br />But other wise a good product for the price.,3,1
This is a great idea and a great price but the quality is lacking. I ordered three of these and two work great and one is broke. Its a very weak design but what do you expect for the price.,3,1
"I was a little bummed that it did not the the home button, it does say on the description but it is still a downer",3,2

"I bought this to power two GPS units in my vehicle (a Tom Tom GO 730 I use for navigation and a Garmin Nuvi 350 I use for APRS.) The good news is that this charger can power both units. The bad news is that it does not sit well in the cigarette lighter, and often disconnects for no apparent reason.    I find the blue light a little annoying, but at least it makes it easier to see when the unit disconnects.",3,1
"The car charger worked great, but the FM transmitter didn't work at all. Debating on whether I should return this or not.",3,2
It does not stay,3,2
"I received the products in a US Postal Service box.  The items worked fine out of the box but looked increadibly cheap and light.  Unfortunately, the Wall Charger didn't last long, lasting all of 5 minutes.  I noticed some kind of spark and it died.  Am just glad that my Zen Vision M wasn't damaged out of it.   <br /> <br />As for the car charger, it still works.  The A/V cable is the only thing I'm really happy about with the package.  It seems sturdy with thick cables.   <br /> <br />I would recommend the A/V cable and probably the car charger but not the wall charger.",3,1
"It's a nice case, just received it A LOT later than I thought.... I was disappointed. But looks good. I just received it, so haven't looked at it too good.",3,2
Products were all received as described. All good quality and sharp looking for the iTouch.,3,1
"Last Saturday I bought one and after a couple of days the built-in speaker broke down. So I brought it back, my new one didn't work at all didn't recharge or anything so I brought it back and the latest that I have works but there was no battery in the box. But after reading other reviews I saw that there were not reallt problems with broken PMC's so probably the store sold used player because the boxes were not new and already opened. But in the time it worked I enjoyed it and I like it very much.",3,2
Not as sturdy as I thought.,3,1
The product was shipped very promptly and the instructions were easy enough to follow.  The quality of the modulator leaves a lot to be desired though.  Spend more money for a better product.,3,1
"**EDIT<br /><br />Afterthought - I checked the terminals and according to Knuconceptz response they were correct. The marking for positive and negative seem to be on the plastic housing which doesn't seem to stay on too well or got swapped during the install proces as they kept coming unclipped from the terminals. I would order another positive terminal to replace my broken one - disregard my original review below.<br /><br />I bought these a few months back - finally got around to installing them.. the connections to the actual terminals to your car/devices is great I love that feature of them.. super easy and solid connection. However, these supposedly tapered terminals won't stay on my battery posts.. One would simply NOT fit on the battery post and the metal snapped in the process. The other terminal was far too loose on the terminal and I had to put TIN FOIL in there to fill the gap because lead battery shim posts were too big and for some reason these don't fit on standard size battery terminals correctly without slipping off. I took the set screws ALL the way out and still had no luck getting these secured on the battery posts. Surprised the metal snapped on one it was a clean break like it was machined improperly. Knuconceptz makes great wires but these battery terminals are faulted in a big way.",3,1
Good for the price.. cord works ok but the wall adapter almost caught fire! Need to return the wall adapter.. it made the phone switch from screen to screen when in use.. so i will be returning it.,3,2
Looks cool! However I modded it. I cut wires to those dorky headlights flashing LEDs. The sound doesn't always stay on the same level using line-in.,3,1
"12/25/13<br />This system was delivered on time and well packaged. I have it hooked to my ps3 mainly for movies. I hooked it up last night and enjoyed watching Netflix. Played with the remote, set my FM stations. I don't like the retractable metal antenna, I would have preferred a wired one. The antenna is mounted on the back of the sub woofer with 2 screws so I imagine it can be replaced.<br /><br />The sound is okay, the bass is a little better when using the radio. I haven't tried the USB yet but so far the one SD card I have does't work. I shut it off with the remote last night when I tried to turn it on with the remote this morning it did not work. I am hoping I may have gotten a bad battery which is easy to replace. Chances are I will not use the SD/USB, I bought it mainly for the remote, but I would like to get what I paid for. I will get a new battery for the remote, if that doesn't work I will be forced to RMA it. If everything had worked I would have given it five stars.",3,1
"I got this for my sister as a Christmas gift.  It looks great and shipped fast.  However, when we went to put the face cover on, the top doesn't snap on all the way and so when it is pushed it makes a clicking sound.  She decided to keep it though, but if you are concerned about the fit, I wouldn't recommend it.",3,1
"I received this product on the exact date the shipper said I'd get it. I believe it arrived inside 7 days. I was quite pleased with that.    Overall I think I spent about 15 minutes reading the instructions and figuring out the remote control. It has nice features that you can change depending on the music you like (Jazz, rock, rop, classical, etc). You can also alter the bass and treble as well. The sound is outstanding for the price! I normally keep the volume around 5-7 as I have a small studio to fill the music with. I did turn it up to much higher and never heard the crackle that some inexpensive system deliver.    The downside: The CD player is great if you play store bought CD's. I have several burned CD's and it doesn't read them very well. This was very disappointing as that is one of the main reasons I bought a new stereo/CD player. I'm hoping that it's just the last batch of CD's I purchased and not the stereo. The other downside, you cannot work the CD player without the remote, or at least I have not figured that out yet.    I have not experimented with the MP3 attachment yet.     For the price, it's a decent little player. If you're looking for using it more with CD's you might want to hunt around more.",3,1
Doesn't quite fit.  Difficult to get to the upper buttons,3,2
THIS IS COOL FOR AN IPOD BUT THE ADAPTER THAT CONNECTS TO THE IPOD ITSELF  KEEPS FALLING OUT OF THE BOTTOM OF MY IPOD AND ALL MY CHARGERS CONNECT JUST FINE SO WHATS THE DEAL? MAYBE I GOT A BAD ONE WHO KNOWS?,3,1
"It's adjustable to fit any size cup holder, but I have a Honda and the cup holders have a thin piece of rubber that aides in holding bottles snug etc. but get in the way of a tight fit with this item.",3,1
"This product was easy to set up and reasonably inexpensive.  I had it use the FM transmitter, and testing with the car parked in my driveway it worked fine if I turned up the volume on both the device and my radio.  However, I have a noisy car and even with the device's volume set to the maximum value, the sound of the incoming call was too soft to be usable.  You can increase the volume on your radio, but the volume coming out of the speaker is a lot softer than playing an FM radio station.  I would have liked to have tried the option of connecting the cable from the device to the radio, but my radio does not have an \\""aux\\"" input.  Another thing to be aware of is that if you have a manual transmition and your \\""cigarette lighter\\"" is close to the stick, you can knock the device enough to move the microphone (so that your caller can no longer hear you) or even knock the device out of the socket, effectively ending your call.  So although I think this is a good device that works well in many situations, it was not usable for me.",3,1
"Decent for the price... The problem with it is the silicone that is cut around the buttons pops up, causing the outer case to come off at the slightest touch. Very frustrating!",3,2
"I'm happy and sad about this speaker! I was playing my music and it seemed after 3hours it just dies and it was on charge for 6 hours lithium batteries do not take long to charge at all and once they do they can hold a charge for 5-7 hours depending on the product. Another thing is again playing my music it just switches off or right to the radio, also you can't tell what song off your sd card is playing if it plays etc etc.... anyways it's very loud but won't play long 3hours at the most..",3,2
"Why settle for less, when you can get a brand new original iPod nano 4GB for Free! I got mine from this web site:  ilikethis.info/ipod-nano",3,1

"Really helps make intallation easier, but two of the tabs on the big harnesses don't click in on the factory harness. I plugged them together and taped them up real good and have had no problems. Still, at this price it still is WAY better than splicing into ignition wires!",3,1
"Hardly anyone uses an external antenna for a cellphone these days.  But, when you need it, you NEED it!  This one works well.  Plenty of cable and good quality connector.",3,1
The sound quality was good,3,1
I was looking for a low price protector for my phone and it was good for a temporary fix. The price was food. It just turned out not the protection I need,3,1
"I bought this as a replacement for an older version I had. My major dislikes:    1. You have to sit and hold down the on/off button for about 5-6 secs before it comes on. So you can't just get in your car, push a button and be on your way...   2. Automatically goes off after about 30secs of idle time so if u pause your ipod say to pick a call, next thing you hear is static. If you don't have a mute or ATT button on ur stereo, not worth it  3. Per the other reviews, high possibility that the ipod will slip when you run through a slight bump    I was better off with the basic one I had before (only lets you switch between 4 pre-determined stations) since it didn't have a mind of its own and had a good, safe grip on my ipod.",3,1
"This is a fine MP3 player, no doubt about it. Plays MP3 and many other formats. BUT it cannot organize folders so is essentially useless for audio books. It doesn't recognize new folders you make. It does not recognize books at all.<br />Good battery life and bright screen are pluses.<br /><br />I feel stuck with mine.",3,2
A case is a great idea since I dont like to leave mine in the car; especially at shopping malls or on the street at night.    This case is pretty good but it would be much better if it was about 3/4 inch bigger on both the length and the width.  I do use it with my tom tom however.,3,1
When I received the amp the power control for the head unit or bass knob was pushed inside if i open the back to fix it it will void the warranty. Such a shame it's a nice looking amp. I will try to get a warranty replacement and hopefully get to write a much better review.,3,2
"I do like this mp3 player - especially for the price of it. The instuction booklet gets some getting used to but does offer some helpful information. Also the touch ide is more like a hard press especially when the buttons you want to press are in teh corner of the screen. But after some playing around and skimming the poor english in the manual you can figure out most things (recalibrate your screen if the corners are not acting right when you try to touch a button there)(not hearing the radio? the earphones have to be attached b/c they act as the antenna and change your radio option from CHINA to USA).    Having said that I do really like this player - it has a built in speaker so you don't have to wear earphones or use a docking station to listen to music or whatever without the headphones. The picturesfrom the camera are ok - that menu (camera) is poorly described in teh booklet and can be frustrating. But I didn't buy it for the camera use - but if I had I'd probably return it. I was looking for a cheap 2nd mp3 player for my ipod which is an older version and quite heavy. This will not replace the ipod but is good for taking to the gym.   I have a HP Touchsmart computer that my music files are stored on - which poses an issue with the mini cd that they send that has the driver. The HP computer doesn't have the cd tray - you just stick the cd in and it pulls it in - so little cds don't work...actually can get stuck if you try that. BUT I have managed to have the computer recognize it as a USB storage device and can pull over my mp3 files to the device that way. But No driver means I can't convert other file types (itunes store stuff) to that player (unless theres some feature i'm unaware of in itunes that converts thier files to mp3 with the song info still attached (song name artist and album - instead of \\""track 1\\"" labels with no song info)    The Other HUGE problem I have is that amazon suggested buying [[ASIN:B000J47W12 SanDisk 2GB SD Memory Card (SDSDB-2048,Bulk Package)]] and this card doesn't fit the slot for the mp3 player. But that's a negative on amazon for suggesting things that don't fit - not on the mp3 itself.",3,2
Works but i can't use my headphones the have an angled jack or other plug ins,3,1
"I had fast shipping and a smooth transaction! Although these cases are cute they do not provide much if, any protection. The tails did not stick very well either. You get what you pay for. My daughter was excited to get them.",3,2
"I have used this battery exclusively for about a month now... while it seems to have about the same runtime per charge as the original battery, it does not have the same dimensions as it is not wide enough to occupy the entire compartment and it is slightly thicker... this causes the backplate to not close properly without a bit of effort while you hold the battery in the proper position... after my G2 is closed and latched, this becomes a non-issue... but to use it as a spare where you have to swap it regularly, it may be... Personally, I prefer when I get replacement products which match the size of the original product...",3,2
At the time I bought mine it never said anything about not coming with the radio holder but the pictures and reviews make you think it will. I just kept it and bought a holder because after talking about a return I would have lost half of what I paid everything else is great,3,2
I wish the external power could come from its base rather than having to be plugged into the actual camera,3,1
Its ok...nothing to get excited about.  No matter which station you use on FM its still not completely clear.  Would not buy again.,3,2
"Was a great deal.  But the cases are cheap plastic and scratch easy.  But w/ 6 you can't go wrong.<br />Stylus doesn't last long.  Already, went thru one.<br />Worth the buy though.<br /><br />I have problems with the ink coming off the pink colored cases.  It's<br />very annoying and took some scrubbing with soap for a few days.  Probably<br />better to get white blue or black.",3,1
"These head phones are not the iPod In ear headphones! But good imitation .I use them for my iPod Touch and it works good, sound is great. If you put them in your ear the right way you wont hear any outside noise and there pretty loud. Overall these are good headphones for the price",3,1
"This item shouldn't be needed, and doesn't do a whole lot. It's is usually used as an attempt to fix something that wasn't installed or grounded correctly.<br /><br />Use of this product almost always means there is another problem you have overlooked.",3,2
"The case looked really cool and I was excited to slap it on the nano.  The challenge is its thinkness around the dial makes it hard to use the spinny control dial.  I tried using both hard or light touch and it didn't seem to help, and the small hands of a kid made it even harder.  Service was prompt and item looked just like what I wanted, but unfortunately it didn't quite work as smoothly as I had hoped for.",3,2
"Had great hopes for this unit as I'm a Mac user and do a lot traveling, taking 400 pictures a day, all in different locations. My biggest dislike about this tracker is that the buttons, which only use a design symbol as identification, must be pushed in combination and sequences that can cause all the data collected for the day to be deleted if not done properly. That, and the ultra-short battery life, make this a \\""re-think\\"" for me.",3,1
"Worked great for about a month, then broke",3,2
"Bought one of these knowing the discount I was getting instead of buying the one in retail packaging.<br />Exactly as described, good sound and I do like the ability of pairing up to 6 phones (only two can be active at a given time).<br /><br />Haven't tested the battery life yet, although I expect to last long. Will update as soon as my testing concludes.<br /><br />Sound quality is good, I can hear loud enough at max volume. Audio is actually louder when connected to a power source.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />Have been using it for a couple of weeks now: Audio quality is good, but what I don´t like is that phones doesn't reconnect automatically.<br />I normally leave the unit switched on all the time, and I usually make short trips where I leave and re-enter the car regularly. I've noticed that the speakerphone doesn't reconnect when I'm in the car again. I have to switch the power off and on to make it work.<br />I'm not even talking about battery life here, just the ability to pair itself when it's not being used for a while.<br /><br />Left one of this turned on all night and next morning it was already with low battery (it was supposed to go to sleep if no phones are active)<br /><br />Not happy.",3,1

"Camera works great, and the customer service from the shipper was excellent.  Came with the latest firmware already installed.  Install was relatively easy, though it took a little while to route the rear camera cable away from the side airbags.  The rear camera needs to stick on glass, tried it on the plastic trim (tinted windows), but it came right off.  Researching this camera made it sound like some massive device.  It is smaller than a smartphone, and just slightly thicker.  Update 11/3/2015:  I have since removed the camera from the car.  Unit requires high end SD cards, not just your average Sandisk cards.  Parking mode worked most of the time, but I would have to disconnect the camera during the day because of the busy road near the car.  If I didn't, it would get extremely hot, and get stuck at the boot screen.  Before I removed it, I was starting to get random reboots, or it would go for hundreds of miles without recording from one of the two cameras.  Maybe I was having problems with voltage because of the car's small (group size 151R) main battery?  Firmware updates made me feel like I was in a beta program.  I'll pull it out of the drawer for my pickup, but for a daily driver, I feel that there are better options.  For what it's worth, my 5-year old nephew figured out how to use it, and thought it was neat to turn on rear view while the car was moving.",3,1
"It doesnt quite hug the edges of a 7inch gps unit and is definitely too tight araound it, it will do the job but dont buy this specifically for the Cobra.... matter of fact, dont buy the Cobra at all.

They don't play many types of mp4s even though they are listed.  They also do not have good support for larger post holes like some of the competition.,3,1
"I got this arm band in the mail hoping it would be the perfect one to use for running, and I was wrong. The band part of it is sort of a neoprene material that is not stretchy, and not very comfortable. The place to hold a key does not have a closure, and I'm a little uneasy about leaving a key in it without wanting to check every minute to see if it fell out. The colors however are nice, and the ipod fits nicely in the designated spot. The case that goes over the screen does not fit on very well which can make it hard to use your ipod without taking it out of the case.",3,2
"This case is only one piece which is completely different than any other case I have had. It completely covers the front and comes even with the front surface of the ipod. Therefore, it does not protect the front of the ipod at all.",3,2
"One of the speakers was not as loud as the other.  BrainyTrade readily refunded my money with no charge for return shipping.  They would have replaced them without issue, but I had gotten the same speakers as a gift and they work fine.  I'd have no problem purchasing the same in the future.  I know stuff happens over which they have no control.",3,2
"I have installed these in a Peterbilt truck. I got this truck 2.5 months ago and the stock 4x6 speakers were blown, they buzed and had no bass. I am on a resticter budget but wanted to make a vast improvement in the sound quality without spending alot(would love to have Focal speakers), I looked for component speakers. No room for 6.5 inch, I had to go with a 5.25 set, and I found these and the specs seem to be good for my needs.<br /><br />First thing I found was that they don't come with detailed instruction(or any at all). There are these little 1/2 egg like mounts for the tweeters, but no instructions on how to use them. It was only by guessing and playing with them that I could figure out how to use them.<br /><br />After making an adapter plate to mount the 5.25 woofers to fit in to the stock speaker holes, it started to get easier. The 4\\"" and tweeters are mounted in the overhead space above the windshield, and I was able to place the crossover the space as well.<br /><br />The speaker wires are 22 gauge which to me seems way to small for speaker that are rated for higher wattage, so I replaced them with 16 gauge with high quality spade and female conectors for a good tight conection.(I need them, Truck shakes alot)<br /><br />Once I had them in I was thinking that there is a reason for the price, they were flat sounding and missinmg any bass. It turned out that what they need was some break in time. After using them for about 3 weeks now, I am very happy with them!<br /><br />I used them with out the speaker covers for a week or two, just to make sure all was working properly. The grills just fit into place and seemed to be a little loose. It turns out they are very loose and all 4 grills have fallen out and will not stay in place. I will make a note once I have figured out a good way to keep them in place.<br /><br />Conclusion, This is not a big name company, but so far I am very pleased with the sound quality, the bass is way better than any 4x6 could everbe! The crossover does not have any adjustments and I find they are bright sound on some music, but it is still being driven by a stock head unit.<br /><br />When I replace the head unit with one with EQ and add a sub, and more power(stock only 7 watts) they should sing like angles.<br /><br />Now they do need improve the instruction, include better wires, and grills that stay in place.<br /><br />Over they are 3 star, sound quality is 4 to 4.5.",3,1
"The case is nice, the color bright and the leather (which is probably not real, I don't know) is nice to the touch.  My Nook fits barely into the case, it sits rather tight, which I guess is a good thing. I have to agree that the buttons are a little uncomfortable to reach. The Power button is the worst.  All in all that is not really too much of a drawback. I hardly ever use the Power button and I am using the touch screen to turn pages.  The stand functionality is why I bought this case and it hasn't disappointed.  Three thing bother me a little about the case.  1. The cover doesn't open to the side, like a book, but you have to flip it down, from the top. It destroys the \\""Book\\"" feeling a little. And it is unnecessary - the Nook is light enough that the Stand function would still work if the cover open around the side instead.  2. The magnetic latch holding the cover closed feels like it is not very secure. Like I mentioned, the Nook just barely fits into the case and if you don't manage to push it in all the way, the latch won't close properly.  3. The THICKNESS of the thing. When the Nook is inside this case, it will have double the thickness of just the Nook alone. It is as thick as my notebook. That makes it too thick to fit into my small everyday handbag - in which the Nook by itself fits in no problem.  The upside of this thickness is, that it probably protects the Nook rather well, should I ever drop it.   Because of the thickness, I have started to carry the Nook around in my hand instead of my purse. But I like to be hands free, so I am now shopping around for a new, slimmer case - and will use this one when I know, I want the stand functionality or will be taking a bigger handbag anyway.",3,2
"When i first put the case on, it would fall off very easily. I was disappointed but at the same time, that is what i had expected considering, it covers the back plate only. I just simply had to bend the edges that were too wide and the case has been working just fine since. Case is NOT designed to protect iPod from shock. That was a bit of a downfall for me. Overall its an OK product. Nothing special at all.",3,1
Okay wire but nothing great. It has a very soft copper wire that breaks and makes a mess of loose strands when cut. I replaced this with another brand that seems to perform better.,3,1

"The case is very pretty and was given to me as a Christmas gift for my Ipod touch 4g which I also received for Christmas.  It was very pretty- and i love the fact it came with a screen protector and cleaning cloth.<br /><br />However the main con to this is the case itself is delicate.  Cases and face plates should protect your Ipod or phone, not be the ones that needs protecting.  I dropped my Ipod trying to hand it to a friend of mine and it hit the couch-a soft, cushiony couch-and the case snapped.  This was less than a month after I got it.<br />It could be a fluke, but be adviced-be careful with them!",3,1
"Having an older car, I was sold on using this device mainly for music from an SD card. It played fine, picked up by stations in California with no worries. The only thing is, the device make is very poor. The button to move to the next song on the device itself does not work. The remote that I received with the device did not work either. I probably could have pushed to return and get an exchange, but it is alright. Why bother?    I haven't figured out if you can shuffle the music on the device through SD card?      I just got a Blackberry. I will try connecting my Blackberry device to it the next time and shuffle through my Blackberry.",3,2

Otherwise spend more and get a better quality one.",3,2
"I used this cable for a short time. It worked in a pinch, when I needed it to, but over all...not the greatest quality replica out there. I often had to wiggle it to get it to catch and start charging...not bad if you don't want to spend the full amount on an actual Apple cord",3,2
i cannot rate this item due to the fact that my son did not do the proper measurements  and therefore it does not fit and is sitting in our family room in the orginal shipping boxes.  Just a word for the wise- before you spend 500.00 plus make sure<br />you do your measurements!,3,2
"The FM transmitter, as other reviews have previously stated, is a waste of plastic. The sound quality of audio sent through the FM transmitter is atrocious, on top of the fact that it needs to be >3\\"" away from the stereo reciever.  The charge cable works as it should though... it charges the zune... in the car..",3,2
"Good quality case, but it does not fit all 10 inch tablets.  The Nexus 10 definitely does not fit.<br /><br />Try this instead:<br />Esme Porter Polyester Sleeve (Black) for Google Nexus 10",3,2
"I got this mp3 player basically because it is wireless, and I wanted something I could listen to while in my art class without having to worry about the wires; because of the price ($15 + approx. $6 shipping), I thought I'd give it a try despite the lack of reviews. <br /> <br />This player is very easy to use, with the controls allowing you to adjust the volume, to go back and forth to different songs, pausing, etc. <br /> <br />One of the disadvantages is that it seems to automatically play the songs according to the artist who wrote them, so numbering songs doesn't allow you to create a unique play list. <br /> <br />The battery charge isn't tremendously long, about 3 to 4 hours, which for me is okay, especially since their isn't a huge amount of memory to store songs on.  You can just drag songs into the player while charging it, so it's very simple to change your music. <br /> <br />The headphones don't fit my ears particularly well, which I found surprising since I have 2 behind the ear headphones that fit really well.  I can get them to fit OK, but they aren't ideal.  Too little space is left between the speakers and the plastic band, and the speakers go out at an odd angle unless you find the right spot to sit them.  Once you do, they're fine. <br /> <br />Despite some flawed design, I give them 3 stars basically for being wireless and easy to use.  I'll stick to my other player for extended listening, but when wires will get in the way of what I'm doing, these are good.",3,1
"First off I paid $30.98 for it so it's not a big expenditure for a car camera. My initial feelings are it'll work for my needs. Here are some of the things I've found out about using it that may be helpful for you.<br /><br />- The picture doesn't auto rotate. So if you mount it on the dash instead of the windshield the video is upside down. You can correct this in most video players, you have to flip and mirror the image to get it to display correctly, but the time reading will be backwards.<br />- To access the menu you can't have it plugged in.<br />- I had to bump the exposure compensation (in menu) up to +2/3 for it to appear bright enough when playing video back.<br />- Trying to play the video back from the MicroSD card while the camera is connected to PC is jerky (especially if you recorded in  HD), better to copy files over to PC to play.<br />- Files copy quicker when the MicroSD card is in your computer vs. connected through camera.<br />- Audio is only so-so. Had problems with loud static periodically when recording, (I prefer audio off, no one needs to hear what I'm saying).<br />- Of the resolution options I find 1080FHD 1920 x 1080 to work best for me. 1080p 1440 x 1080 I don't think is as good as the 720p 1280 x 720. The WVGA 848 x 480 is the lowest I'd consider acceptable and is noticeably poorer than the above.<br />- The mount doesn't pivot left or right, it does up/down and tilting the camera 270 deg., but I'm not sure what the advantage of this is. The lens also tilts up/down, but again I can't see any plus from it.<br />- The mount sticks very well to the windshield, it doesn't have a ball connector like GPS's so aftermarket mounts won't work.<br /><br />Overall I think for the money it's not a bad buy. We'll have to see how well it holds up. It fell of the dash when experimenting with mounting it on the dash a couple of times onto the vehicle floor and didn't break (well a lens of the LED lights came off but it was easy to glue back), so it'snot real fragile.<br /><br />If it holds up, I'll be very satisfied with the money invested.<br /><br />p.s. I bought a 16gb class 4 card as suggested in another review and it works well.",3,1
"This case is somewhat oversized for the GPS it's designed for. Depending on how you use it, that is either good or not so good. If the outer zipper is not pulled at least far enough to block the GPS from falling out, it would be very easy to drop the unit from this case. While a minor inconvenience, it's not a deal breaker for me. Sometimes the strap finds its way into the case, and it can be a challenge to get the GPS into the case if you're in a hurry, which I usually am when I'm putting the unit into the case. The side pocket is quite handy, though, for the USB cable. Other than the risk of the GPS simply falling out of the case, it is good protection against scratches and chips in the GPS' screen.",3,1
"Overall, I am happy with the case and it is exactly what I expected for the extremely low price.<br /><br />1. The case is NOT leather, it's not even pleather.<br /><br />2. The case is 1/8 of an inch too short for the Nook Color. This is not a huge problem for me but could be for some. Trust me, it doesn't sound like much but if you are looking for a case for protection, get something else.<br /><br />3. The item arrived 3 days after the estimated delivery date, however it appeared to be a UPS problem and not the seller's fault so I did not contact them.",3,2
"OK, I purchased this with 103. of my tax rebate money.  I put the rest of it towards credit card balances (sorry, Geo.).  I purchased this from Radio Shack on sale without reading a thing about it, which I normally would never do.      It is worth about 99 dollars, if that.  Had 25 extra watts compared to one the same price at Best Buy and some extra functions too.    I seriously doubt any audiophiles would even glance at this thing.  It is what it is.  An affordable little stereo.  I mainly wanted it to listen to NPR in the mornings- works for that, but thank goodness for instructions- was about to pack it up and return because two of my favorite radio stations would not come in without static- but read in the book that if that happens, there is a button on the remote to help that problem.  It worked.      Alert the press:  I do not own an ipod.  Can't tell you anything about that, but it did play the SD card (with mp3s).  It also played my palm pilot, which I find to be so much better than mp3 players- wireless internet radio, internet, etc.      Anyhoo.  After reading a couple of reviews on here, I will not toss the packing materials for a couple of weeks.      Bottom line:  Don't pay more that around a hundred bucks for it.  Don't purchase it if you want exceptional sound.  It is ok for me, though.    EDITING TO SAY:  The display has already lost sections of letters after only 4 days ownership.  Wish I could lower stars.",3,2
The holster was delivered with a short wait time. The only problem is that the holster only holds the ipod without a case on it. If you keep any ipod case on it will not fit in the holster.,3,2
could be better,3,1
"They work fine, but they're a bit LARGER than a real D-battery. There's no reason for that.  I specifically went with 3xAA cases since they can be as small as D-batteries, guaranteeing they'll fit everything.  Instead, I should have gone for 4xAA cases, since they'll be the same capacity (run as long) as real D-batteries, and CAN be made just as small as these cases are...",3,1
the covers was shipped in a cheap package and was bent i had to fix them to use them but thy worked,3,2
"Takes some getting used to with the odd applications. Would have loved the opportunity to edit the manual myself, since the writer's first tongue is obviously not English.  You have to figure that you can hold a button for 5 minutes but that  they must have meant  5 seconds.  But it works so far and I'll forgive the glitches I had encountered for overall practical uses I got from it.",3,1
"Everything works fine, would like more volume the only problem I have had is the bluetooth headphones have STOPPED WORKING and that's one of the main reasons I purchased this model, I have 3 pair of SONY headphones that either the right or left ear has no sound, I use my headphones when I exercise so I presume my sweat is killing my headphones.",3,1
"This DVR has good features and is fairly easy to set up even though the manual is a typical Chinese production that leaves out a lot of detail and takes some effort to understand.....although it's not as bad as some I've see, e.g. an E-Prance manual.  My biggest complaint is with the zoom lens feature, which is why I ordered this DVR in the first place.  It does not zoom IN while the DVR is recording.  Recording must be stopped, the lens zoomed in, then record started again.  This makes the zoom lens almost useless as a dashcam feature.  Imagine being in traffic and wanting to zoom in on a small object like a tag number.....frustrating at best and easily could be dangerous trying to manipulate the buttons.  I contacted Esky and asked if there was something wrong with my camera or was it designed this way.  They replied that it was designed this way.  To be fair, my Esky contact was relatively prompt with her replies, very courteous, and offered me a full refund including shipping but I decided to keep the camera and use it where the zoom feature would not be needed.  But, if you're looking for a dashcam with a useful zoom lens, this Esky is not the one you want.",3,1
Cheap quality,3,1
The stylus included does not work with Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. But the screen protector and the Case was okay.,3,2
It was not easy to snap on the lid. It slipped out of my daughters hands one time and the top plastic cover cracked.,3,2
"I'm not sure what the use case is for this device. A build-in, dash-mounted display is generally pretty well shielded from glare by virtue of its location. A GPS on top of the dashboard and closer to the windshield may suffer from glare problems, but this sunshade needs to be taped to the GPS to stay in place. Overall, I would say this is a solution in search of a problem, overpriced for what it actually does.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received an evaluation unit in exchange for a fair and honest review.",3,1
"I ordered this for my daughter as a Christmas present. She drives a long way each day & enjoys listening to the fire/police/ambulance calls then.<br />I didn't check as closely as I should have. We soon found out that the SB doesn't have media abilities.  The email I received from BlueAnt folks was great and they let me return this unit with no dragging of their heels. Thanks, Isaac.  You're a peach!<br />My daughter now has an in-car unit that lets her listen to the scanner. She can also listen to audible books.",3,1
"Other than the fact that this cover feels like it is plastic, it is fine. The flap is sturdy as is the cover.",3,1
"On the day I opened my package, I used up a quarter of the 4 GB memory available with music only.  The Fuze I received blacked out within the first hour during playing.  I couln't turn it on properly for the next 3 hours.  Each time I tried to turn it on, the machine went through the welcome screen twice.  Then, the screen froze displaying lines with a single letter or numbler. When I got to turn the mp3 on, the Fuze turned off automatically three times after a few minutes of playing.  The next day, two of the tracks skipped.  Now, it's been two weeks without the inital problems.  Hopefully, the Sansa Fuze 4 GB MP3 continues to perform well for the next two years or so.  :-)",3,2
Doesn't let me use my phone while it's plugged in,3,2
"The adhesive was not that great, we had to get some 3m double adhesive. the lights work great.",3,1
If the remote control worked I would give this five stars. The sound is great and takes up very little space but the remote doesn't work and for that reason I am extremely disappointed. And yes I checked the battery and that's not the problem.,3,2
This product was specifically recommended for the StreetPilot Garmin...no longer made & sold in stores. I was kind of disappointed in that the case is large enough to hold the GPS but there is no space to include the bracket and cable...so we are still not able to keep everything all together...but at least the GPS unit itself is protected.,3,2
"Disappointed, it is not compatible with SD CARD",3,2
"I am really excited that I purchased this product, it has worked very well since I bought it. I would recommend as a purchase.",3,1
"I bought two. One worked and the other didn't. Since they were pretty inexpensive, I didn't mind, but I would not buy these again.",3,2
a bit heavy and tight,3,1
"I purchased this to record my college classes.  When I received the item all I had to do was simply plug it into my ipod, and it immediately recognized it and pulled up the menu for voice memos.  It's so easy to set up and record!  Once I am at home and want to review my notes I find it in the menu organized by date and time and press play.  It's that easy.  There's only one thing that I don't like about it.  There is some strange mechanical sound that can be heard during the recordings.  I thought it might be some power saving option that the ipod itself is doing, so I have experiemented with several settings and have not figured out how to make it go away. It is not during the entire recording, it comes up in cycles, but you can still hear the recordings. However the lectures are picked up loud and clear in stereo with very little outside noise. I would recommend this product.",3,1
"I purchased these in January 2010 and they stopped working in June 2011, so you get what you pay for. I had them professionally installed (don't have them professionally installed...it is a rip off and costs almost twice as much as the headrests themselves). Only the dvd player worked.  I could not get the usb port to do anything and the wireless headphones that came with the set stopped working after 1 month.  I did not try the video game system, but I expect similiar results (ie won't work).<br /><br />The remote worked perfectly and once I purchased better quality wireless headphones for my children, it was a dream come true.  They were kept entertained and I was able to listen to the radio.  A win-win in my book! Here is a link to the headsets I purchased from Amazon as well.  the second set of earphones are for smaller children, but only work on one channel, channel A.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001APRFP2 Audiovox IR2CFF IR Wireless Dual Channel Headset]]<br />[[ASIN:B003053L3U Kidz Gear Wireless Car Headphones For Kids]]",3,2

looks very nice,3,1
"I found this product to be of poor construction. Classic -you get what you pay for. The idea is very good, the buttons, radio tuner, jacks, and speaker sound quality are all pretty shoddy. I dropped the first one off a nightstand and broke it. I ordered a second one and it didn't last much longer.",3,2
It gets very dusty at normal use but it fits perfect sizewise.     I wish they make something more fancy like the Paul Frank Julius products for the iPod Touch or the iPhones. They are fancy and they don't easily get dusty as much as this one does.,3,1
"I thought it would be so much better! Not too bad, but not what I expected neither. I don't like the rubber part that covers the charger and headphone holes.",3,2
"Goes on fairly easy, but be careful where you put your fingers. I put my finger just a little on the edge and that edge didn't stick.  Oh! So That's why there are 2!  :)",3,1
"Love the dual band dual receive feature on this radio. Good transmit and reasonably loud receive audio. I did return it  only because of the battery drain. Using it only in listen mode, I only got 5 1/2 hour per charge on the battery. Contrast that to the Yaesu FT 60R, which gave me 28 full hours of monitoring time.",3,1
"EDIT: I've had this case for about a week or two and already the white inner plastic case has already broken. It split on the side and I'm going to have to glue it or something. I thought this case would be better and more durable. I've only been using it in normal daily activity, haven't dropped it or anything, so it shouldn't have broken. I'm disappointed.<br /><br />ORIGINAL: My previous gen iPod had just a plain old case made from recycled car tire. It lasted me for 3 years and I loved it since it gave my iPod protection without being too clunky (I like to fit my iPod in my pocket after all). I just recently got the new 5th gen and wanted another good case for it. This Full Protection Defender Case is different from my old one and I will outline some of the pros and cons I've found with it after using it for about a week now:<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Very sturdy. I'm pretty sure it would protect my iPod from damage such as dropping.<br />-Classy. It just looks nice and sleek. I got the black and white one and it matches my shoes. :)<br />-Fits perfectly on the iPod. It's snug and doesn't slide off at all, which I was worried about. It fits.<br />-Doesn't slide everywhere. Some cases are so smooth if you set your iPod down it might skitter right off the table. This case helps prevent it from trying to fly away from you all the time. It has a nice weight too: not too heavy, but heavy enough that if it fell out of your pocket you would notice it.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-A bit clunky. Maybe not as thick as other brands but it definitely adds bulk to the \\""sleek and slender\\"" appeal of the iPod touch. I cannot fit it into my jeans pocket anymore with the case on it. I would have preferred a slightly thinner case but of course the bulkiness is part of how it protects the iPod so it's not a big complaint I have.<br />-The silicone bits come loose sometimes. It's hard to explain unless you have it in your hands, but the white (or whatever color you pick) bits on the sides ofthe case have these tiny slots that fit into each other to keep the outer case attached to the inner plastic case. They come out sometimes. It doesn't make the case fall apart but it's a bit annoying to have to fiddle with it and slide them back in.<br />-The biggest con for me was the plastic screen protector. I had to take it off. It left a gap between the screen itself and the protector, and this is an iPod TOUCH isn't it? Thus, when I went to touch the screen, I had to push the protector with my finger down to make it touch the screen. It was just not really functional. I also removed the plastic protector on the back of the case that covers the Apple logo because it arrived with a scratch on it.<br />-The final con is that when little bits of dust or hairs or fingerprints, etc. get on the screen, now that I had to remove the protector, it's hard to clean because the case is higher than the screen itself and I have to disassemble the entire case to fully clean my iPod screen. I think even if I left the protector on, this would still happen. I'm the kind of person who likes to have a very clean screen so I have to do this once every day or two.",3,1
"We have a Samsung Galaxy 3, the phone doesn't sit well on the docking station and isn't able to recharge.  We also had to remove the otter box to try this all out.  We had some issues in the beginning with the Fidelio app, but it is now working.  The actual sound is great!  We are just disappointed about the charging issue.",3,1
"The install was easy and getting the bubbles out was no problem.  There were a couple of odd imperfections in it, however, that left a couple of slight raised areas on the screen.  After some work with a credit card, they are almost completely gone, and small enough that I can live with them.<br /><br />however, the anti-glare creates a less clear screen than other anti-glare protectors i've used.  Also, it shows fingerprints and smudges worse than the clear version, so the matte finish looks dull and dirty all the time.<br /><br />All in all, I probably wouldn't buy this again, based on this experience, but I'll keep it unless or until I find a better alternative.",3,2
Difficult to put on.  Can't really adjust the wheel because of the plastic cover.  Hold the iPod securely.  Better if it had a flap to protect the opening from rain.,3,2
"This cover  is just adorable!!  My only complaint is that when I opened the packaging, the face of the bear has what appears to be a pen mark on it that can not be wiped off.  Could easily return I'm sure,  but I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and don't have time to exchange it.  Considering how much she is going to love this cover, the slight blemish is worth it at this point.",3,1
The picture isn't very noticeable on this.  It shows brighter in the picture.,3,2
Great quality sound system for the price...my wife uses it for cassette tapes of old ( days )...radio works fine.,3,1
I returned this item because it is not compatible with my computer operating system. The camera has a very good picture.,3,2
"The holster arrived fairly quickly, quicker than expected as it shipped from outside of the U.S.  It did not have any wearing instructions included so trying to figure out how to wear the strap took a bit of maneuvering.  There are 3 ends to the strap and I ended up cutting the short one off and using the strap like a belt, which works because I needed something to wear with dresses and pants that don't have pockets.  Definitely worth the small price I paid.",3,1
I bought this case for my daughter's iPod touch.  It is a hard case that protects the back from scratches and it's looks as cute as it is in the pictures.  The problem is it only covers the back and so just a few weeks later she's dropped the iPod touch on a hard surface and broken the glass face.  We're going to purchase an Otterbox Commuter Series for the replacement.,3,1
"This cover is very simplistic, a plastic sleeve for iPod. It remains open at one end, however is sufficiently snug to make removal a chore. The Shades Case provides very effective protection from scratches and exposure to dust and lite moisture. The case provides little or no protection from impacts or drops.",3,1
Not loud enough,3,2
"it fits a little loose. i wish they had said in the description that the cover doesn't attach open. other than that it shipped quickly and does what its supposed to do, protect my nook. thank you.",3,1
Thought it was for 4 speakers but Its only for  2...... But the price was cheap so whatever..... I was fooled by the picture,3,2
"Bought this a few weeks ago for somewhere around 40 bucks shipped. Receieved product about a week later but the only that worked was the radio!!! Paid 15 bucks to send it back (a third for what I bought it for), then had to wait a week and half to get a new one back. This time it had a piece of paper where the cd goes so I dont know if I recieved a refurbished p.o.s. the first time or not. The new one works great and sounds great. Only one thing I didnt notice when I bought it, it has a knob for tuning, not digital, but the stations come in very clear. Hope this helps you out.",3,2
Do you carry just the coaxial cable for the sirio series 5000,3,1
"It charges my iPhone, but it will display a message saying it's not compatible. The plug is a bit bigger than the real apple cord that came with my phone so I have to wiggle it a bit to fit inside the case on my phone, but it does what it's supposed to do.",3,1
"I bought Sony PRS 600 because I had lot of PDF documents technical ebooks, papers etc that I would be able to read and take with me anywhere. 2 days later I returned it because although the device is fairly polished, more or less I found it useless. I bought a kindle 2 instead, and let me say that I'm very happy with the kindle. Here's why:    1. Very Poor Software  The Ebook software from sony is rubbish. It is very sluggish. Mind you it does work, but it is such a drag, that I couldn't see myself using that thing in the long run. It has lot of quirks and is in early stages of development. I would call it beta rather than full. I came across 1 or 2 errors in the 2 days that I used it, for which I had to google and find a solution.    2. Not so impressive Contrast  When I first started reading on the PRS-600, I thought it looked okay, but nothing to brag about. The text was not dark black, it was grayish. Kindle is several times better. On kindle the text is properly black.    3. Limited content  No matter what people tell you about free ebooks from blah blah sites, my experience has been that if you try buying/downloading digital version of a real book, there's a good chance that you may be able to find a kindle version, especially newer books or classic/famous books. But, you probably won't be able to find either a free version or a version that works on the PRS-600. I have searched thro' the Sony book store, and found it had really really limited collection of titles.    4. Limited Functionality  Although I was impressed by touch screen and hand writing notes capability, all in all its just an ebook reader not much else. Touch screen is nice for navigating but feels a little unresponsive because the interface (there's no feedback sound). Hand writing feature is good but of not much use because it also feels unresponsive, due to the delays of eink. And you can only write like 10-15 words on the screen of that size. So, its just an ebook reader and nothing else.Combine 4 with 1, 2 and 3, what you get is an ebook reader which is bad, really realy bad. So, the touch screen is a good cherry to go on the cake, but where's the cake? Kindle on the other hand, is cheaper and comes with Wi-fi, you can read blogs, news and weather on it, and receive updates over the air. These features make kindle really useful and are important features for me.    Overall, I found this a very clumsy device. We live in the world of bluetooth and wi-fi and Over-the-air sync, putting up with rubbish softwares and lousy USB sync is not something I want to do. I found it really hard to find books to read on this. And then if I was fortunate enough to get one, the contrast was pretty bad, I could always see a reflection of my face in the reader. It would render PDFs okay. But I would gladly convert my PDFs to limited text ebooks and read it on kindle, because it looks so much better and darker on kindle. There's very little content available on this device (at least the content that I care about mainly famous books, blogs, news).    You may say that I'm obviously biased about the kindle and against the PRS 600, but mind you I have used both devices and I returned one, for the other.",3,1
"The hot pink is actually dark dark pink. its like a red wash all over the thing so its hard to distinguish the colors. It is pretty, i was just expecting something bolder.",3,1
"Not as good as a sound quality they boasted about, however, it worked good enough to get sound. Either way, a good avg speaker replacement that is cheap",3,1
"The picture is absolutely great and shows sharp detail.  Also, the camera's capability options are extensive so a great plus.  The manual was not easy to understand and lacked detailed instruction.  Although written in English, the manual has many gramatical errors and is not always clear when describing various camera functions and capabilities.  The product originated from China so whoever translated Chineese to English did a very poor job.  Overall, I learned its capabilities by trial and error, pushing various buttons,then observing the results. I also have a problem with the unit powering up sometimes if it sits for 8 hours or more. Sometimes it starts perfectly, other times it takes an hour before starting. You would think it is a low battery charge problem but because it happens intermittently, I do not think the battery charge is the problem, maybe it is a faulty on/off switch.  I circumvented the problem by never turning the unit  off, but simply unplugged the power source.  When I need the unit to function, I plug in the power source and the camera turns on and performs perfectly.",3,1
"CONS  1)sound quality is reduced when using mp3 player through this transmitter  2)had alot of trouble with using a SD card, I would recommend only using the cable with an mp3 player.  3)could not find one station to use without at least some interference, just enough to make me not want to use it.  PROS  1)cheap fm transmitter, but u get what u pay for  2)easy to use.  3)doesnt take up much space in the glove box when u decide not to use it anymore.",3,1
"Works as advertised, and capacity can be confirmed as I have a 1230mAh battery that can be charged twice from 10% to 100% (phone is off during charging, mind you).  Flashlight is very bright.  Button for turning on the flashlight is difficult to feel for in the dark, hence why I docked it one star.<br /><br />Also, you can't charge the battery pack and your phone at the same time (plug wall charger into battery pack, plug battery pack into your phone).  Your phone doesn't charge and you end up with a slower charge on your battery pack.  This was another dock on the product.<br /><br />Overall, good, but I'll be looking elsewhere when this pack dies.",3,2
"I really liked this phone case when it arrived. I'm a girly girl, so I'm all about sparkle! The case held up pretty well for the first few weeks, then it began loosing a rhinestone here and there. About 2mo in though, one side started peeling off. It's an ok case for the price, don't expect to have it for a year though.",3,1
Would be nice if it fit the ipod a little more snugly. Also if the adapter/charger fit the Zune would be good.,3,1
Sound quality is OK.,3,1
cant beat the price but you get what you pay for. very poor quality. does not stick to ipod. would not buy again or recomend to a friend,3,2
"This is a hard plastic cover that clips around the Creative Zen.  The cover has openings to accomodate buttons, the card slot, the hard reset hole, headphone jack, etc.  The cover fits very snugly and is quite nice.  My only complaint is with the belt clip.  There is a disc-shaped piece that is removable from the belt clip.  This piece needs to come apart, where half of it will go into the back part of the case and attaches to the other half on the back side.  You can't really tell when they're together, but this piece is screw off, NOT snap off.  I ended up breaking the disc trying to figure that out.",3,1
"Worked well. ONLY complaint is wire twisted off the charging wire end after maybe a month. Transmitter still works well, just can't charge. will get another and macguyver a duct tape strain relief system.",3,1
Would give it 5 stars but I bought as a gift and when I received it the box looked awful. As if it had not only been torn open but completely torn up.,3,2
The nook case was good but the screen protector wouldn't go on. Also the light that I received doesn't even work. They should just sell the case and make it cheaper.,3,2
worked great,3,1
got suckered into this unit just by looking at the 2 way remote. it appears to be chrome and of some type of metal finish but its not. its silver plastic in front and even cheaper black plastic in back. besides that the features are very exceptional and useful. another thing trigger delay is about 2 seconds. may not sound bad. but its a little annoying especially when the stock remote is instant,3,1
"Fits a bit different than I had anticipated. Purchased to use with GPS on motorcycle; I remove the unit from my bike when I'm going to park for a while. The shade makes it a bit difficult to get to the tab to remove it easily, so I'm thinking that it would work better as an application for a vehicle. Looks nice though.  :-)",3,1
Charges my iPod through the iHome but does not transfer Audio. It was disappointing because I wanted to play my new iPod through my iHome at college.,3,2
"Welcome to knock-off city. When the case arrived, it smelled like a combination of a tire lot and smoldering plastic. Then had to use scissors to trim the excess fabric in order for the zipper to close properly. It was cheap and with a few adjustments, you can make it work.",3,2
At first I really loved this case. It's really cute and protects well! But a little over a month later it began to fall apart and now it's barely holding together.,3,1
"I really like the design, but it is pretty much impossible to get off. I have to take the case off to plug it into my ipod dock player and had to use pliers to get it off the first time. Thinking about not even using it because it is so hard to take off.",3,2
I purchased the sim card slot. I was alright with it. I had to modify it by sanding down the edges with a file so that it would slide in and out of the Iphone smoothly.,3,1
"I would rank the Kington Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker as being just okay, mediocre. I have many of these wireless bluetooth speakers that have been offered to me in exchange for an honest appraisal, but this one falls into the average range compared to the others I own. It looks decorative and stylish, the simulated woodgrain patten is very pleasing to the eye, and it pairs easily with my mobile devices. However, the sound suffers in bass response (nonexistent), and the overall sound is tinny, not crisp, and definitely not clear. It also distorts at higher volumes.<br /><br />The buttons on the speaker are not user-friendly, and the \\""receive call\\"" button wouldn't work most of the time. It disconnected my call on a couple of attempts, so I do question it's reliability while using the hands free feature. There are no directions, so if you are inexperienced with Bluetooth speakers, you are basically out of luck.<br /><br />If you are searching for good sound for your music and reliable hands free phone answering, there are much better choices available.",3,2
"Initially I was more than happy with this machine, it worked well and was simple to use. I added the Australian maps for a trip down under. The machine worked well for the first 45 minutes there and then it froze and turned itself off. I reset, but within a few minutes it froze again. This was repeated a number of times until it simply would not start and came up with an error. Tom Tom in Australia were most unhelpful, and I was forced to buy hard copy maps to get around. I have returned home now but the problem is still unresolved. I keep hoping that one day I will be able to again use my expensive piece of equipment!!",3,2
"This product was what I expected, except it doesn't quite fit my iPod.  It must have been stretched before I received it because one corner doesn't hug the iPod and it makes it difficult to turn the screen off and on. I am pretty satisfied with the product except for that one draw back.  Overall this is a pretty good product.",3,1
"not very intuitive on the menus and controls, You get used to it, but definitely not a normal set of button sequences",3,2
"yeah it hooks up but only works 70% of the time, it will work then i will turn the vehicle off then turn it back on and it will say searching, thought it was a bad connection, it seems not. oh well, when it does work I get to jam.",3,2
"This worked for about 8 months before it died and I had to buy a new one. I am glad at least it lasted that long, rather than die in 2-3 months. I recommend spending some more money buying from a retail store and not getting this cheap on the Amazon Marketplace. You will get more for your money. But this did its job at least for the time it lasted.",3,2
"In the long run, I was disappointed with this cable. The cable feels flimsy and insecure. It stopped working completely in less than two months of moderate use. The right and left speakers will randomly switch off depending on the angle of the cord like a broken set of headphones. It'll still work if you hold the iPod jusssst right on it's side. Needless to say, this is a pain and I've found a more heavy duty replacement.",3,2
"Great business, price was right on. You pay for what you get...",3,1
some of these cases were hard to fit on my daughter's iPod.  They would fall off without warning.  Some fit well.,3,1
long wait to get and very thin. I love the color but wish it was thicker...thank you for you time,3,1
"I mainly purchased this bundle for the case and screen protector. The silicone case fits snugly over my Zune, with adequate access to ports and buttons and added texture for grip on the back. The teal green pictured is completely wrong, however. The item that arrived at my door is more of a limeade green. Besides the color being way off, the part of the case that rests over the left-hand music control on the Zune doesn't lie evenly over the button, but doesn't cause any issues. The screen protector is good quality and was applied easily. Nothing amazing but works just as I expected it to for the price.    On the other hand, the belt clip is stiff and feels rather flimsy. The arm band is made of cheap, rough fabric that you would probably only want to wear over a shirt. It's elastic and adjustable (the Velcro holds really well) up to a diameter of about 4.5 inches. Personally, though, having owned thin silicone cases in the past, I would expect the silicone to rip with continued use. So if you're looking for an mp3 case to clip onto your belt or strap onto your arm while exercising or working, look elsewhere.    As for the key chain, it is made out of a flexible matte rubber or silicone material. Kinda neat--if you like fish bones. Just kidding. You can use the key chain to wrap up your ear bud or headphone cord with to keep it from getting tangled in storage.    Shipping was fast, which is always appreciated.",3,1
The finish on the case was lovely when we got it but it is already chipping. So I guess you get what you pay for...,3,2

Was able to use flash my E82 with MHD Flasher and an Android tablet. Was not able to install included software by following the instructions on a Windows XP laptop. Also could not get laptop to recognize the cable or install drivers.. Will keep trying and revise review if I ever get it to work.,3,1
I guess this is the type of product that you should go see in the store. With so many end of the year sales I could have done much better. It's good enough but I regret buying and it's too much trouble to pack up and send back. So here it sits..........regrets!,3,1

"I bought this for my girlfriend as she wanted to try an armband for her ipod while working out. It worked ok in the beginning, a little issue fitting the ipod in with the headphones. After awhile it basically fell apart, but for a few bucks there's not much more to expect.",3,2
"This is a beautiful pink.  Absolutely love the color.  But it has an embossed lion ish thing on it with the word coodio also embossed on the front and the back, not keen on that, (could not see that detail when purchasing).  In spite of LOVING the color...<br /><br />This case is not super functional.  The case has 2 clips to hold the nook in place, but they are on the far left very near the spine of the cover, there is nothing else to hold the Nook glowlight in place.  Also, the cover does not have a latch, snap, elastic or any other way to keep it closed, so when you shove something into your purse, the cover spreads apart and the nook falls out. The strap on the left side is supposedly to hold the cover while you read, each time I've tried this, the Nook Glowlight just pops out of the case and falls in my lap.<br /><br />If you are looking for a nice cover to protect your glowlight from dust and bumps, at home, not on the go...this is a good one.  If you are on the go with yours, you might want to keep looking.",3,2
"This adapter is passable. The hands-free is decent, although the microphone has trouble picking up my voice. The Bluetooth audio playback works well, but there is no pause button on my car's radio. The price is great, though.",3,1
Bought to try to use it with my Blood glucose meter.<br /> I couldn't use it I need a special cable. Oh well tried,3,2
The case seems to be what was ordered but doesn't fit the iPod very well. It fails to snap over the corners as it should to securely fit.,3,2
"I was very excited bout getting a cover for my new Nook. Everything that came was nice. I thought the skin would cover more but it was okay. For what I paid it was a good deal. It looked a little cheaper than I expected, but it still looks nice on my Nook all put together. The screen protector I thought I didn't need but liked a lot.",3,1
"I expected something else, this unit is not bluetooth ready and everything else is a add on to the unit. I didn't do my research before buying but the sound is great...",3,1
"I was excited to see a cover that could be propped up or held in one hand. On the positive side, it does that.  On the minus side, the hinge feels floppy.  Some of the trim on the edges of some of the components peeled off within two weeks of receiving the item.  I am giving serious thought to buying a different cover.",3,2
Honsetly there isnt anything wrong with the sound on the speakers but the volume is very low compared to some others that I've used.  The installation was a pain because they do come with brackets to help mount them into your door but it is flimsy and plastic and you need to bolt the speaker onto the bracket before mounting it on the door.,3,1
"Works pretty well, does not charge my i pad reliably transmitter works very well. Not bad for the price b",3,1
"I bought the spot scrubber because of all the five star reviews it recieved, but I was a little disappointed.  It does get the spots up, but I don't think it really does a better job than a  spray cleaner, scrub brush and towel.  You can also only use the product for horizontal use only.  For a big wet mess I suggest a shop vac to suck up the liquid.  I wish I had saved my money for the regular large type carpet cleaner.",3,2
IT DIDN'T CAME ON ITS ORIGINAL APPLE BOX. IT CAME IN A BROWN BOX WITH NO INSTRUCTIONS OR ANYTHING..,3,1
"The arm band is ok.  It does what it needs to do, which is hold the Nano while you're running.  However, my complaint is that the plastic cover is too thick, and the buttons and scrolling doesn't work well, so I end up sliding the thing in and out a lot, or having it hang out to where I can reach the skip button easily.      A few people were complaining about it being small, and I'm female with skinny arms, and I have plenty of room to grow, in case I end up getting really ripped or something.      There's an extra little velcro thing on the side, that I'm not sure what it's supposed to be for,  but I use it to hold the headphones when they're not in use.  Kind of a handy feature.",3,1
"Comes in handy, occasionally. You can let a freind listen to a song w/out swapping earbuds.",3,1
"I bought the warranty at the same time for a Panasonic TV 06/26/2012. I bought through Amazon Warehouse sold open box.  This means it was sold as new and still covered under the manufacturer's warranty for 1 year. I got the Square Trade coverage for another year after that because that is what their terms of service says it will do - start when the manufacturer warranty expires.<br /><br />14 months after the purchase, the TV started buzzing.  I have been fighting with them for a week and Square Trade has continued to refuse to honor the warranty stating coverage started from the date of purchase EVEN THO MY SQUARE TRADE ACCOUNT SHOWS THE TV WAS PURCHASED NEW AND THAT THE PANASONIC WARRANTY WAS IN EFFECT!<br /><br />I will never buy coverage from them again and will actively encourage everyone to seek other coverage.<br /><br />UPDATE 09/17/2013 - Well after a few phone calls where I kept my cool but made it know that I was severely irritated, I was able to get SquareTrade to honor the warranty.  I got the repairman to come out, replace the circuit board on the TV and, aside from annoyingly missing the repair time window, it went smoothly.<br /><br />Why 3 stars?  The @#$!% that I had to go through to get them to honor the warranty ate up many hours of my life.  I'm still peeved about that.  However, once we got things rolling it was as nice as an experience as I would have expected.<br /><br />Final word - if you buy through Amazon Warehouse and get a SquareTrade warranty, your ST account will show the item is new which would mean the manufacturer warranty is in effect from the purchase date.  DON'T BELIEVE IT at least as far as SquareTrade is concerned.  Even though that information will load into your ST account directly from Amazon, you should still contact the manufacturer and get something in writing showing that the warranty is in effect.  While I did talk to Panasonic last year on a similar matter because Square Trade told me to...since the TV was sold new (see where I'm going with this), I did not get Panasonic to send me anything in writing.<br /><br />If you don't do this, you will have an experience like I did.  ST kept telling me it wasn't their fault because they only imported the information from Amazon which I was told they do not verify and their records showed the TV was sold as used (this meant the 1-year ST warranty started immediately at purchase and not when the Panasonic warranty expired a year from purchase).  However, I had no way to know that and the info in my account did show the TV was new (meaning the Panasonic warranty was in effect).<br /><br />Will I buy from SquareTrade again?  I just did for the microwave I purchased but not from the Amazon Warehouse this time.  It was $8 and I do not expect to have the same experience.",3,2
"On the ipod touch it says that charging is not supported with this accessory. I bought it so it would charge while I was listening to music. Now when I'm done I have to charge my ipod.

"I got this mp3 player because it was such a great price and because of the expandable memory slot.  i have yet to fill the whole thing up.  i just keep the songs in there that i want to listen to, or old favorites and i've been very happy with that.  and removing/adding files is sooo easy.<br /><br />The player itself is so tiny, yet feels sturdy!  i was pleasantly surprised.  it came with a nice neck strap, but the earphones were a little too big for my ears (most are).<br /><br />one AAA battery is what runs the thing and i can listen for quite a while before replacing a battery.<br /><br />the only, and really, i mean ONLY downfall to this player is that you cannot randomly listen to your songs if you've arranged them into files.  you can EITHER put playlists together, entire lists of songs from the same artist, etc OR put all your songs into one big playlist and listen to it randomly this way.  i didn't like this because i wanted to be able to organize the songs by artist so i could find them easier, but also be able to listen to every song i had on the player randomly.<br /><br />there are lots of players out there that could do this but at a much higher price, so i will probably just keep this player for now.",3,1

"I might not be the best to review this unit as it seems that most people have great results with it, but in my case I get a lot of white noise, and the transmitter will start to scan while I drive, making it a hassle to keep the MP3 player on. That said I live in a rural area with a lot of hills, and between a couple large cities. If I where in the LA area or even out of the mountain area where I live it might work fine. So please take that into consideration.",3,1
"This wire is copper, not CCA, and it does appear to be 10 awg.  The wire is very flexible, the stranding very fine.  It would be hard to actually measure the diameter cross section as the stranding is so fine and distorts.<br /><br />I bought both red and black wire. the red insulation is transparent.<br /><br />I inserted this wire into 45 amp anderson powerpoles, and the lack of stiffness made it difficult to get the contacts to Click in place within the connectors.  I have run this wire inside some Hella Optilux foglights to replace the 18 awg they came with.  I fear for the heat resistance of this wire's insulation, as it does not list a temperature rating.  Hopefully the 15 amp fuse to the relay is actually 15 amps, and it never blows.<br />This wire does say proudly made in the USA though.<br /><br />I wish I just bought tinned marine wire from genuinedealz.com instead.  similar price, better insulation, free shipping.",3,2

But my iPhone 5s also would never become 100% charged even if I left the phone connected to a power outlet for several hours using these cables.<br /><br />On the bright side, the cables allowed me to play music on my iPhone 5s while it was connected to a USB connection in my car. It's strange how one feature works but another doesn't.<br /><br />Since I purchased these cables to charge my phone, I returned them for a full refund without any hassle.",3,2

"I have had issues with this product, but I think the main reason is because my lighter is so close to my ignition so I tend to bump it all the time.  I keep it plugged into my lighter at all times because of other reviews I read.  Sometimes it turns off when I touch it to change the song.  I don't know if all my bumping has loosen it or what.    I like the remote, but it seems like you have to hold it up and point it to the holder.",3,1
"I like the little MP3 but it has some major drawbacks.  I like the size and shape.  They play real great.  I don't know if I'm using it right because of the lack of instructions.  The biggest minus for the player is that the battery only last about an hour and a half .  There is no way to determine the state of the battery charge, therefore it is not very good for use on extended trips in the car.",3,1
"Had a problem with the first one but they replaced it and the second on did real good for a while. What can i say, for the price i got my moneys worth.",3,1
"When applied, it creates a rainbow effect. Most people say that it's only noticeable when the phone is off; however, if you have even a remotely dark background or are doing something that the screen isn't really bright, it is very noticeable.

"***** Update 12/30/2014 ********  I switched to a Windows phone and noticed the Sphero app, so I took this out again. I really enjoyed the new app, as do my sons. One game is like \\""hot and cold\\"" where you find hidden depots with the Sphero beeping faster and changing colors when you get close. The other part of the app has a video with Sphero's origin story and a game that successively builds skills.    I teach and some students had some fun recently playing with the APIs.     I wanted to update the review to recognize that this product is getting better and more fun with time. I appreciate the extras put into the new app. Unfortunately there is only the one app for Windows Phone (there are others, but they are just drive control pads.) I'll break out the iPad and see if any of those apps (or new apps) provide a significantly improved experience.    ********************************  As an engineer, I can't help but be enamored by the technology and design of this wonderful little orb. Sphero is amazing to watch as it maneuvers on your command and the designers have put some features in (a tail, little tricks) that make the toy a bit more endearing, almost like a pet. There are some clever apps to let you drive Sphero around the house or over zombies. Or you can use Sphero as a controller to shoot down aliens and ingest energy pods. The color and movement are put to good effect.    But I don't use it. My 16 year old son has lost interest. An my 8 year old boys lost interest after just a few tries. So I can't recommend it.    First off, the control is very cool, but not good enough for the space we have. I think our home is about average in size with mostly hardwood floors. Perhaps we have a few patches of open space that are 5'x8' or 6'x6'. These spaces, however, are not large enough to control Sphero easily. Typically he (our is named Sphred) goes out of bounds and ends up under the couch or hitting the furniture. When he bounces, the calibration on direction gets off, so you have to readjust his tail to continue. Perhaps it is meant to be part of the challenge to account for the momentum, but it is a very frustrating learning process.    When the virtual reality features kick in, it is doubly frustrating because Sphred is always leaving the screen. I go to shoot a zombie on the side and off it goes, I then have to align the tablet (I'm using an iPad), find him again, and then line up the next shot. I tried being closer and further and lowering the speed, but I've found it more frustrating than fun or challenging.    The best use so far has been as a game controller. In one incarnation it controls yaw, forward, and lateral movements of a space ship. The spaceship is always firing, so gameplay is mostly moving and aiming. The other case is color grab, where your reflexes are tested to see if you can pick up the Sphero when it is a particular randomly chosen color. It is fun for a short while, but not captivating.    I tried adjusting the power, and that helps control a bit, but it still remains very difficult. I tried him in a carpeted room and the carpet was too deep for him to start (although he could keep on going if he was already rolling.)    I still plan to use it and play with it to see if there is more to it with the ramps and such; I just haven't gotten around to doing it and think part of that is the excitement has dwindled substantially.    I feel bad about this review because it is a remarkable device and I have the highest respect for those who developed it. However I can't recommend it because just being cool isn't enough in this case.",3,1
"The good: charges all iPods, excellent sound quality, works just like a giant CD changer (control from steering wheel, pauses when the power is off, etc.)    The bad: No display of titles, and my unit stops working intermittently. It's not this adapter's fault that it can't show titles, as it is using the external CD changer interface. The intermittent breakage is a real problem. It doesn't seem to be a cabling issue, as I reseated all the cables and that didn't help. (The cables are cheap, and the dock connector is compatible but not the Apple style you see on higher end docks). The only thing that seems to work is disconnecting the power to the stereo. Then it works again for a couple months.    When it works, I love it.",3,1
"I used it for my flying every now and then. I didnt really like the design after a couple of times. First, if i put too many plastic sleeves on the sides, it becomes pretty heavy and when i write stuff on the paper board at the back, the sleeves kinda block my thrust controls. And the paper clip at the back isnt very sturdy as well, i find sheets of paper slipping out every now and then. In summary, you can find a better kneeboard for the same price out there IMHO.",3,1
"The reviewers before me seem to be quite impressed with the Konaki Digital Media Player's video capabilities, and rightfully so considering it supports AV in/out, AV in recording, and video playback on a big, high pixel-density screen.  The package even includes all necessary cables and software to utilize the player's capabilities.  Even more surprising is that the Konaki accepts 4GB non-SDHC cards (tested with a Transcend) so you actually aren't limited to 2GB.  I don't know of any other media player under a hundred dollars that offers these features; the ones from Archos and Coby are at least two hundred dollars whereas the Konaki Digital Media Player I bought on Amazon was only forty-five bucks new including shipping and handling.  And truthfully, Konaki's Media Player isn't really worth much more than that.    As hinted before, the Media Player has great potential as a portable video player.  You can record videos from any source that can output through an RCA cable at high framerates and bitrates making for smooth, crisp video playback on the lovely bright screen--rest assured videos are very watchable on the Media Player.  However, the problem isn't with the video quality, but with navigation.  You can scroll through a list of video files easily enough with the tiny joystick, but once you've selected a video to watch, be prepared to watch it all in one sitting--there is no resume/bookmark function and fast-forwarding is painfully SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW.  There's a switch to shut off the screen without turning off the player, but the battery will still die out in a matter of hours.  If you exit a video, especially ones over 5 minutes long, you won't be able get back to where you left off easily since the fast-forward function is only twice as fast as the regular playback speed.  You can work around this by splitting videos into shorter segments using a video editor.  Personally, I use Avidemux, but only after I run the video through a program called iriverter since Avidemux can't properly read videos recorded by the player or encoded by the included video converter.  The Konaki actually doesn't play MP4, but ASF instead, and not the standard ASF either (Trancscode, Mencoder, and FFMPEG can't convert to this type of ASF).  Unfortunately for me, I bought this player for my grandmother who doesn't own a computer, and even if she did, I doubt she'd know how to turn it on let alone use editing software.  Even worse, the player doesn't offer any sort of folder/tag browsing, so all of your videos will be piled under one long list.  This problem is further compounded by the player's habit of listing files according to the order they were loaded.  As a result, it's rather unwieldy to have multiple video files.    Audio files also suffer from the same problems--no tag/folder browsing, slow fast-forward, and files being listed in the order they were loaded.  It's even worse since scrolling through that one list of songs is quite slow and since file names are limited to a scant 6 characters.  This is a shame since like the video quality, the audio quality is quite good, just a level below my old 2nd Gen iPod Nano.    Another very annoying quirk is the internal calendar and clock's continuous use of and thus drain on the battery, even when the unit is shut off.  And once the battery is completely drained, you have to reset the date and time.  Not really a huge hindrance so much as a nuisance though.    However, despite my rather long-winded complaint, I don't regret my purchase too much.  I bought the player mostly so my grandmother could bring around photos and videos of my family, especially ones that capture events that she's missed due to how far apart we live from each other.  Now she can watch baby videos of my little brother who she didn't meet until he was 4 years old.    In conclusion, Konaki's Digital Media Player is good for light use when you need something to keep you occupied or during long trips when you can watchan entire movie in one sitting.  Music, audio book, and movie enthusiasts will have to look elsewhere for their more demanding needs.  The player's only real value is in its video, audio, and voice recording abilities, which it does reasonably well, though don't expect videos to be anywhere near dvd quality.  If you can find this player for around fifty dollars, I can easily recommend it for those who could use it for these functions.  Otherwise, you're better off buying an Archos or a Coby.",3,1

I was getting a IPod Touch and I liked the color of the case and I wanted to pick out a cheaper case then the cases in the stores that are like 20 dollars. This case was like 2.50. It doesn't break the IPod if you drop it, it occashionally comes off the IPod. It gets slippery cause it's silicone and I usually drop it cause of that. The other bad thing is it is a little big for the IPod so it slides a little in the case, because of that there eventually becomes holes in all the corners. The case works out good other than that.",3,1
"The description was good, however, I have intermittent issues with what it will charge.  Charging of iPhone 5 works with no issues, but sometimes it wont charge my iPad.  Could be just an issue with this specific cable (maybe I received a bad one).  Product claims certified but I'm not sure what exactly that means.  Either way, it's not a bad price for what you get.",3,2
I like this little speaker but its kind of bulky....I had one before buying this one that was not quite so heavy. It has a good sound but almost too much base and you can't adjust it.  Can't beat the price so good buy for the price.,3,1

Well I mainly bought this for my iPod classic because I have no port to plug in.  At  first I couldn't figure out how to get it to work had someone else try still couldn't not until I wrote to the company and they sent a response telling to go to this YouTube web sight which they  should have included a note would have may it a lot easier.    I finally got it working I have 2 problems.  First  is no matter what station I have it on I get static second problem it's not strong enought to hold the iPod classic it keeps falling over and disconnecting I've adjusted  the insert  way they told me but it's still  falling over.   I decided to keep it instead of returning this product it's working ok,3,2
"Bollywood actors Nana Patekar, Anil Kapoor, and Feroz Khan play mobster brothers who dream of marrying their younger sister Sanjana (the gorgeous Katrina Kaif) into a respectable family.<br /><br />It's a pretty convoluted plot: Rajiv (Akshay Kumar) is kind of a geeky auctioneer whose uncle is really, really obsessed with finding the ideal wife for him, \\""ideal\\"" meaning that the girl has to come from the most honest and decent family (Rajiv's uncle has already turned down over 500 prospective marriages so far).<br /><br />Then, one day, Sanjana and Rajiv meet in the midst of a raging fire, and Rajiv is instantly smitten.<br /><br />Independent of this, and because Bollywood is fueled by longshot, crazy coincidences, a marriage proposal - with Rajiv and Sanjana as the intended couple - is struck between Rajiv's uncle, Dr. Ghungroo, and one of Sanjana's mobster brothers, Uday Shetty. But Dr. Ghungroo promptly finds out that Uday is a crime lord. You can see where the conflict is, right? Ghungroo, his wife, and Rajiv hastily flee to Sun City, South Africa, where Ghungroo comes up with a plan: Get Rajiv quickly wedded and pretend that he's been married for three months now and just hadn't told his uncle. But, then, guess which soon-to-be-bride Ghungroo unwittingly selects for Rajiv? That's right: it's Sanjana, who's also visiting Sun City. And, this time, she falls in love with Rajiv.<br /><br />And, with this Bollywood flick being two and a half hours long, that's only half the story. It turns out, the only way Dr. Ghungroo will approve Rajiv's marriage to Sanjana would be if her hoodlum brother, Uday Shetty, goes straight. You can see the dilemma, right? It's a good thing that Uday Shetty harbors longtime aspirations of being an actor and that the other mobster brother, Majnoo Bhai, is a painter. Because those facts come into play as Rajiv and Sanjana devise a scheme to reform her brother. Thank goodness cute Mallika Sherawat is around to lend a hand (she enters halfway in the picture).<br /><br />Oh, and there's also a fleeting plot thread centering on the \\""Godfather\\"" of them all. He gets involved when his hostile son, Lucky, gets upset at Rajiv for attempting to set Uday and Majnoo on the straight and narrow. Lucky's harsh words and a chandelier propel the remainder of the story.<br /><br />WELCOME, a 2007 Bollywood offering, is the third reteaming of Akshay Kumar and Katrina Kaif. But diminished is the chemistry between Akshay and Katrina, which was so palpable in [[ASIN:B000R939DY Namastey London DVD]] and also present in [[ASIN:B0016GOKYO Humko deewana kar gaye]]. Maybe it's because their love story takes a backseat to all the comedic shenanigans. What's more, Akshay Kumar, who covers yet another nerdy role (although not as nerdy as in [[ASIN:B000KJT7X2 Jaan-E-Mann]]) is often sidelined so that the gangsters can have more screen time. Katrina gets even fewer moments on camera. Meanwhile, Mallika Sherawat is reduced to basically cameo spots. And, while the acting ranges from good (Patekar, Kumar) to decent (Kapoor, comedian Paresh Rawal as Dr. Ghungroo) to negligible (Kaif, Sherawat), I must say the most over-the-top performance comes from Feroz Khan, who plays the \\""Godfather.\\"" Kaif and Sherawat, by the way, look absolutely ravishing. But, next time, give 'em more to do.<br /><br />In the end, WELCOME is merely an okay Bollywood flick. Not great, not even very good, but not a disaster, either. I'd rank it as somewhere just a shade above average. It's pretty hokey and I couldn't help but notice that there's a bit of [[ASIN:0780625277 Mickey Blue Eyes]] going on in this film, and that, like Hugh Grant's character, Rajiv is also an auctioneer. At a running time of two and a half hours, the plot has plenty of time to wander around and mingle and peer into sock drawers. There are some good comedic bits, but, mostly, the unsubtle humor falls thuddingly flat. The schemes the characters concoct are pretty lame, particularly the one involving Mallika simultaneously romancing both Uday and Majnoo. How was that ever gonna turn out well? Then Mallika shows up in the same room with them, and with each guy thinking that she was his girl? Aw, c'mon! Another dumb bit is when Dr. Ghungroo passes himself off as a corpse, knowing the corpse's father was about to see the body. How was that one gonna work? Thankfully, the ending saves the film. The second half of WELCOME is ridden with plot complications which keep piling up, paving the way for a complicatedly wacky climax, which does turn out to be pretty hilarious. But I sure wouldn't want to play RDX's version of \\""Passing the Parcel\\"" (think Musical Chairs).<br /><br />I got a chuckle from that quick George Bush joke thrown in.<br /><br />Here's a paragraph on the songs, of which there are five, with me liking each one. Although not seamlessly integrated into the film, every number, including the title song (played during the closing creds), is energetic and colorful and fun. Malaika Arora (she, whose lips are \\""as soft as rose petals\\"" and whose beauty is \\""as intoxicating as wine\\"") shows up to perform in the sexy specialty item \\""Hoth Rasiley.\\"" I loved the wonderful tracks from NAMASTEY LONDON, and \\""Kola Laka Vellari\\"" and \\""Ek Uncha Lamba\\"" succeed in mimicking the flavor of the NAMASTEY LONDON songs (like \\""Chakna Chakna\\"" and \\""Rafta Rafta\\""). \\""Kola Laka Vellari\\"" and \\""Ek Uncha Lamba,\\"" in fact, are the ones which stand out the most to me.

great if you need an adapter to plug into something,3,1
"Some elastic covers, such as the Speck Skin Tight, defeat the purpose of the Nano by adding too much bulk to their case. However, the Speck Deluxe Nano cover does have a thin clip-on attachment that fits the profile of the Nano perfectly. On the other hand, Audio Outfitters' cover greatly compliments the thin, sleek features of the Nano, but the belt clip-on attachment is too big and defeats the design of the case. There is also a nice clip-on attachment called \\""The Shadow\\"", made by Groove Talent Limited and is sold through some Radio Shack stores. It has an even sleeker design and attaches directly to the Nano with no cover, case, or skin included. Unfortunately it offers too little shock/scratch protection and a slippery surface that does not adhere well to shirt pockets (and does not fit Audio Outfitters' or Speck's Skin Tight cases). Why doesn't some company develop a slim, tight protective cover with a thin clip-on attachment that does not slide off easily when clipped to a shirt pocket ? Since the primary attraction of the iPod Nano is its small size it seems like an obvious concept. So far I haven't seen the product out there with all of these traits in common.",3,2

"When I received it, it was all black. Black silicone and Black arm band. not pink as advertised.

I don't have a skinny upper arm and this is almost to big for my arm. I had to wrap it funky to get it to fit right. I'm going to keep it b/c I am desperate for an armband since my other one has seen its last workout and this one will work okay for now. But I wouldn't tell a friend to buy this.",3,2

I guess after reading the reviews I expected more. It's a little speaker and that's what it sounds like. The reviewers that said this speaker has good bass must have cotton in their ears as bass is non-existent. That being said product arrived on time and was packaged well. I'll keep it around as the small footprint works well in my kitchen and it sounds slightly better than an old transistor radio,3,1

Luckily, I can still justify the price with the other products in the package. I love my old  Sansa clip...the new one Is CHEAP! My advice, send the product straight back if you see the R.",3,2
"How is it possible that they can make a CD player that sells for less than the price of a CD?  Really, you can't go wrong with this thing, you can think of it as disposable, use it for a few days on a trip and if it breaks toss it.",3,2
"This is a good case. There is enough room to accommodate the Lightning-to-30 pin adaptor. It is quite slippery though, especially on upholstery, even from your hands. It tends to minimally scratch in the back. It provides good access to controls. The included screen protector is sub-par. Though it is easy to install and air bubbles can be easily moved to the edges, it scratches way too easily. I think I am happy with it overall. I have 2 of them for 2 devices, with only one screen protector being used.",3,1

"The Zen Mozaic overall is a good unit. The only problem I had was with the battery life.  Creative said the life was 32 hours.  When I rec'd the Zen the best battery life was appx 15 hours, now after 2 years the battery life is down to appx 7.  Creative tech support said battery can not be replaced, suggested I just buy a new unit.",3,1

"I got this mp3 player in June of 2012 after doing a bit of research on different mp3 players. The sound quality was great and it was easy to transfer my music files to the device. The battery life was very good, although I don't think I quite got the 51 hours of playback that it boasts. Still, the battery lasted a good long while before needing to be recharged. My initial gripe with this device was the controls--specifically, the arrow buttons on the front and the difficulty of using them. The arrow buttons required me to really exert some force to push them, which downgraded the overall user experience for me. Buttons should be easy to push.<br /><br />A few weeks ago, I totally drained the battery and the player shut down...never to power up again. It simply would not recharge no matter what I did. I tried resetting it, tried using different USB cables--everything that the manual suggested to do in the event of a charging problem, but nothing worked. It just would not charge. I could still connect it to my computer and access the files on it, but no charging would take place.<br /><br />Like my title states, it really was nice while it worked. However, considering my dislike of the buttons and the charging problem, I decided to move on to something more reliable and easy to use. See ya, iRiver!",3,2

"OK, I wasn't expecting a lot, but the light is so dim you can't the display which is what I wanted to begin with. Looks nice in kind of a late 20th century, cheap plastic, made in China sort of way and I suppose the alarm is adequate. Admittedly, I plunged ahead because of the good reviews despite the warnings of inadequate lighting for dark reading. But what hey, it was cheap, it works more or less and doesn't make any noise. What do you want for eight bucks? its OK.",3,2

Power button has to be held until the little blue light comes on then let it load it turns on it's a process from the get go. Not what I had in mind when I read about this.  A lot of the games are repeated it is cool for a child but keeping in mind the games are older Nintendo games. Good sound it is good for movie downloads and such. Nice graphics for movies the games look like the original ones with a little upgrade.,3,1
I would like this product more if the door for the cassette would close after inserting a cassette. I thinkn the door does not close due to a defect. I did not return it because it would be too much of a hassle. If not for that this product would be a 5 Stars rating.,3,2
"I bought this product because it said car specific. I was hoping it would fit into the light housing that was punched into the sheet metal in the trunk. The fit of the camera was a bit rough. Meaning, it didnt fit exactly as expected. I would assume there would be some adhesive tape on the back side of the camera so it would be held in a more secure manner but alas there wasnt any. I'm not very happy to the fit so I didnt install it at all. It's still in the box. Not sure where I am going to go from here.",3,2
"It's stylish and the quality seems good, but at full charge it won't power my iphone 4 more than 50%. It takes a while to charge up on solar even with the extra panel and takes a while to charge my phone too. Still a decent product though.",3,1

"The product looks great, clear for the visibility of the iPod colour, fits the iPod wonderfully, but seems a little thin. I bought my boyfriend the iPod for his birthday, and wanted to get a case for it because it was so thin and fragile looking. I would of liked this case to be a little thicker, to withstand more damage, because one swift drop and we could possibly have a broken iPod here. My iPod is in a case and I've dropped it multiple times, but my case is a lot thicker. I understand the company is trying to maintain sleekness, but protection shouldn't fall to the way side for something aesthetically more pleasing.",3,1

"When I read the reviews where people said they were transfering songs within minutes of starting and that they put in a tape and came back in an hour with all songs in Itunes I was sold.  Later I realized that the rewiews were 4 years old.  Must have been a dig=fferent model than the one I received.  Some reviews said the unit would automatically flip the tape but you had to shut it off because it would not recognize when the tape was finished.<br />I read the warning on the included disk and went on their web page to download the software for Win. 7, 32/64 bit and loaded it with no problems.  Hooked up the tape and started the tape to set volume levels.  Hit record and restarted tape, when tape got to end of first track it shut off.  ? How do I record the flip side?  No instructions on what to do.  I entered track titles, artist and album info clicked on finish and turned the tape over to start recording the other side.  Tape stoped at end and I repeated the proceedure.  Software would not accept same album name and entered 2 at end.  Went looking for songs in Itunes 11.1.4.62 and finally found them in &#34;recently added playlist&#34; without artist of album information.  Songs were rearanged in alphabetic order so will not play in same order as tape.  Songs were also stored in two folders instead of one.  Oh yes, songs were also converted to .WAV instead of mp3 so if you plan on playing them on anything other than an apple device you will have to convert them to mp3.  Bottom line, the unit has good sound, no noise reduction ability, and does not work as advertised.  If you don't mind the hassel of transfering the songs. dont mind the &#34;tape noise&#34; and are only going to play songs on an apple device, then it will do the job.  Some people recommend using Audacity software but I have not tried that.  From what I have read, the Audacity software is an involved process.  Would I recommend the Ion Tape Express?  If you only want to transfer one or two cassettes, it works ok,  If you want to transfer 80 some odd tapes like I do, try something else.it works ok,  If you want to transfer 80 some odd tapes like I do, try something else.",3,2
"Since the ipod has been discontinued, there is little available in protection. I had a silicon case for my gen 4  ipod which I found to be better. This silicon case is fine, fits fairly well. There is no little bottom silicone tab to protect the cable input as there was with the gen4. The screen protector comes with a cute cleaning cloth, but when i pulled the tabs off, they tore and left residue, so that I gave up on it.  This may have to do with the adhesive aging. I may still clean it off with lighter fluid and apply it, but the quality of it was not impressive. It did not leave any residue on the screen as some have stated. I much preferred the hard plastic protector that came with the gen 4.",3,1

"I already had a bluetooth speaker that I liked, but the battery on it was getting a little questionable, and the recharging light wasn't ever going off, so when I saw on LifeHacker that there was a promo code (at the time) to drop the price down to $10, I tried ordering two, but found out that it only works on one product (should have known). It's not a terrible speaker.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Decent look<br />-Gets really loud<br />-The voice of &#34;Mamma&#34; from the Ubisoft game series narrates the features on this device<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Sound quality isn't great, yeah it gets loud, but there is an odd emptiness to the sound, can't explain it, it is far from bad. For me there is way too much bass and not enough treble. For the price it's very good.<br />-Build quality (I guess for the price is fine) isn't great and the back subwoofer is installed crookedly, doubt that messes with sound quality too much, but you get what you paid for. Also the rubber strap still had some excess material that didn't get sheared off, not terrible. It really isn't terrible.<br />- The rubber feet on uneven surface is ever so slightly wobbly. Also they don't really make contact with a flat surface since there is a weird bulge in between them where the speaker bumps out on the bottom. You can tell that it's a normal build thing for aesthetics.So the feet are kind of useless (even with the plastic removed), but they do feel grippy if they were to be functional.<br />-So pressing the &#34;+&#34; skips the song, but you have to hold down &#34;+&#34; to turn up the volume, kind of backwards thinking there.<br />-The NFC is really hit or miss, but it is definitely there, so there is that.<br /><br />Is this going to replace a more expensive speaker, no, but for the money, it's pretty good. Too much bass, but some people like that, my music is more treble than bass so I don't love that feature.",3,2

"I bought this accessory set to protect my new 80 gb ipod. The accessory group was very low priced compared to other options I could see on amazon.  And overall, I am happy with the purchase.   The screen protector is decent.  The protection on the back of the ipod is pretty good.  My last ipod had a lot of scratches on the back within 6-8 months of use.  If you have the silicon case on all the time, then there is not a lot of value to it.  The layer for the front of the ipod is ok.  It took a little effort to put it on and does not fit as good as I would have hoped.  Since it is a single layer and the screen of the ipod is a couple of mm deeper then the other layer, you can see some airpockets there.  I did not try to put on the click wheel layer.    Silicon case - It fits pretty good.  However getting the ipod in and out of the pocket, it sometimes gets off.  I also had some issues with plugging my iPOD to the Bose Sounddock with the skin on. Had to take it out of the skin while plugging it in.  The click wheel also did not respond as well with the skin on.  I guess that was expected.    Armband - The armband attaches to a layer in the skin.  Did not find this to be very durable.    All in all a good buy.  Would really give it a 3 1/2 primarily because of the armband and the small issue with the front screen protection.",3,1
"This product is almost exactly in the middle of the road for me, but probably would really frustrate most customers. The FM transmission is great. I have very little trouble getting a clear signal, the Auto-tuning feature does not work. In fact, none of the buttons work except for the knob turning to find a new station. The forward/backward/play/pause buttons do nothing (and it really doesn't matter to me, but the forward button is pointing the same direction as the backward). Pairing with the Bluetooth is easy and connects very well; however, the volume is not adjustable like it should be according to the instructions that came with it. The handsfree requires you to speak up quite a bit and enunciate quite articulately, but other than making you speak better, it's not too bad. Charger works great and the patch cord for the audio works perfectly. The body stays well mounted in my 2006 Ford Ranger power port, but would have some difficulty in some older vehicles' cigarette lighter sockets (i.e. 1997 Buick LeSabre).<br /><br />Ultimately, I got everything that I wanted which is an FM transmitter and car charger that can adapt to items other than an I-pod or other proprietary connection device and the ability to have hands free. If I were expecting to use the other features (Auto-tuning, Bluetooth controls, volume control, etc.), I would be very disappointed. I plan on contacting the company to see if I can get a replacement that has controls that work, just to see if they are good.",3,1
The color in the picture was totally different then what the color was when we received it.  Other then that it has been great!,3,1

Nice very pretty,3,1
"At first I was really happy with the case. Now, only having it for two months is it broken. The magnets are so strong (which was great), now come out of their lace every time I open the case. After repeatly having to place them back into their slots, like surgery, the plastic has broken. I'm not sure this should happen so quickly.",3,1

"This is a review of the awesome little MP3 player that might have been. I love this little player... okay, I COULD love this player. I really didn't expect this review to be a gripe session, but unfortunately this player isn't what it could be. <br /> <br />I specifically wanted an MP3 player that would work with SD cards because they are inexpensive and reusable should my MP3 player ever become unusable. I almost bought a 4 Gig SD card for this but 2 GIGABYTES IS THE LIMIT. This limitation is unfortunate, but not a deal killer.  <br /> <br />The sound is great, especially on the \\""Rock\\"" equalizer setting. I would have thougth Jazz or Live might be better, but to my ears and my wife's ears all of the settings but Rock sounded a bit tinny. Again, so far so good. <br /> <br />This leads me to this player's first fatal flaw: You can't save any of the settings. Another reviewer said that this only matters for books. Wrong! EVERY TIME you turn it on you have to set the Equalizer (unless you like the tinny standard setting), then you have to set the song you want to start on (because believe me, you WILL get sick of the first 10 songs in the list). This is a bigger problem than it sounds like, because the player shuts off after only a couple of minutes. Answer the phone, set the settings. Get a drink of water, set the settings. Bio break, set the settings. You get the idea. It's excruciating. <br /> <br />And you know that big disk in the center that you see in the photos that you obviously use to switch songs? It's just decoration. That little tiny \\""nib\\"" in the center is a \\""joystick\\"" that you use to select settings/songs. It is a delicate operation that will make you stop what you are doing in order to tend to your player. Definitely not a one-handed operation. I tend to use the tip of my fingernail because it's just too easy to select the wrong thing because pressing down on the joystick is the select button. <br /> <br />But wait, it gets worse. If the player EVER touches ANYTHING it suddenly loses its mind and says \\""no card.\\"" The only recovery from this situation is to shut off the player, REMOVE THE CARD, re-insert it (carefully because other reviewers said it wears out) and--you guessed it--set the settings again. I can't imagine that the person who said it was good for working out has ever actually tried it. I got a \\""no card\\"" within 30 seconds. <br /> <br />Again, I really wanted to like this player. As it is I think I'm going to hook it up to a Sonic Impact T-Amp and a power supply so that I can leave it on FOREVER so that I don't have to set the settings every time I want to listen to a song. <br /> <br />Finally, the shuffle function doesn't work. It repeats the same songs just a few songs apart, and if you ever skip forward to a new song and go one too far (\\""oh, I like that one...\\"") if you press the back button it's just a random song, not the one you just saw. <br /> <br />If this player didn't have an unreliable SD card slot, if it could handle cards greater than 2 Gig, if it saved settings and had a real shuffle function, it would be great. As it is it's just not worth the trouble.",3,1
"I purchased this because of it's cute design and price. I like it for it's durability. However, there are 2 drawbacks. First, the stand is very flimsy and I am almost afraid to use it. Also I keep my ipod in a case that you pull it out of. Because of this, everytime I pull it out, the case comes undone.<br /><br />Other than that, it is very durable!",3,1

Esta grabadora tiene sus pros y sus contras.<br />Pros:<br />1) Maneja perfectamente el formato MP3. Y la calidad del sonido es excelente. Igual el ecualizador.<br />Contra:<br />2)Es demasiado fragil.<br />2) Los acabados de plastico son muy regulares.,3,1
"When received it was a Different style from the picture shown on picture. But keeped it anyway.<br />Just cuz I need it, right away!!!.",3,1
"Good quality, but little large to my Garmin 265WT. I used foam to adjuste that.",3,1
"You get what you pay for. My wife wanted a portable CD/FM unit to take out in the garden.  This will do that, however FM reception is weak and sound quality is very basic, OK for voice, not so good for music.",3,2
"This is the second one of these I have purchased, simply because the price is right.  Sometimes they work well, but it really depends on the radio frequency you choose, your location (you might have to change frequencies as you drive), and the position and orientation of your ipod.  Someitmes it works well in the passenger seat or center console, and you have to rotate your ipod around, but often there is static (sometimes a LOT!).  Another complaint is that if you use a case for your ipod (and who doesn't?) this will not work, as the connector is too short, the body of this device hits the case, so you can't get it to plug in all the way.  I take my plastic ipod case to a belt sander and file down the edges, but not everyone has the tools/skill to do this.  The connector really should stick out just a little (1/16\\"") further.  Oh, well, for the price, you're not out much if you don't like it.  The ones that plug into your cig lighter have better sound quality with less static, but pricier.",3,1
"Overall it is a decent product. The price is reasonable compared to the Tom Tom version. The material seems sturdy and of good quality. The suction cup works very well.   This mount does have some downsides. The bracket doesn't snap into the back of my 730go very well. But it hasn't caused a problem. On bumpy roads it bounces a bit more than I like. If I rest the flexible part on the dash it helps.   Again, overall this is a good value for the price.",3,1
Daughter loved it because she has older media that she can listen to again.,3,1
"Sturdy, well-built and well-priced.  Having a remote is great.  But the bass emphasis really distorts the music.  When listening to bass-heavy pop/rock, I don't mind.  When listening to jazz, acoustic or classical, it's really distracting. <br /> <br />I hope they release a future version that works as an alarm clock (with snooze button) and as a dock for synching.  (It will charge the iPod, but there's no way to connect it to my computer so I can synch with iTunes.)",3,1
"[[ASIN:B0067XVNTG Car DashBoard Video Camera Vehicle Video Accident Recorder DVR - 1080P Full HD Resolution Video, 2.0\\"" LCD Display]]<br /><br />Don't be fooled by this camera's claim to record \\""Full HD video\\"".  This is technically correct in terms of pixels, but the video quality is nowhere near HD.<br /><br />The video this camera records has a RESOLUTION of 1920x1080, but the QUALITY of the video is barely on par with standard definition video.  This is an important distinction, because in other words, it has the same number of pixels as HD video, but it looks like standard definition video blown up to HD size.  It doesn't have the clarity or detail of true HD.  This also means it wastes space on your card capturing 1920x1080 HD video when you could get the same quality from 640x480 SD.<br /><br />The video is also not very smooth.  The speed is inconsistent and the framerate is low, which makes it more likely for important details, such as license plates, to be obscured by motion blur.  My standard for dash cams is: If I can't read a license plate on camera that I could read from the driver's seat, it isn't good enough.  The wide-angle lens also contributes to this problem, as it makes objects 30 feet away look like they're 100 feet or more in the distance.  This makes it difficult to get a feel for the speed and flow of traffic around you when watching the video.<br /><br />For someone looking for a cheap, \\""set and forget\\"" solution to have a video record of accidents, this is probably sufficient.  If you get cut off by a speeding drunk driver and look at the video to report their license plate to the cops, you probably won't be able to read it.  If you're like me, and looking for a versatile HD solution to capture every detail of your road trips - look elsewhere.<br /><br />UPDATE:  After doing some research, I found that in the great state of California it's illegal to use suction cup mounts on your windshield.  This renders the camera totally useless, since I could not find another way to mount it.  (I won't put it on my dash, too visible for thieves.)  All things considered, this camera was not worth my money, and I will be returning it.could not find another way to mount it.  (I won't put it on my dash, too visible for thieves.)

"The color and ease of putting this on were great, we were just hoping for a little protection on the front of the unit, but I guess it doesn't really show that, all it all, it's just as the picture shows and very easy to put on, unlike some of the other Ipod covers!",3,1
"The camera works ok as was expected, but I also expected to connect it to my computer via the USB cord provided. However, I tried it on several different computers and they all say that the hardware is unsupported. I thought the drivers were on the camera as there wasn't an installation CD inside the package but I was wrong. It is a hassle to return it so I'm stuck with it until I find a better one. If it had an A/V output it would be a better buy also.",3,2
"The case is well built and would have been a better value had it actually been the correct size the GPS unit. It's a bit big for the 3100.  It actually is quite serviceable for my touch screen tablet, so in that respect it was a win for me.",3,1

"There is another set of reviews for the same product in Amazon; that one is more expensive at this moment.  Search for iP915 to find it.  There are also user comments online at Walmart's website.    Why \\""mixed blessings\\""?  Some features are really nice, especially for the money, other things are at least annoying.    Pros:  +  Price - I bought it at an electronics store on close out for a few dollars LESS than an Apple branded iPhone charging stand.  +  Sound quality - very good for a small box.  A bit boomy for talking voices, but OK otherwise.   +  It is heavily constructed with a real veneer wood outside.  It has sturdy metal feet with rubber inserts that won't scratch furniture.  +  It has a true stereo: each side with a 2-way speaker system with rear vented port.  The black cloth speaker grills are removable just like real speakers.  +  The clock has a dimmer feature, including off, and at full intensity is readable in daylight but not blinding at night.  +  It comes with three different plastic holders to fit different iPod models.  +  Has a 3.5mm stereo input labeled MP3, and a decent FM tuner, 30 presets.  You have to jack in and hang a long black wire antenna to get good reception.  +  Charges my iPhone 3GS when docked.  +  Plays music from iPhone in iPOD mode, as well as the MP3 input and FM.    Cons:  -  Some features don't work right with an iPhone.  My fault for not making that distinction when looking at the box - but \\""Universal\\"" isn't - deduct a star.  I have a 3GS 32GB model, and it complains about incompatibility when docked and wants to turn off the phone (airplane mode) to \\""prevent interference\\"".  This is bogus.  The phone works just fine when it is plugged in, bluetooth included, and I don't hear any extra buzzes pops or whines that would be typical of radio interference (I had a desk speakerphone that used to make all sorts of odd noises when my cell phone/PDA was nearby).  HEY APPLE - STOP WITH THE INCOMPATIBLE/LAZY PROGRAMMING!  I'm much moreannoyed with Apple for sloppy programming in the iPhone, rather than Koda.  If the phone can detect that it is talking to an older style interface, then why doesn't it just adjust accordingly and use lesser features instead of arrogantly giving up and not working?  BAD USER EXPERINCE, APPLE!!!!     The things that don't work right are the Menu, navigation arrows and Enter on the remote - they don't do anything.  The play/pause and fwd/rev buttons work OK.  It mutes the music when the phone is active, just like it should.  The volume and tone controls don't affect the iPhone and also work fine (or as fine as this type of remote will)  -  The 3 buttons on top are nice and solid feeling, but they only control On/Off and Volume Up/Down.  Everything else requires the cheezy remote.  This cost one more star - really, they should have had at least an Input selector button.  -  As others have noted, the tiny bubble membrane remote feels delicate and the unit is crippled without it.  Be very gentle...  -  Min volume still pretty loud - coarse volume adjustments at low end.  -  24 hour time only.  No AM/PM in the LCD screen, so it couldn't show it anyway.  -  It randomly turns on the iPhone and plays the iPOD selected album.  The LCD screen appears to have two alarm indicators per the manual, but there is no way to control them that I can figure out; no mention in the user guide.  Perhaps that is linked into features of some iPODs, but the iPhone isn't one of them.  -  Given the last two notes above, I wouldn't really call this a \\""clock radio\\"".  Yes it has a radio and a clock and a dock, but they aren't integrated at all, at least with an iPhone.  Perhaps someone with a \\""supported\\"" iPod will comment further on these details.  -  When ON, the backlight for the three buttons on top is really bright white, which rather negates the good illumination control on the front LCD.    One other reviewer noted that his unit hung up when setting the clock.  I had the same issue with thisone.  I cleared it by unplugging it AND taking the batteries out of the bottom (2 x AA, not included) and letting it sit for a bit.  Put it back together, double checked the battery polarity, and it worked OK after that.    The bottom line is that I'm disappointed by the promise of the things that might have worked but don't, a bit scared of the remote's vulnerability, but delighted by the sound at this price.  This was once at least an $80 unit, and would be easily worth that or more if it just had an Input button on the case,  iPhone support and some attention to details like AM/PM, alarms.  Still, this is WAY better as it sits with all its flaws than a stupid dumb plain no sound Apple charging dock for MORE money.  I'm NOT taking it back for a refund, and if the remote dies and it is in a useless input state, then I'll use it for just the clock and the charging dock until I can figure out a way to use the nice case and speakers some other way...   Hmmm...  Maybe I should look into a learing remote to capture this one before it dies...",3,2
All the items in the bundle are great. I just did not end up needing 90% of the items.,3,1
"I read all the negative reviews and I really think people are expecting way too much. First of all, let me start by saying this thing is ONLY $5. In today's world $5 isn't very much at all. For what this product does (if you have one that was manufactured properly) it is well worth $5. The aux audio cable sound is fine in my car, and so is the USB audio. I think a lot of the problem people are having is that they need to find a more dead station with less interference then the ones they are using. Yes, this thing is manufactured by very cheap Chinese standards. However, you know what to expect when buying anything made in China. For five bucks you really can't beat this thing if you have an old car, though. Great audio, works fine as it's advertised, just be careful with it.",3,1
"I purchased this item from DB Roth and previously gave 2 stars because it was not compatible with 3GS phone.  DB Roth contacted me immediately and offered full refund to resolve my dissatisfaction, noting that they had mistakenly listed it as 3GS compatible.  Both the wall and car chargers as well as the USB cables work great with my iPod, and with the early 3G phone.  While the product is a very good deal for these devices, what really impressed me is DB Roth's real commitment to customer satisfaction!

"I bought this iPod Nano case for my 17-year-old son. He was very happy with it, since he was having difficulty finding a case that provided easy access to the controls and didn't hide the color of his Nano. I've only given it 3 stars, since the belt clip broke off after a couple of months of use, but my son still prefers the case without the clip to other options.",3,1
"Got these to use while running because earbuds hurt my ears and fall out all the time no matter what size they are. At first they were great, but now, after about 7 mo the sound in one ear has a buzz to it. They sometimes bounce off my ears while I'm running, but because they are wire, I can bend them so they hold tight again. Wish there were more options on the market for people who can't wear earbuds.",3,1
Power buttons tend to get easily pushed by the firmness of the case putting pressure on it. Go for the softer cases (not silicone) or the harder cases which don't cover the buttons.,3,2
"I have a 2005 Prius that is bulletproof (literally gas, oil and tires is all that has been needed in 175k miles...even still riding the og brakes!) but I love me some A2DP that my wife's car has...so I run the  cassette + line out to my Android device, but I hate cords.  Finally a Bluetooth solution!<br /><br />As others have said there has to be a job in China for an English editor (WTF &#34;agreements&#34; might as well say &#34;handshake&#34; or just say pairing).  Anyway, any fool who has owned at least 2 Bluetooth devices in their lives should get it to work properly.  This is one of those that requires you hold for 7 secs and then the indicator flashes blue/red intermittently to indicate that it is in pairing mode.  My Note 3 found it easily and it was at least labelled &#34;Adapsonic&#34; which is nice.  I did not have to re-pair the device once I had it paired (per other reviews this appears to be an issue).  Volume seemed fine (radio was slightly louder than Slacker when I was streaming via Bluetooth, but not a glaring difference).  Didn't try the mic. but I prefer a wired headset in the car especially because I make money on my phone and BT is crap with all the ambient noise in a car.<br /><br />Now for the bad...as with all these damn cassette adapters, they insist on putting in these cheap ass wheels that are inapposite...there is no tape to spin or drag across the tape deck...so why put them in??? They just make useless and annoying noise!!!  I went through about 3 wired brands until I settled on the Phillips (which ironically is one of the cheapest) but has the least rolling noise.  I am tempted to unscrew the thing and remove the wheels and see if that works.  It is clearly the wheels that make the noice as they are very loosely installed and shift around alot.  I am going to play around with the unit to see about battery life to see if I want to risk losing the return option.  One bummer is that you cannot charge the cassette while it is in the deck...so one more thing to haul in at night to charge...have to see how often.",3,2
"When the Nook Tablet allows you to load the NR Card on restart it works great, but the Tablet eventually reboots itself back to the Nook format without prompting. The company was very helpful on trying to fix all the problems but the software updates that the Nook uses causes all kinds of rooting problems. I still use the card but I have to restart my tablet (sometimes more than once) to get the android screen, and am always prepared to be booted out at any given time so I don't get too frustrated with it. Just plugging it into the charger or putting it to sleep or browsing the web can reboot it...other times it stays loaded for a whole day.",3,1
This case fits well and protects the device nicely. However the color turns from lime green to tan green quickly and cannot be cleaned,3,1
"Shipping was very fast on this item, and I received it before I expected to. The cable I received doesn't seem to be an Apple cable, but it works so far and is not cheaply made like other generic cords I have seen. I am definitely satisfied with my purchase so far, it is a good product for the price.",3,1
great product and produces very good sound except that the battery life on this little thing sucks! other than that I would have given it a better rating as it produces a good sound for its size.,3,1
I like to use it but I wish that it would have its own charger. Otherwise it's great and looks nice.,3,1
Works fine but shipping time was very slow.,3,1
plug that goes into phone is very hard to get out and i am scared it will ruin my phone so i dont use it,3,2
"Nice and convenient, but you have to place I-Pod3 in and a certain way and then verify it is charging.  So, it's a little finicky on that angle, but the overall convenience makes up for it.  The seller is great, fassssst shipping.",3,1
Works OK as advertised for cassette tapes BUT to convert  LP's you need an ION Record deck or one with a pre amp.<br />You cannot it appears convert using your own  stand alone record deck  . Otherwise OK.,3,1
The one speaker is broke waiting for replacement sounds good easy to install,3,1
"The product looks great after installation (looks almost the same as the W166 DRL) but the path is uneasy.<br /><br />Wrong model was sent but it came out fast turnaround to replace the DRL. You need to spend time to investigate the installation procedure w/o any installation guide. The DRL is not perfect fit/ plug-n-play work. It involved unloading the bumper, modification / seesaw work of the original fog light plastic mounts before you can fit in the DRL. Seems not DIY possible.",3,1
This case is nice - but I did not receive the same case as pictured - I purchased the Purple case and the color was not the same - did not have the logo on the front of the case - was disappointed that the style was not the same as pictured - this should be listed in the product description or the pics should be updated with the most recent version if the case is changed by the manufacturer.   Other than this the case fits the 4th and 5th generation Nano's great - it holds my Nano securely and the controls are easy to access.   Overall I gave the item 3 stars due to the difference in the item and the pictures/description.,3,2
For the price this is a good device for any mp3 player. My only complaint is that on my Sansa Clip version I can not charge and play at the same time. Works great if all I do is try to play it which is what I really bought it for so I'm keeping it. To charge when I get somewhere I just plug in the usb and by the time I get back to the truck it's fully charged.,3,1
I received it as A gift.. so far I like it but I don't know how to use it to its full potential. It didn't come with well detailed instructions. Just basic get it started instructions.,3,1
"I bought this for an iPhone 5S and received it quickly from a Prime eligible vendor. This cable is very long, and I was anxious to have it work out. I was pleased to find that the lightning tip did work with my OtterBox. Unfortunately, it failed after three charges. The cable is noticeably thinner then either my original Apple or an Amazon basics cable and that may be the reason that Ismooth says they no longer carry it.<br /><br />I notified the customer service department at Ismooth the day it failed, and they quickly agreed to ship me a replacement. Since they no longer carry the 3m cord, I have to settle for a 2m one. I have not received it as yet, but will provide an update if/when I do.<br /><br />While I can't endorse the product, I was pleased with the level of customer service, thus the three star rating.",3,1
"Edit: mine started charging again (not sure why it ever stopped), and so, because of the excellent radio and good sound quality, I'm bumping this to 3 stars.<br /><br />This is my review for the [[ASIN:B00RJW5U02 green 16GB version]], which is identical to this aside from the color and the micro SD card size. If you do buy one, look at the various colors and 16GB vs 8GB offerings to see what your best pricing option is that day - they fluctuate.<br /><br />I wanted to like this. I too owned the iPod nano this is so clearly meant to replicate. I was offered a free sample for evaluation, and I was excited to get it. I've spent many weeks trying to decide if I should evaluate it, but I've been pushed to do so by Charles Spanky's brave 1-star review (on the green 16GB version) as well as my brother's much higher four-star rating (likewise, for that color). Plus... I'm just tired of the need to review it hanging over my head.<br /><br />So... why two stars instead of the one that Charles gave?<br /><br />Because this item does have some nice aspects to it. You get a 16GB micro SD card, a mini USB cable (useful for 15 year old devices you find in drawers, perhaps), earbuds (low quality, but serviceable), and a fun little puzzle (&#34;how to I get this darned thing to work?&#34;). You also get a surprisingly decent audio recorder and an FM radio that actually sounds fantastic with better headphones plugged in. Music sounds really good as well. I mean, truly, genuinely good. I wasn't expecting that.<br /><br />So, why two stars instead of the four my brother gave?<br /><br />Because I fear that rating it higher would kill the little that remains of my soul. This just isn't, in my opinion, a four star device, even at $25. Maybe it's worth half that... maybe it's a four-star $12.50 device, because then you could part it out upon its death and recoup your expenses. Maybe.<br /><br />But... look, I love tech. I love love love love tech. I have more phones than fingers. I get giddy around anything mechanical or that consumes (or generates) power. I'm excited by this sort of stuff usually, even the low-end things. But I just cannot stand this one. The button-circle-control thingy is *horribly* inaccurate/laggy/inconsistent. The movie player only plays movie formats that no one living has except maybe on a PC from 1994 somewhere in their basement. Ebooks? Um, no. Even if you could manage to get one on-screen, the control pad would make reading it unbearable. Music plays great... but the 1999 folder scheme has been out of date since the first iPod and is - again - near useless when using the control pad to navigate it.<br /><br />Worst of all: the thing died on me. I let it run out of charge, and now it cannot be used when not plugged in. It simply will not hold a charge for even a second's worth of playing - it's like there is no battery at all. I've tried charging at 500mA, at 1A, and at 2A. Nothing. So, as little as this was worth as a $25 device, it's worth less as a $25-plus-external-battery device.<br /><br />If it played movies in formats known to modern humans, I'd rate it higher. If the directory structure made finding music easier, I'd rate it higher. If the control pad worked well, or if it used micro USB, or if it didn't die after going uncharged for a few days, or if it came with a 64GB micro SD card, I'd rate it higher. As it is, I just can't.<br /><br />You want something better? New prepaid cellphones are often near this price and will perform so much better. Not long ago, the nice-for-the-price now-discontinued [[ASIN:B00E45043A Nokia 520]] was $20. The fantastic [[ASIN:B00HPP3QD6 Moto G]] has been as low as $25. I own both of these, and they ABSOLUTELY BLOW THIS OUT OF THE WATER and can do everything this can (except the Moto G doesn't use a micro SD card).<br /><br />Look around at prepaid cellphones.

"IT DIDN'T FIT MY IPOD FROM 3 YEARS AGO, MAYBE IT FITS THE NEW IPOD, IT'S A SHAME THAT APPLE PRODUCTS BECOME OBSOLETE AND MAYBE THAT'S WHY IT DIDN'T FIT. THE DESIGN WAS REALLY COOL, I GAVE IT AWAY.",3,2
"No doubt it has great suction, but I've already encountered a short in the hose/switch connection after less than one year.  Time to repair or replace the part.",3,1
"I received the Muse quickly and promptly well packaged and easy to open. I had bought this unit for a friend who is not terribly technologically adept but he had seen how I use my phone to play music from Prime and from internet radio and was interested so I thought it would be a good idea to try it out before I gave it to him. It appears that the instructions which are obviously not native language to the writer, are inconsistent with the way this unit works. I kept looking for an alternate flashing red and blue light to indicate the unit was ready to be paired. As per instructions I charged the unit for aprox five hours before the first use. I tried repeatedly to pair the unit with my phone but could not. I gave up for a moment, and then wrote an email to Aukey Support to see if possibly there was something I over looked. After sending the email, I decided to try to pair the unit one more time. This time it worked. And the next day when my friend came over for me to give him the unit, we were able to successfully pair the unit with his phone. I did not hear from Aukey Support until several days later when they apologized for the delay as they do not work on weekends. They said some instructions from different units are slightly different and that they would correct the manual the next time around. Again, the person writing to me was obviously not writing in her native language as it was written as if translated by google. As far as ease of operation and sound, well I bought the unit on sale, and I bought it for a friend whom I was not sure would use it, figuring down the line if he really liked it perhaps he could upgrade to a more expensive or higher grade Bluetooth speaker. For the price the unit is easy to use, and the sound is quite good for the size. Not a lot of bass, but there is some, and so far as I used it, it doesn't seem to distort when turned up even with heavy classical music although pop sounds best on it. I ultimately gave it only three stars because of my experience with pairing the unit and difficulty of communicating with Aukey Support.se of my experience with pairing the unit and difficulty of communicating with Aukey Support.",3,1
"It looks nice, but I don't get as good reception than I did with my stock antenna.  Oh well, who listens to the radio anymore anyway, right?",3,1
"As others, I was impressed with the video quality during light hours.<br /> However, the lever that lifts the suction broke off on the second use. Thanks to Amazon return policy, I've replaced this cam with another model.<br />Pluses:<br />- No need for any software;<br />- The unit uses Windows .avi files, which is very convenient;<br />- USB connection allows uploading the data to a computer without removing the cam or the memory card;<br />- The battery is removable.<br /><br />Minuses:<br />- Poor mount;<br />- The cam is relatively heavy for mounting on the windshield;<br />- The lens can be tilted to only a very limited angle. In fact, it is basically a two-position deal, as the lens would not stay in any intermediate position. It limits the positioning of the cam on the windshield.<br />Overall, it is a good camera but be aware of the suction mount and limited angle. It does not appear to be strong enough for this camera.",3,2
Love the idea and I use it daily. But if it fit the iPad in the portrait layout it would be nicer,3,1

"This looks good and definitely will protect the NUVI.  There's even a mesh pocket inside that helps keep it in place.  The zipper is the weak point.  It frequently fails to catch and stays opened on both sides of the slider.  Sometimes it takes a few attempts but it always does, finally, catch and close.  When it does close, properly, it stays closed.  Overall, worth the price.",3,1
did not arrive on time but over all for the price of a protection plan that is 3 years it is well worth it,3,1
"I bought this product as a spare to use in my waterproof case for when I swim laps.  This product is a little bigger than the Ipod 2nd gen shuffle and will not fit in waterproof case.  Since it was of no use to me I gave it to my son, he likes it because he can download his music and listen when he runs.    However seller should put some info saying that this product will not work with any Ipod products.  This products looks exactly like the Ipod Shuffle and I mistakely bought it thinking it was the 2nd generation Ipod shuffle.",3,1
The heads themselves will last long enough (4-6 days) and give a decent vapor depending upon which juice you are using. But search the internet as far as pricing. I just got a 10 pack of these exact same things for $17.00 and that's with shipping,3,1
"At first I thought that having 2 chargers is overkill. But I found that the battery charge dissipates if left uncharged for about 36 hours, even if they are turned off. Problem was - one of the chargers didn't work, but they were fairly quick to send a new charger. And when it is dead, it loses the date and time. Which brings me to the second problem - the date and time are really difficult to set. When you finally get the buttons pressed just right and you see the hour start to blink to set the time, don't hesitate because it only waits a little while then goes back to unset mode. As for the 2 way radio, it's not too bad, for the price. Reception is sometimes choppy and distorted, especially if my child goes around the other side of a brick house just across the street. Works best if there is a direct line of sight between them, but in that case you probably don't need a walkie-talkie.",3,2
"I like this, but its not as great as I had hoped. It seems to work perfectly from my end as long as I am not in a major city with lots of radio stations, but here Phoenix there are so many stations that you can't get a good clear spot on the dial that isn't picking up some interference from an adjoining station.  It still works, but as you drive about and one signal gets stronger it starts to override your signal from the Transmitter and you end up having to switch stations and frequencies which mean you need to pull off the road to make the adjustments.  Also I get complaints from the people I am talking to that there is some kind of feedback that comes through on their end that makes it difficult to understand me.  However if I am out in a more rural area with few FM stations about the unit works as it should and calls are crisp and clear and none of the people I am talking to complain of background interference.",3,1
"The item came with a banded cover, but worse of all the protector does not fit the PRS-T1 screen not matter how I apply to the surface. Avoid this brand as much as possible.  UPDATE 1/12/12:  I got a refund after filing a claim. They probably sent the wrong item to me. So my review might not be an accurate reflection of the actual product.",3,2
"Wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this.  Am disappointed that the cover only softens glare and does not dim it at all. You'll still see light reflections...they're just not as sharp.  As other reviews say, anti-glare distorts the display.  This cover produces a distracting, almost rainbow distortion on white-background book pages.  Fonts get noticeably blurrier and fuzzy.  If you appreciate the great crispness of the Kindle Fire's display, don't add this to it.  Maybe the clear version is better if protection is all you want.  Installation is a little tricky...watch the video closely.  Can't quite tell whether the 1st plastic membrane peeled away (Tab 1) is above or below the cover it self, since everything is transparent.  Turns out Tab 1 is being peeled away from the bottom side of the cover.  Otherwise seems the quality of this company's products are decent...don't mean to reflect badly on that at all.",3,2
"I bought this just as a protection for my Nook STR.<br /><br />The colour of the case is exactly as shown in the photos, and the case itself seems sturdy enough to carry my Nook in my purse/bag without worrying about any damage. It is a perfect fit and the Nook stays snugly in the elastic straps.<br /><br />The Skin Decal is a sticker, which looked very enticing in the snap, but does not hold any allure for me now. Maybe I should have taken another one. Otherwise, its a nice picture, and the sticker fits perfectly front and back. I was expecting a silicon skin.<br /><br />Haven't used the screen protector, because apparently Nook STR doesn't need one. I'm also expecting the case to protect the screen.",3,1
"I know exactly what the previous reviewer means. I have an iRoc installed in my 2002 Mercedes SLK and it will be a sad day when I have to uninstall it. The iRoc is great! It's a single DIN that adds iPhone charging and visual navigation to my very small cabin without wires. I installed it myself, no less. I've stayed on my iPhone 4S for a year now waiting on a path forward. At this point I'd eat the cost and buy a whole new unit if it was offered. But for the past year the news from Jackson Electronics on their roadmap for Lightning connectors is loud crickets.<br />At some point, I will have to assume that no follow-on product is planned, and replace my beloved iRoc.",3,1

"I have now had this unit installed for over 4 months and am in the process of removing it for the third time.  The first time was due to a malfunction with the CD/DVD drive which was promptly repaired under warranty after I finally got them to provide me with the necessary info as to where to send it.  The second time was to install the XM radio receiver (the model number was provided by Kenwood customer service) and this last time is to remove the XM receiver since it was in fact the incorrect model number.  I really like the unit, but I have no faith in their customer service and I have spent as much time taking the unit in and out as I have using it.  If you need information for warranty repair or accessories it seems this part of the product equation they can't get right.",3,1
"The sound is low, I will keep it anyway, I like it, but my brother doesn't.",3,1
"I bought this as a second arm band case for when I can't find my Belkin. The main problem with this case is that the band is too big around. No matter how tightly, I try to fasten it, it eventually comes undone. It works okay, haven't to refasten it over and over just gets old.",3,2
"It fits well in my 08 GT. I'm not sure if it is really a flaw or not, but the box rolled on the subwoofers' face a couple times when driving. Nothing a hideous rope couldn't fix (no you can't drill it into the car). As far as sound goes, it is alright for a sealed box. I wasn't expecting much since I couldn't find any ported boxes for my car. However, the sound is tight and clean on my Alpine Type R's. Another thing I did notice with my particular subwoofers, is that the holes in the box were just a little too big. When I screwed them into the box, a couple of the screws didn't grip because they weren't hitting the wood well enough.<br /><br />Overall, it is a good product if you want something that fits well in the car and leaves you some trunk space. If you are looking for performance sound, you need twice the airspace and some ports.<br /><br />Pros: fits well<br /><br />cons: snaggy carpet, holes too big, terminals leak air, only 1 ft2 airspace, no ported version available.",3,1
I was looking for a skin to put on my Nook Tablet to help keep the frame from getting anymore scratched and came upon these bundles.  Shipping was really fast and the cover seems nice for a faux leather cover.  Just as nice as my original Barnes and Noble one but half the price.  The skin is pretty and has a nice texture and actually makes the tablet less slippery.  The thing that makes it so so is it doesn't stick around the edges.  All the outer edges are popped up a bit so it doesn't look very good.  It looks like I've had it on for weeks and I've only had it on since last night.  It definitely won't last and I'll be looking for something else.,3,1
"I would rate it 5 stars if it stayed on all the time, it turns off after a certain period of inactivity.  I would also like it better if it turned on by the power cord (USB).  If it did this I could plug it into the light switched plugs and turn it on when I walk into the room and have it automatically connect to my phone.<br /><br />Setup is simple.  Plug it into speakers, and power, (it will also run on internal battery).  Turn it on (switch on side), turn on your device Bluetooth and tell it to connect to the device.  No password required.  Once that's done my phone kept it in memory.  So any time I want to use it now I just turn the receiver on and turn on my phone's Bluetooth and it connects automatically.",3,1
"For the money, you can't beat what it does, though there are some oddities that the manufacturer needs to fix: 1. Every now and then, I get an emergency recording alert on the LCD screen when there is clearly no emergency (just normal driving). 2. Establishing a wifi connection is easy to do, but downloading video from the device to your mobile phone takes forever, not to mention the fact that you can't forward the video via email (only view it within the application). You could, of course, simply remove the SD card and copy it to your computer. 3. When viewing the recordings from the mobile app, they all showed up as unplayable on one occasion - I had to reboot the device to fix this issue.  Not sure if there is yet another firmware update needed or mobile app update.  All in all, though, it is a good product and I'm happy with it.",3,1
Good headset.,3,1
Works very well on holding the ipod but hard to get in and out of the case. I find it extremely difficult to plug in headphones while the case is on because the ipod likes to move around in the case but not much. It is enough to have troubles plugging in the head phone. Hurts my inner arm. The strap something pinches the skin. The band likes slide if not extremely tightened.,3,2
"This item was delivered to my home promptly and in good condition after I ordered it. Unfortunately, it didn't work for what I needed it for. Luckily, I know an individual that could use it so I gave it to them instead of hassling with a return and it works fine for them.<br /><br />There was nothing wrong with this connector but I needed the female 30 pin connector instead. That's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. I should have researched better before I ordered it but it still went to good use so no harm no foul.",3,2
"It really wasn't what I was expecting but, it had most everything I need, not sure I would order it again though. I felt it was a little costly<br />for what you get.",3,1
When i open the package the fm transmitter was broken. The top of it came right off. I had to assemble it back together and super glued it because it was only 4 dollar. Not worth the hassel of sending it back but was not satisfied with how i got it. It still works but has alot of static. It works but was not happy with how i got it.,3,2
The adapter was in good shape on arrival and functions properly.  I reccommend buying this product to anyone that needs an adapter.,3,1

"According to product description, the case has a \\""snap\\"" for securing iPod Touch, etc. The one that I just received, came with a magnetic snap instead of a traditional one. Does anybody see anything wrong with this picture?!?! It makes great engineering sense (and goes without saying) that a magnetic securing latch will quite possibly erase or corrupt data on any electromagnetic device such as the iPod Touch.    Note to manufacturers: Please 'think' about what your product is designed for; please learn how things work! Magnets and electronics with \\""solid-state\\"" drives are not likely to mix...",3,2
This cover does protect the Kindle adequately.  I do wish it had a feature that allows the Kindle to be propped up.  That would be helpful.  The magnet is very strong and keeps the cover closed.,3,1
"Look it works... but what do you expect for $17!  A bit hard to navigate but,  it works! I use it for my toddler's music.. if it breaks? Not concerned, cuz... it is $17, people -  and it works!

"The Ectaco Jetbook Lite is a pretty good reader, and it has several pros and cons:  Its pros are:  Easy to read screen with no distracting backlight;   Compact to carry around in a coat pocket with a 5\\"" TFT screen;  Convenient buttons and controls;   Has a dictionary and can read in several languages;   Uses 4 AA batteries - only this reader (and the Ectaco Jetbook Mini) on the market has this convenience.  You can get books from many bookstores and libraries;   Can read from more formats than many other readers - only the Aluratek Libre Pro can read more.  Its cons are:  Use a booklight to read it in a darker setting;   No audio or MP3 player;   Customer support is only fair;   But its biggest con is price -  high for what you get compared to other ereaders - much more that the Aluratek Libre Pro, which is identical in appearance and hardware (and has and audio jack to play MP3 sources) but uses different firmware.",3,1
The Kenwood is not user friendly.  It is very difficult to scroll through the settings unless you are reading the manual as you do.  It is not intuitive.  I was very frustrated that the USB doesn't read my WMA files well.  It skips folders and sometimes doesn't read the name of the folder.  It is very slow to scroll through folders to find albums.,3,2
Sort of works.,3,1
Was part of a gift.,3,1
"This case gets three stars mainly for its lower price. That was what caught my eye... well that and the fact that it's advertised as NAPA leather. It surely is not NAPA or any other sort of leather, and already has bits wearing off especially about the clasp from opening and closing it.     As another reviewer noted, this thing smells putrid. I'd say something akin to a litter of putrefied puppies dipped in a vat of raw petroleum about sums up the smell. Just wretched. After a few weeks, the smell has gone, but there's not even a faint scent of leather, not even where it has split open.     Another problem is how it holds the device... it's rare that it will slip out, but it can and has on me once within a month because I grabbed at it hastily and incorrectly. Regardless, the device should be snug in the case and not able to slip out... that's what sleeves do.     If you want an okay cover with a low price, go for it. It looks alright, but as for myself, I believe I'm going to grab a different style.",3,2
Only 1 in the package.  Though everything else I've gotten from eForCity has been what I expected or exceeded expectations.,3,1
"I received the cover for my Nook Simple Touch and am having some issues with using the back and forward buttons. It is a bit of a hard touch due to the cutout of the frame. I don't \\""need\\"" to access the buttons since I can use the touch screen feature, but I still want the option and this case creates a bit of an issue. I have some concerns about the connecting piece lasting since it is not as sturdy as I would like. I do like the pockets and the price was reasonable. If you are concerned about using the buttons to turn the pages of your Nook, you may want to check out a different style cover.",3,1
"and it's a bit difficult to reach the buttons.  But, it looks good and it does what it's supposed to do.  overall, i recommend it",3,1
"Product delivered on time.  Unfortunately, the charger was a big let down.  The USB cable does not fit my nookcolor so I'm back to square one and stuck with an item that has no real value to me - sigh.",3,2
"What I really needed was the whole bezel, home button and glass assembly. This was not it. I should have done more research concerning what I needed. If this was all I needed then it would have worked out just fine. It comes with tools but they are very cheap. The screen quality is very good.",3,1
"I bought this set for the charging cord options. The rubber/silicone cases fit the Gen 4 Ipod loosely. What I did like was the little velvet black bag. I didn't think I would use it, but I keep it in there all the time. The leather flip case is nice if your looking for a case. The charging cords and ear phones are cheap plastic, but they function perfectly. I use the ear phones all the time.",3,1
"It's okay... but even w my extra memory it only holds up to 10 songs. I'll have to buy a bigger micro card I guess. It plays good sound, and arrived in a timely manor.",3,1
"if you need protection, its great....function not so great ,they don't fit very well, when its on the key does not operate",3,1
"The first unit was bad and had to be replaced, but no problems with the replacement.  LCD on remote scratches easy so be careful",3,1

Works great,3,1
I order this case for my iPod and love it because saw the beauty of my iPod and the color,3,1
"The item did not fit my Ipod. When I received it, I noticed that it is for an Ipod that does not have camera. When I tried to put it on it was too big. I was going to return it, but the shipping cost more than the item, so I think I will donate it or do something with it.<br />The design is pretty. The quality is ok, but it won't protect it if your device falls or so. It will protect it mostly of scratches.",3,2
"I purchased Amazon prime which seems to be a real waste of money because 65% of the things I want to purchase  is not eligible for the prime advantage, including the ZVM silicone skin case so I deceided to go directly to PC microstore where I found it on sale for $11.99 (that's $6 less than Amazon's price) and free shipping to boot.  So I sugget you go directly to the site than purchasing it through Amazon.",3,1
"Seems like you get alot here, but don't be fooled.  This stuff is cheap quality - but look at the price!  You definitely get what you pay for in this case.  I was OK with the quality when compared with price but don't expect champagne on a beer budget here - it is no great deal so don't be surprised.",3,1
The patch cord fits in the I phone fine but it is a tad bit to short to connect the I phone into headphone amplifier. which makes it almost useless.,3,1
"These are super cute,  but offer very little protection. If you drop ipod it will break. They fit just fine",3,1
It works.  Picture is just ok.  Wish I could use something other than their app to access it.,3,1
I chose to rate this 3 stars because the Magnet came loose and moves around so it makes it hard to keep it closed. I love the padding that it has though. The price wasn't bad either so can't complain to much.,3,1
Good sound.  It is a pity iPhone 6 can't be used directly with it,3,1
"The cover fit OK; however, it covers up the head phone jack on the bottom which requires you to cut or push back the cover to insert the head phone jack.",3,2

There are a lot of pages to this log book which seems odd; if anyone is flying lots of hours, they probably are going to use an electronic log, and for folks just joy flying, the front cover will come off long before this is close to full.",3,1
This small folding speaker is exactly what you should expect for the price.  i wanted a small portable speaker to use when I wanted to play a song from my zune for others.  The sound quality is NOT amazing but I did not expect that for the price.  I was frustrated the sound volume was so very low even with the volume control was set at the highest possible level.  Then I figured out that I could increase the volume by increasing the volume setting on the zune itself.  So it meets my needs.  I can play children's songs to my sunday school class.  But if you are a sound expert and want to increase the treble or bass to your liking this is not for you.,3,1
"Good product, however there are only a few fm stations to output to, and in Boston the signals are all too strong to transmit to.  Speaker works fine as a substitute.",3,1

"Well, when I first got this Mp3 I noticed that the screen was going black at odd times pretty regularily. At first I thought it was going into sleep-mode, by me accidentily pressing the wrong button. But then, I'd be watching a video on it or playing one of it's games, and the screen would flikker and then go black. If I pressed a button it would come back for a few seconds an then, again, go black. VERY frustrating. I figure somthing must be wrong with my screen. I even watched video's (Trying to get he screen back) with only the sound playing.    I had already read other reveiws that reported this problem, but thought (Seeing as there were'nt many) that it's just the average Mp3 glich every now and then.     I'm glad this thing came with a 30 day warranty. I'm sending it back for a new one. If it happens again.......     Besides that problem, the video and sound quality, is very good. Very nice surround sound. Loved the head-phones. Nice picture program. The FM radio was also pretty good for an Mp3. It has 3 games. Tetris, Boxman, and Snake. (Boxman is a fun time killer)    Downloading video can be a little difficult for people who aren't very compter savy (Me).",3,1

"This holder is customized for the Panavise series of mounts (e.g. [[ASIN:B000M8248G Panavise InDash Mount 04-06 Toyota Sienna]]) - and as such, it provides an excellent \\""total solution\\"" to hold your phone in your car.  The holder adds to the real estate on the dash, rather than blocking any of the controls that are there - and the position is excellent.<br /><br />The holder itself could have been done better though (like, say, be designed for the 21st century).  Most phones nowadays will be small enough that the two \\""ears\\"" on the side will either grab the very top of the phone (as with mine: [[ASIN:B000FDZLZQ Motorola A1200 MING Phone (Unlocked)]]), or else not at all.  As well, given that, the bottom rest is a bit too shallow; the phone tends to want to slide off the holder (unless you, like me, use the gravity of a charger cable to hold it back in place).",3,1

"This is the first Amazon review that I have ever felt compelled to write. I was running a JL Audio 1000/1 on 2 Kicker L-7 10\\"" subs. It was absolutely incredible!! Well, my JL malfunctioned and I did not want to wait the 6 week turnarond to get it repaired, so I sold it and since I could not afford another one, I researched for quite awhile to find one that was comparable that I could afford, which brought me to the Boston GT 2300. This amp compared to the JL is like a mouse going up against a god. I may just be spoiled because of the JL's sound quality, I don't know, but this amp does not hit ANYWHERE near as hard as the JL. It may be one hell of an amp for mids and highs, I don't know, that's not what I got it for, so don't write this amp off just yet. It may be good for subs, just not in the L7 sub or 1000 watt class (which is what this amp and the JL puts out). The JL would give you a headache at 1/2 gain (on the amp) and level 6 (out of 15) on my Alpine CDA-117 head unit. I had to turn the gain up to 3/4 (amp) and level 15 (Alpine) to get this thing to hit anywhere even remotely close to that JL.<br />Needless to say, I was very disappointed in this amp as I was hoping for much more from Boston. Right out of the box, I thought that something was not right when this amp weighs maybe a little more than 1/2 of the JL and its just as big (even longer). The end caps are plastic also. I just do not think that this amp is worth even the $300 that I paid for it on sale, much less the $500 that it' going for at most places. Now, I'm going to give the Rockford Fosgate T1500-1bdCP a try. From what I've heard, that will give the JL a run for it's money although it's not as flexible and it's a little (not a hell of a whole lot) cheaper.<br /><br />Update (3/23/12)- I ended up sending the JL amp in for repair and there was only a 2 week turnaround! They even replaced one of the endcaps that was broken (which had nothing to do with the problem with the amp). It cost me a flatrate of $180 for the repair with a 90 day warranty. Needless to say, JL Audio is the way to go if you want the best. That's been 4 months ago and I haven't had a single problem since, except for an occasional headache or two!!",3,2
"little top peice came off, glued it back",3,1
These are cheap and you get what you pay for.  They work some time and about half the time my phone will not charge unless I wiggle it around and position it just perfectly.,3,2
Overall I'm ok with it.. Color was NICE hot pink. the cord is very short and the prong piece that plugs into phone is really long... so it doesn't fully plug into phone.. and you have to hold battery pack and phone at the same with the cord being short.. The battery pack takes a REALLY long time to charge... and then it takes awhile to charge the phone.  BUT ULTIMATLEY it has kept my phone ALIVE when I needed it too which is why I bought it! And the flash light is a nice added feature!,3,1
"This unit replaced an equally mediocre iLuv Ipod mini system. My daughter has had it for about a year already and surprisingly everything is still working. The sound from the included speakers is muddy but OK for background listening. Ipods are already a compromise in sound quality, adding a system such as this to the mix does nothing to enhance it. If you are looking for a system that delivers good quality sound and only offers a few options you are better off opting for Altec Lansing, Bose, Klipsch or Logitech. If multiple playback options is your cup of tea then this system may be worth a glance.  Shop around you can get this unit for much less than what is advertised.",3,1
"I purchased this at a local store on a clearance sale. I gave this item 3 stars because it works for my intended use. I wanted a portable stereo to play audiobooks (in mp3 format) for my wife and myself while on vacation. I put the mp3 book files on SD cards or a flash drive. This unit works fine with both inputs. The radio section is actually good. Sound quality for voice is fine, with music, it's marginal. The CD section is a joke. I am now on my third unit, having returned the first two. None of them will play any kind of CD. Since I really have no desire to play CD's I finally just kept the third one. It works well for my limited use. If you're looking for a portable stereo that actually plays CD's, keep looking. The price on this is low for a reason.",3,1
"I was very happy with this unit the first few days, and then in popped in half.  It still works, but I had to tape it back together.  (This was not from abuse; it's just simple plastic that snaps together and it's awkward enough getting it in and out of a microphone stand with a Shure mic that a bit of pressure was all it took.) <br /> <br />Audio quality was okay, but I kept having problems with distortion, Going back to my M-Audio Ozone was much much nicer -- so it's probably the cheapness of the MicPlug.  For the price, though, it's hard to beat and I'm glad I have it (if it had not snapped in two ;-).",3,1
It could be made better.,3,1
This product don't have a good way to mount it. It don't come with any instructions on how or where to mount it.,3,1
"This cable works perfectly, but it wasn't designed the best. The better cable is the L9, which places the cable coming out of the dock on the side, rather than the bottom. This makes for a much smaller package when trying to stick your ipod and a DAC in your pocket.",3,1
"I purchased this for my teenage daughter. While she loves the appearance, when the cover is on, some buttons are not accessible. She purchased a clear protective cover for the screen and now no longer uses the cover.",3,1
"Doesn't charge two phones at the same time, the second only gets some power. It's also hard to remove from the outlet.",3,2
"I have this unit installed for over a month. My initial impressions were all positive.  Everything worked as advertised. However, within the past 2 weeks the unit has been acting up.  The Nav system stopped working. The Bluetooth, works intermittently. I've had to do a power on reset about 3x now to get everything back up and running. Of course each time the preset's had been lost. Including all of the other audio settings as well.    I'm now at a point where I need to send it in for repair.     YMMV    Model:  INA-W900BT         Send to:     Alpine Electronics of America, Inc.                   6590 Darin Way Cypress, CA 90630       Include Warranty Info- Included  Original Invoice-Included from Electronica Direct, through the Amazon on-line store.    Problem Description:    Purchased 7/14/2010, Received 7/21/2010.    Installed: 8/3/2010    Initially everything was working correctly, between 8/3/2010 - 8/14/2010. No issues at all.    First problem occurance: 8/14/2010, while driving for 6 hour road trip, approximatley 3 hours into the drive, the MAP/NAVI Warning Screen, with the OK button was presented. I accepted the warning and it began to work again. Later in the drive, approximatley 20-30 minutes, without shutting car or system off, the MAP/NAVI Warning Screen, with OK button came back up. I accepted the warning and it began to work. This happened 3 more times, during that drive. Once I got home, I attempted a power on reset. This cleared the issue up and I did not receive any other MAP/NAVI Warning Screens, other than normal startup.   From 8/14/2010 - morning of 8/23/2010 the unit worked correctly. No issues.    Second problem occurance: 8/23/2010 @ 4:45-5:00PM PST, on my drive home, I noticed it started to do this same thing again. The MAP/NAVI Warning Screen would periodically come on. I would accept, and it would resume working. This happened around 2x. On the third try, the MAP/NAVI system was no longer usable. Nothing came up when I selected the MAP/NAVISource button. Everything else on the unit continued to function correctly. The evening of 8/24/2010 @ 6:30PM PST. I disconnected the vehicle battery. Let sit for 30 minutes, then reattached the negative on the vehicle battery. I immediatley, went through the Power on Reset function. Once the reset function was complete, the unit then worked, including MAP/NAVI source.     *Note, all other functionality still works correctly when this behavior is experienced. (The unit has Alpine Bluetooth, AlpineBackup Camera, and iPod interface all connected and working correctly.)    Around, 8/18-8/19, I can't remember, I called Alpine Tech Support, and they suggested I contact the seller for a replacement. I contacted the Seller, and they said they could not help me, and that I had to send it back to Alpine. The unit had been purchased over 30days from them.     On 8/24/2010, I contacted Alpine, they instructed me to send it in to a Authorized Service Center, for repair.",3,2
"It does the job. However, features are quite limited. There is no 'shuffle' function (at least I don't see one). There is no user manual, probably on account of its basic design. Still, it does what is says it would do.",3,1
The first thing I noticed about this when I opened it was the fact that it looked like a cheap Chinese battery with the  PortaCell wrapper around it.  In fact there was so much extra wrapper around the battery that it does not fit good in the iPod.  Another reason I believe this is a cheap battery in a pretty package.    Time will tell.  I'll report back after I have used the iPod for awhile.,3,2
the item didn't meet my expectation simply because I was looking for an MP3 player with a camera  for my 5 year old grandson.<br />This one to complicated for one that young.  Otherwise might have been better for an older child.  Seller was very<br />understanding about the matter and quick to respond to my concern.,3,1
Hi i First Ordered this Product from DiscountJungle i got it Because of All the Features First i was sent the Wrong one but Sent them an Email and got it Fixed and i Swapped for the PTID-8970NRB but Overall i was Glad they Fixed the Problem Even if it did Take a Long Time to Fix but at Least the Product Works one NOTE you cant Just Touch what Song you want when Playing a MP3 or Mostly a DVD.,3,1
"I do not own the exact model listed here, but I do have the RCD-670 which is a competent machine. The RCD-670 has AM, FM, CD, CDMP3 available. I have used the fm tuner which leaves something to be desired as there is too much station overlap, but I can receive the local stations and the sound is very good. One is classical pop, the other NPR and classic music. Both are good. The CD player is fine as is the MP3 ability.  The device is blue, relatively small and sturdy. The controls are not real instinctive, but there is an instruction booklet. The power is plug in or 8 C batteries.I have only used plug in. Sound is good for the size and type of the device.",3,1
Makes the ipod too bulky.  The stylas will not stay plugged in.  I tried it on several others and its the same problem.,3,2
I tried on several occasions to get this device to work properly. The ipad seem to heavy for the holder and i had too keep adjusting it for view. the hardware is a little cheap but hey you get what you pay for.,3,2
the little plastic piece on the side broke 2 days after my daughter started using it. It seems to still be staying on though.,3,2
"Naza is now the most popular aircraft stabilization system.  In GPS mode, the Naza-M will hover in a stationary position.  You can hear the props change speed as the aircraft fights the wind.  You can also set the mode so controls will work relative to the aircraft or the flyer.  This is especially helpful for new flyers.<br /><br />Having said that, there is a problem that has bitten a number of flyers.  If you crash (even a mild crash or hard landing) the accelerometers can get stuck, resulting in an unflyable aircraft.  There has been some success in fixing this problem by giving the Naza a HARD rap on the side opposite the crash location.  I was flying when my quadcopter did a 180 and flew into the ground.  Fortunately, it was about six feet up, so there was no physical damage to the aircraft.  However, this is scary.  A device this expensive should not have a problem this prolific.  Who wants to risk a thousand dollar aircraft on a potentially unstable controller?  I hope DJI Innovations resolves this problem soon.<br /><br />Also, tech support is extremely slow, assuming you get a response.  If you purchase from a local dealer, at least you have a local person to troubleshoot and resolve warranty issues.  I bought my Phantom online (it uses the Naza-M as the flight controller) so I am having difficulty getting a warranty repair.<br /><br />I would have given this review 5 stars because of the stellar performance, except for the problems mentioned above.",3,1
"I originally bought this several years ago because I wanted a way to convert my large collection of cassette tapes onto CD and I wanted one convenient unit to perform this without resorting to a computer or software program.    I would say that I give this unit mixed results. While it IS indeed convenient to have a CD recorder recording directly from the cassette player(and LP), the quality of the recording is just ok. Sometimes there is some background noise on the CD when converting the cassette to CD.    I haven't used the LP so I can't comment on that. You can't use the CD recorder to record directly from the radio, which is disappointing. The price was/is a bit steep(over four hundred when I got it) and the quality(build and sound) doesn't quite match.    Unfortantly there is not too many choices out there for cassette-to-CD recording aside from getting a USB type cassette deck that hooks up to your PC(which you can then transfer the files digitally). This unit looks nice but the quality isn't there and it doesn't function that well.",3,2
Owned this for almost a year now and I've loved it to death with it's wonderful screen quality and how well it's design is it has everything I needed and more. But I cannot recommend any Iriver product to anyone due to their horrible warranty service. With less than a month left on my first year of ownership my screen suddenly quit working on the Clix and after E-mail attempts and several phone calls (all either to a recording were I left a message and phone number or simply got a busy signal) I have yet to hear back from them. due to the screen issue it is now nothing more than an over sized Ipod Shuffle as I can get to the random play of the songs out of memory to listen to them. Its a shame this great product wasn't made by a more reputable company.,3,2
This is a great buy for the price if you throw your ITouch in a purse or a briefcase.  The magnetic tab works well.  The only thing I don't like about it is that when playing solitaire the edge of the case can get in the way of tapping the edge of the screen.,3,1
"When I first saw the product, i liked that the picture showed - that the front part did not cover the bottom and top part of the screen, and the back was black. BUT when I got it in the mail, it was the complete opposite. the front covered the top and bottom part, and the back had 2 slits, which very easily allow dirt and other matters in from the back - which also caused many scratches to back of the actually itouch.<br /><br />However, the price was cheap, and the silicon does prevent it from sliding easily.",3,2
The shipping was fast. It is difficult to fit in the Ipod in the arm band. Also the arm band gets real wet if you sweat a lot during your workouts.,3,1
"This cassette MP3 player is very clearly a cheap product for a very niche market. It's slow, the controller takes forever to make work, but it beats running a tape adapter from an old iPod touch to my stereo.",3,2
I bought it with another purchace and can't use the other item I bought so I will be returning this.,3,2
"This was not the one I wanted, I wanted the BlackJack II.  NO problems with the seller, everything on their end was great.  Only problem was ALL SALES FINAL.  So I can not return it.",3,2
"I ordered this to replace one that was lost in a fire.  I still had the adapter from my last one that can be used to charge my iPod in a wall outlet, so I ordered this replacement cable to fit the adapter (firewire).  The seller was great and my cable arrived very quickly.  Unfortunately, this cable doesn't work to sync my iPod.  It charges great when plugged into my computer or used with my firewire adapter in the wall outlet, but I have no means of syncing my iPod.  Since charging works, I can only assume that the wire isn't completely compatible with my generation of iPod touch.  Sad.<br /><br />When charging, I love that this is retractable.  It keeps the wires from getting kinked when I stuff it in a drawer and they're not all over the place when I'm charging it in the wall outlet.  It keeps the wire nice and neat for travel.  Overall, it is a good product, just not fully compatible with my iPod.",3,1
Pros:  cute color  stretches to fit most arm sizes  very secure    Cons:  I have to take any case off my phone to get it to fit  Can't press the buttons real good through the plastic  kinda on the bulky side    I got this really cheap so I'm satisfied with it. But I found myself not using it very much because it was such a hassel to have to take the protective case off my phone every time I wanted to use it.,3,1
"I needed a portable CD player for a class that I am taking; in order to play lectures, my instructor delivered the lectures on CD's that this player does not recognize. My only other option was to download her lectures in mp3 format from Dropbox. I am playing those lectures on my Samsung Galaxy, using the Sony headphones that I ordered along with this CD player.",3,1
"I absolutely love the overall function of the case, but they simply do not last long. The plastic eventually cracks in various areas, forcing replacement. I've purchased 2 of these. When the time comes, I send one to Speck to get it replaced and then use the other until it too begins to break down requiring replacement. So I'm constantly rotating my cases. Yes, this seems stupid, but it works for me. I haven't been able to find a case that protects the phone as well as this one without being too ugly. Fix the durability issues and this case would be perfect.     The other issue that I should mention is that the case is thick. So I purchased a Dock Extender from a company called Sendstation.",3,1
does the job but not very powerful...I would just by pay a little more for jawbone.,3,1
"Excellent condition, but a few function issues.",3,1
"This case is a little oversized for the 7\\"" Pandigital. I thought it would be a better fit, but the price was right.",3,2

"Was not completely happy with product, as id didn't fit properly on the Ipod, and kept falling off.  Not sure what the problem is, but likely not the seller's fault.",3,2
The adapter broke after 2 months of use. Split in half. not very well made. It did work well before that,3,2
It's OK,3,1
"I purchased this Anti Glare screen protector for 2 reasons: 1) I wated to read easier under sunlight and 2) The \\""naked\\"" screen gets dirty so fast with finger smudges I was hoping this could help keep it a bit cleaner.  Well, I believe this product will easily accomplish both.   I like the fact that it was easy to apply and even though I did get a few tiny bubbles on the outside edge, I barely noticed them so its really not a big deal.     The reason I gave it 3stars is because now my screen seems very grainy to me...and it's very annoying.   In fact, I'm not sure I will actually leave the screen protector on just because of this.  Maybe my eyes are just sensitive ....I don't know but its like going from HDTV quality back to standard definition ...adjusting the brightnness didn't seem to clear it up for me.   I just didn't expect this to happen because I have a screen protector on my cell phone and it's perfectly undetectable.  Of course that was a different product though.... Anyway... Im just feeling disappointed.  Another thing I didn't like was the stylus pen.  It just didn't work as well as I expected it to.   I have to tap or swipe something 2 or 3 times before the device responds.   OTOH, I can use my finger and make a selection on the first try.  Perhaps the stylus will work better without the screen protector applied. Bottom line- I wanted to love this product, but for me it is \\""just ok\\"".",3,1
I hooked the subs up to a buddie's amp and they sound awesome! But the wiring kit and the amp is the worst I've ever owned. Would not recommend!!!,3,1
"I got it for my Hyundai Terracan 2007. I put the box inside the area assigned for the jack (plenty of room up there). Very good place since you can access it very easy. Just be sure to connect the red wire to the wire of the backing lamp instead of a 12VCD (the \\""R\\"" on the manual is stated for \\""reverse\\"" and not for \\""red\\"" despite the wire is red too). Very easy to install, and it works very well. The speaker I also installed inside that compartment since outside may get knocked by bags etc, and the removable door has plenty of holes that should let the sound get out without problems.<br /><br />The device makes sounds of increasing frequency as you approach closer to an obstacle like a person / car / wall / trailer, etc. Very nice also, a voice tells you the distance to the objects (in metric units - great for me, I prefer them) and if you get too close it says \\""stop! stop!\\"" and a steady and higher pitch buzzer tells you to really stop.<br />I connected it together with the backing camera of Koolertron.<br />see here: [[ASIN:B0042EIU7A Koolertron® CMOS Car Reverse Rearview camera for Hyundai ELANTRA Accent Tucson Terracan & KIA Carens Oprius Sorento Borrego]]<br /><br />And also with the Koolertron (TM) Car DVD Navigation player with Digital Screen for Hyundai:Elantra/Sonata/Santa Fe/Tucson/Terracan/Matrix<br />see here: [[ASIN:B0043TYRT4 Koolertron (TM) Car DVD Navigation player with Digital Screen for Hyundai:Elantra/Sonata/Santa Fe/Tucson/Terracan/Matrix]]<br /><br />The device can work alone and I like it without the \\""trashy looking\\"" display of other models.

GREAT!!!<br /><br />To make it perfect the \\""high\\"" switch position of the switch on the speaker should deliver a higher volume. The low is nearly not useful if you are parking on a noisy street.

It does not look bad anyway.<br /><br />But I strongly recommend this product and the seller has responded very fast and positively to my several questions.<br /><br />UPDATE: after a couple of months, the speaker sometimes does not work or it makes weird noises instead of the voice it used to reproduce with the distance and warnings.

"I received this a day ago.  The case feels and looks good.  I am disappointed in the case though, because the straps that hold the Novel in place also cover the on/off button.  This is a very, very poor design. The straps are also pretty flimsy.  When charging the Novel, the case has to lie open, or the Novel has to be taken out of the case because there is no cutout in the spine of the case to allow the adapter to go into the Novel for charging.   Once the Novel is in the case, it is also hard to close.  You have to position the case just right in order to get it to lie flat in the closed position.  Additionally, the magnet in the flap that is supposed to hold the case closed, is not very strong, and the case does not remain closed.  I also attempted to use the case as a stand when reading, and sometimes it will stay and sometimes it won't.    I am not going to return the case because I did get what I ordered, but I would not order it again, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.",3,2
"This product took over a month and a half to get here, and didn't last very long at all. The jack on my ear buds do not fit in the holes, and it takes a lot of effort to jam them in.

I'll update my review in a week and let you know what happens.",3,2
"More than two years ago I purchased my first Sony PRS 505 Digital Reader.  I loved it and I have read 25-35 books each year since then.  Gradually the battery started running down more and more quickly and I learned that I would have to return my Sony to the factory to get a new battery which meant no book for several weeks and significant expense approaching $75-100.  I learned on Amazon of a do-it-yourself battery replacement for under $30 and ordered that.  The video looked very simple; unfortunately when I attempted the replacement it did not work out like the video and I wound up with a non-functioning e-reader.  So...I considered switching to Kindle but since I have a couple of dozen unread books for the Sony that would have meant losing those books or embarking on a time-consuming process to convert them to work on the Kindle.  I decided to get the Touch Edition Sony Digital Reader.  It is attractive but as many have reported there are signifcant glare issues.  I am supposed to be able to turn pages by swiping my fingers on the screen but that works only some of the time.  The page turning buttons at the bottom work fine.  My greatest disappointment, however, is the battery life.  Even after fully charging it with the accessory charger (not the USB) it starts running down much more quickly than the PRS 505 did when new.  At present I suspect my battery runs down enough that I have to recharge it every five days of perhaps 60-90 minutes reading per day.  The PRS 505 initially would not run down for more than a couple of weeks if not being used much and for more than a week using it for daily reading.  The Touch Edition battery is certainly not an improvement.  I will likely stop buying Sony ebooks and when I have read the ones I currently have I will switch to a Kindle.",3,2

"It is a good HRM.  It is sensitive, accurate and uses very little power.  So, why a 3 star rating?  The battery compartment is held shut by 4 tiny specialty screws.  They are easily stripped.  And, if they are stripped, there is no easy way to replace them.  I much prefer the other battery compartment design that allows you to open and shut the compartment using a coin.  I never had any problem with any of the 3 other HRMs I owned previously.  Twist open with a coin, replace battery and twist shut.  No hunting for tiny Phillps screwdrivers and fear stripping the screws!  I just emailed Garmin asking about replacement screws.  This is aggravating no matter what the outcome.",3,1

"It's hard to get the size... had to buy it, but overpriced.",3,2
Not sellers fault it is a nice idea but difficult to use once under the plastic. Also difficult to use while working out,3,2
"This item shipped fairly fast; however, it is very, very thin and a little loose on the iPod. Of course, for only a couple bucks, it's adequate. You get what you pay for.",3,1
Didn't realize it was a sticker....returned...good company to deal with.,3,2
"I don't like it but my kid loves it, was an xmas gift, its cardboard how great can it be....LOL",3,1
"Bought one of these originally in a store for my wife's iPod nano and really liked it. But it was the last one, so ordered online. Arrived in a expected shape and works as it should.",3,1
This works as advertised but the range is a bit limited for whole house use. The battery works for a few hours so you have to remember to shut it off after every use or recharge it.,3,1
Bluetooth connection to my HTC EVO is easy and sound volume is good on both ends of a call. The only trouble is the sound coming from a call sounds like its coming from someone in a box,3,1
This cable works great for uploading your ipod music right into your stereo. I found though that the cord is really short for the limited space that I have to place my phone and so it makes it hard to angle the phone properly so I can also use my gps... I found that I prefer to use my long AUX cord and then choose my music from the phone itself.,3,1
"It is a great item for playing my ipod in my car.  However, this cord does not simultaneously charge, which is very disappointing.",3,2
"I am not a bodybuilder by any stretch of the imagination.  So imagine my surprise I ordered this and I can't even get it to fit around my biceps. Other than that, I think it is very good.",3,1
I like the CD player but the radio always goes off station and is fuzzy. Also there is a hum when nothing is on but it is plugged in.,3,2
"Everyday I use this camcorder , once I drove on freeway the GPS speed display not working, but it had the GPS and speed display on the computer when using DOD player,  tried so many time, E-Prance keep saying is my signal problem, even I have my top down, the GPS still not work right , tried to contact E-Prance, every time they have excuse",3,2
"Bought this for my daughter, the corner of case broke off and thin part of case above camera cracked.  She saved up to purchase the ipod with her own money and is pretty careful with it.  Case still does what it is meant to do, disappointed with the quality.  There are probably other cases in this price range that are better quality.",3,2
i dont understand why people buy this king of cover. it just like something to hide the true color of ur ipod so why dont consider a transparent cover?,3,1
"When I opened this cover and put in my Nook, the clasp was on the bottom so it won't lay flat.   I've never seen a cover with the clasp on the bottom.  Was given the option of returning it by the seller.  Look at the picture closely before you order if you prefer the clasp on the top.",3,2
"I would not suggest this e-reader to someone who isn't already familiar and comfortable with using e-readers.  The User's Manual was a short, cheap printer print out, with very little useable information.  The e-reader itself is very nice looking, and is the perfect size.  It does not come with a case, but does come with headphones, USB cable, and charger adapter.  The battery life is fabulous, better than my Augen \\""the book,\\"" but nowhere as good as my Kindle, as expected.  I got mine brand new for around 30 dollars.  I took it out of the box, plugged in the adapter and let it charge for about four hours.  When I went to turn it on, it didn't appear to be working.  The power light came on, but nothing showed up on the display.  Since I only paid around 30 dollars for the unit, I didn't want to bother returning it for another one, so I gave it to my husband to fix.  He had it fixed quickly. He took it apart, and saw that the display cable was not plugged into its port.  He plugged it in, made sure it was secure, and put the unit back together.  Problem solved.  I saw someone mention that theirs turned on and displayed, but the touch screen didn't work. This is probably the same issue. The display cable was probably not plugged in all the way.  As for use, I'm happy with the unit, but again, if you are not familiar with it's Linux system (like the one on the Augen \\""The Book\\"") then you may be a bit lost.  You can learn how to use it by playing around with it, as many of the functions are intuitive, but some are a bit odd, and take a while to figure out.  This until came with no books pre-loaded on it.  I got onto the Wi-Fi and browser with no problems.  However, when I went to Kobo.com and Archive.org to get some free ebooks, neither webpage would load past 90%, and it took me 45 minutes to open the link to a book I wanted, and then the unit locked up, and I had to hit the reset button on the back.  Luckily, the stylus fits in the reset hole - that was handy.  Instead,I plugged it into the USB on my computer, launched UDisk on the reader, and downloaded some books that way.  I also copied the 150 ebooks off of my Augen onto it, through my computer.  That worked nicely.  I was considering getting one of these for my mother, for her birthday, but since it's very hard to download books with the Wi-Fi, I won't be getting her one of these, as she does not have a computer to plug into, like I do.  Instead, I will be getting her an Augen \\""The Book,\\"" and then if she really likes e-reading, I will later get her a Kindle - the pinnacle of e-readers, in my opinion.  I do like this until well enough that I will be getting more, so my children can each have one.  We are a reading family, so I know this will be a good investment.  All in all, I rated this product three stars, because the price is right, but it is a bit buggy, and does not come with a very good User's Manual.  Further, mine didn't work when I first got it, but my husband was easily able to fix it.  I currently have four e-readers (I have a large family).  I would rate this unit better than our Literati, just a step or two below our Augen, but not nearly as good as my Kindle.",3,1
I haven't used yet but the charger I recieved is not the one shown. It is a mini charger instead and not what the picture shows it should be.,3,2

"I've owned this GlobSat BC-337 for some time now.  I used it with iGuidance mapping in an HP PDA HW6925.  The configuration works \\""OK\\"".  I assume the PDA is not very fast so it is a bit quirky.  The PDA will often hang.  Many times the iGuiance software won't load and I need to reset the PDA.  This is not an issue with the BC-337,however.  In my opinion, if you want a GPS, get a TomTom or Garmin, something made for that specific purpose.  Trying to get a PDA to be all things results in a device that does a lot of things marginally.     I've used the BC-337 in my old HP nc6000 and this works great. Large screen!  Now I recently upgraded to an HP 2710p tablet.  The potential to use the BC-37 in this smaller tablet seemed like a great idea, unfortunately, the 2710p does not have a PCMCIA slot.  It uses something called expresscard/54.  I purchased an adapter that allows me to connect the BC-337 into this expresscard/54 slot.  Unfortunately, this configuration does not recognize the BC-337. I assume I need some kind of driver to support this expresscard/54.  I've sent multiple emails to the GlobalSac site and have yet to hear from them.  If you are concerned about service, this lack of response should be a red flag.  I think this card will find its way to my junk drawer.",3,2
"I read many good reviews of this product from truck owners and I decided to buy it for my Mitsubishi Galant sedan. Although, I appreciate a bit of extra bass in my music (the reason I bought them), I am not one of those 2-sub 1000+ watt bass freaks. My idea was to get clean bass without compromising too much on trunk space. These fit nicely in the trunk due to their compact size. However, I think my old Sony 12\\"" subwoofer (non-shallow design) produced much cleaner and tighter bass than these shallow subs. My installer at Bestbuy (who is in this business for 15 years) simply said these sound like s*** after installing them. I kind of agreed with him.     I think they do produce a decent amount of oomph. But firstly there's not enough bass coming thru when they are installed in your sedan's trunk, and secondly whatever comes thru is not clean/tight enough. My key takeaway from this experience is that if you want to get one decent subwoofer in your sedan's trunk, then don't go for a shallow mount sub. Instead buy the Kicker L5s, Alpine Type-Rs, or the likes of that. They sound much better than these.",3,1
I purchased this item but have not used it yet as it is part of my resolution to go  running and use it,3,1
I purchased this item directly from Tuf-Luv before it was available on Amazon. The item I recieved is not the same as pictured here. Mine slips in from the side and does not have the snap at the top. Fit is a little loose. Leather quality is great! the cover is very good looking.,3,2
The best item is this package is the hard case.  I've really abused mine and is still great.  The USB charger is good but I could have lived without the rest of this stuff.,3,1
"Unfortunately, cassette deck car radios are hard to find this one works, but no frills.",3,2
"This cable worked for converting a male iPhone dock connector to a micro-USB and audio adapter.  However, after 2.5 months of use in my car the cable is failing.  I think a wire broke near the micro-usb jack.  The cable should have had more support at the connector to prevent it from flexing so much.",3,2
"It's an acceptable cover for the Nook Color. The fit is secure but sloppy - not snug. It attracts the hair from my dogs and is loathe to turn it loose, and I'm not one to complain of \\""dust magnets\\"" or fingerprints. It provides a minimal protection. Finally, it improves handling the Nook, but would be better if the fit was more snug. For $8.99 that I paid it's OK.",3,2
"The price is right, theres no doubt about that. the items i received seemed to be all in working condition. i was bothered by the fact that 2 of the cases werent in packaging, while the other 2 was. all the other stuff was in packaging to. makes ya wonder if they were used for a lil while and returned or what. no damage to them tho. All in all its a good deal. Just cant understand why 2 cases werent packaged.",3,1
"It's just what you're paying for... No more, no less.<br /><br />The box contains exactly what's advertised.<br /><br />The image is not HD really... And the quality of the product (materials, button operation, etc), it's quite poor.<br /><br />I don't recommend it anyway... It may be better to save some more cash and buy a GoPro cam or something like that.",3,2
"Stores a lot of music, it sounds good. It is very very difficult to maneuver the menus, not intuitive and the instructions are too minimal. It seems like all the features work, but being able to use them is a lot of work.",3,1
The words doesn't blink.. and I never received a remote with it.,3,2
I had a few problems with this product. First off the product is a little flimsy and doesn't tend to stay upright. Accelerate too fast or take a turn too sharply and the stand will fall over. My second problem is a little weird. I dock my iPhone4 in this and I've noticed while in the clasps the GPS has problems locating where I am and lags horribly. If I move my GPS out by even an inch from the wings holding it in it magically works again. Tried this with my boyfriend's iPhone4 with the same result. Quite odd. Makes using it as a GPS stand a little useless. Otherwise it works well transmitting your music to your radio and charging your phone.,3,1
"Just got the travel case and it sounds fine in the case.  Seems very flimsy and thin for $50.  Also, although there are buttons on the top to access those buttons, there is no access to the power button without unzipping the case.  Also, there is no place to store the power cord.  Sadly, this is the only protective case for this product so I will keep it. I think it will serve its purpose of safely transporting the speaker, but disappointed overall.",3,1
umm these headphones are okay. My only complaint is that the right ear is louder than the left one. Its like one side has more bass than the other. At first I thought the left one didn't work. I was like wtf I just took them out the pack. But you could clearly tell that one side is louder than the other (and no I don't have bad hearing lol). Maybe i just got a bad pair or maybe that's how they suppose to sound. Overall they're just ok,3,1
"This cover definitely fits my old iPod nano, but I don't like the weird earbud wrap around thingy on the back.  I bought this for use in my classroom and the kids just play with the earbud holder and I'm afraid they might rip the silicone after time.  For now, it is working, but I am afraid it might not last.",3,2
Worked as expected,3,1
The cases completely cover the buttons - which is something we did not realize when we bought it.,3,2
"It seems well made but I am worried about the belt clip breaking because it is really hard to get it on my belt cuz it is so stiff.  I have an Ipod Touch 2nd generation and it is too big for this case; I can't get it all the way in and I definitely can't get the top button to snap cuz it is too small.  Also it is a bit of a pain to play games or to use an on screen keyboard cuz of the sides of the case.  But, I love the fact that I can put it on my belt or pants so I am going to keep it for now anyway.",3,1
"If you are looking for a cheap mount this is the way to go. Material on the bottom feels frictiony if that makes sense, almost sticky but not. plastic on top is great for the suction cup. i was pleasantly surprised with this purchase. I had the old garmin bag mount which was wonderful and nice because i didn't have to worry about the suction cup. but my gps and mount were stolen along with my car, so i replaced it with this and i'm happy with it!<br /><br />update<br /><br />this thing has a tough time in cold weather. i have had it slide clear off the dash a few times when i turned a bit sharp. really not hard. my other mount didn't slide. once it warms up above 40 or so it sticks well and doesn't slide. but take caution if you live in a cold climate, this thing may go flying.",3,1
I order this as a Christmas present for my Granddaughter's Nook. The Nook was also a Christmas present. It didn't show up until a week after Christmas which was well outside of the promised delivery window.  In the end she was happy with the product but the surprise of having a personalized Nook didn't happen.,3,1
Many of the pieces are redundant.  The leather case was nice and the wall charger came in handy....,3,1
"I really like the look and feel of the Minisuit Touch Case. The high-friction silicone material gives me a secure grip on my iPod. It also prevents the device from sliding around when I lay it down on a table or prop it up. It also does a good job protecting the iPod from accidental bumps and short drops. Unfortunately, the \\""stickiness\\"" of the silicone also creates problems. I love my iPod because of its portability. It's so small I can slip it in my pants pocket or shirt pocket and take it anywhere. Unfortunately, the case makes putting the iPod in my pocket really difficult. The case sticks to most fabrics, which forces me to put a lot of effort into shoving the device into a pocket. Once it's in though, it stays in. It takes at least as much effort to remove it from the pocket again, and the case tends to peel off the iPod in the process; I almost always have to slip a corner or a side back on the device after it's out. As much as I like the look, feel and price of the Minisuit case, it's just not worth the difficulty of putting it in my pocket.",3,1
"Too big for my regular Nook, I gave it away to my mom for her Nook color, fit pretty well on that.",3,1
"A difficult review in the sense that the sellers service was excellent and the product is well made.  My only difficulty is in the fact that the leather surrounding the charging port hits the base of the connector body.  As a result, one must apply significant pressure for proper connection.  I tried several different cables, but all had the same result.<br /><br />No doubt a well constructed case, and I'll likely use it when I take the iPod touch traveling.  Overall, this is not a problem, but does detract from the overall functionality.  Excellent protection of the screen for sure.",3,1
This case is really pretty and I like it but the sides broke and I brought it to the Bahamas and when I came back my front camera wasn't working anymore..,3,2
I have no real grip with this item. I like it for the most part. Its pretty much a no frills accessory which is fine in most cases. It performs fine and it does what its supposed to. Its nothing outstanding as far as electronics are concerned but I would still recommend it.,3,1
"Great for the car, but you have to be gentle connecting and disconnecting; if the wires are pulled, you may not be making a complete connection. I may buy another onejust for safe keeping",3,1
I got this for my son's nook and I wish the material was just a little bit thicker.  A slight hole has also formed over time.,3,1
"love the design, it just doesn't hold together on each corner of the case, that's a little said and a problem",3,1
"I mounted this unit in my pick up truck. It will not please a true audiophile but it is good enough for me. The main place that I could see a bit more engineering could be used id the front panel. This panel is just plain hard to see. You can switch the colors and some are easier than others but overall any glare at all and it will require more than momentary attention to tweak this unit to what you are trying to achieve. It is so colorful it actually looks somewhat out of place, but I like it........",3,1
This case is alright if this is all you have. fit is loose. can't beat price,3,1
"After reading the many reviews on this product, and similar products, I decided on this one, by Maxsa, since reviewers seemed to be more pleased with its quality and functionality.  Especially the described \\""longer duration\\"" that the lasers remained on after being triggered.  Well, the reviews are false, or my unit is defective, since the lasers on my unit REMAIN ON FOR ONLY 10 SECONDS.  Hardly long enough to complete a parking operation since I back in to my garage.  I am now attempting to contact the manufacturer to see if this unit is defective, since it doesn't mention the \\""on time\\"" in the instruction manual.  I will update this review at a later date, when I know more.<br /><br />**UPDATE: I spoke with Maxsa, over the telephone, and they confirmed that the unit is desigend to have a laser-on time of only 10-15 seconds.  They suggested that I relocate the unit to have a better \\""view\\"" of the vehicles, which I did and now it is working better.  However, in the process of re-alligning one of the laser heads, it popped-out of its \\""knuckle\\"" mount and so I pushed it back in, kinda of a \\""cheesy\\"" assembly I must say.  But it is working OK now, so I upped-it a star.  I will update this review again after it has been in service for a while.",3,1
"Package was quickly thrown in a bubble bag. Headphones did not work but that doesn't bother me much as they were not the reason why I bought the package.    Armband and silicon skin are OK but the skin does feel a little flimsy, we'll see how durable it is.     Chargers and retractable cable are a nice addition to my Zune travel kit.    Overall satisfied with the purchase, again what can you expect for less than 10$.",3,1
"this particular radio needs a major improvement--------you need to have the option of adding an adapter so when you are in your vehical you can put an outside antenna mounted on it for more usable radio and reception,r.cox",3,1
This worked great until the glue holding it together started dissolving after about 4 months and the case came apart. Now it's useless. I might keep the keyboard because it still works fine but I have to find a new case.,3,2
I haven't got it  to work yet.,3,1
There's nothing particularly fancy here. It efficiently holds a walkman and supplies storage for CDs. I can go on a long walk to the accompaniment of whatever I choose comfortably and efficiently.,3,1
"Decent enough product. However, the picture is deceiving. I ordered it b/c I thought the arm length was longer than others but it was not. In fact, it is much to short. A product like this needs to have at least the ability to extend another 7-9\\"".",3,2
Works OK but not sized accurately.  Did not fit properly.  (Needed to be fitted with a small insert of paper.),3,2
The rail wasn't straight so it made really hard to line the red dot sight up. Red dot sight is nice looking but both it and the lasers adjustments stink. Laser drifts off point with vibration and sight has a small range of adjustment. The best part is the flashlight...its super bright even during the day.,3,1
I like how it encloses the nook on all sides and that it is padded and lightweight. I wish though that I had chosen black instead of red.  The red is quite bright and distracts me when I am reading.  I also wish the magnet in the closure was double-sided so that it would hold the cover when I bend it to the back to read.,3,1
"I bought two of these speedometers, one for me and one for my boyfriend. His works great hasn't had one problem since I installed it on the bike. Mine however after only a short while started to malfunction gave random speeds while the bike wasn't even moving, so I got a replacement. That one worked for like two days than stopped working any time I went over six mph, I did however manage to fix this one on my own by adding a stronger magnet to the apparatus, it seems to be working so far. It reads zero when stopped sitting in the living room and reads fine up to my top speed of 23mph so far but time will tell, my boyfriend still has no trouble with his not a single one. I would guess it's a hit or miss depending on if you get one that works properly or not.  I would suggest that when installing that you calculate your own circumference rather than use the calculations provided. It's an easy install and relatively easy to use if it's working. Playing with it will help you figure out how to reset the distance, timer, and etc. It's really sensitive to motion so the thing doesn't like to turn off especially if you carry it in your pocket, but it's easy to get off and on, and so far it stays very secure and I travel some bumpy roads. The speed displayed is large enough to see while riding but there is no back light so you can't read it at night. For the price it's a good toy but only if you get a working one otherwise it's a hassle. Though it has been trouble some over all I like the thing and have fun estimating how far we travel.",3,1
The case seems like it is of good quality but I ordered the red color and received the wrong one. Probably would have given the product 5 stars if I got what I ordered.,3,1
"When I received the package, it had a hole in it and a few things were missing.  The house charger and the cable for use in the car were not there.  I tried to find a place on Amazon to get a message to the company that sent it but it was impossible. I finally had to go out and purchase the items at a retail store.",3,2

"Let me start off by saying, I DO really like this head unit. It completes the look of my interior. Now onto my more in-depth review..  Car installed in: 2007 VW EOS  Install difficulty level: Medium (if you know what you're doing)   Pros: Looks great; works, always a 'pro'; integrated with iPod/iPhone to charge and show song/artist titles on screen and ability change song (works with slacker radio and Pandora radio iPhone apps as well); definite upgrade from stock radio; basically plug and play (again, if you know what you're doing.); ability to change background display picture; fairly customizable; SD slot, big thumbs up. Could always load all your music onto a card and never have to hook your iPod up!  Neutral: Option to change button light color from green to red (or off) (don't like green and it doesn't go with the red/blue light \\""theme\\"" on dash and heat controls so I keep it red.); a previous comment had said this was an OEM radio which it is NOT. It is an OEM replica, hence the cheap price tag. It is comparable to OEM but without the actual OEM label. Not a good or bad thing, unless you are looking for genuine OEM; start up photo is the VW logo, which I like but it is not customizable so hope you like it too; clock is in military time (bothers me, may not be an issue for others.); I had to feed my iPhone cable through the bottom of the dash, doesn't bother me but it looks very 'aftermarket,' if you're going for a clean look you may want to feed it through (if able to) the back of your dash so it comes out in your ashtray area.  Cons: NAVIGATION NOT INCLUDED!!!!!!! You need to BUY THE INSTALL DISK/SOFTWARE YOURSELF. The seller should put this in the info, unfortunately I had to find this out for myself after the fact, so just saving you the trouble; screen is very touchy, could be a pro or a con depending; very, very bright display, I turn the display off (easily accessible button) while driving at night or I can't see the road.   Seller: I didn't have a problem with the seller, package arrived on time and in good condition.   I've only had this for a few days, but so far it seems to work good. I especially like the iPhone integration. I don't have the navi set up because as I stated before, it didn't come with the software and again, thanks to the seller for mentioning that in the info (sarcasm.) I also did not set up the blue tooth because I don't talk on my phone in my car enough to use that feature.  All in all, seems like a decent investment. Hope this review helps you out a little.",3,1
Doesnt come in box at all. Just zip baggies. But works fine. China product quality.,3,1

The first one was entirely too small - could not close the zipper all the way, and part of the device stuck out of the case; even though my TomTom was clearly listed in the applicable models list.  So, I tried again with a different brand case. The good news is that my TomTom fits nicely in this case and I can completely close the zipper. The bad news is that nothing else will fit in this case. It has a mesh pocket to hold other things, but I'll be luck to fit my business card into the pocket and still be able to close the case. I wanted a case to hold my TomTom and my car charger/plug, but the charger/plug will NOT fit into this case along with the TomTom.  Bottom Line: the case is nice and will do a great job protecting my TomTom, but nothing else will be stored inside.",3,1

"As displayed in the picture, the closure for this case is attached to the left-hand side.  What I didn't pick up on when viewing the image was that this means when you are closing your case, you are wrapping the flap from the front cover to the back - which seems awkward and counter-intuitive.<br /><br />In addition, the interior is black - not colour-matched to the exterior as shown.<br /><br />On the plus side, the Kobo fits snugly inside - no fears of it falling out, and it has a good feel to it.",3,2

"So I've had this case for a while now, and it does its job but I have a few complaints.<br /><br />- It does not protect the screen.<br />- It doesn't fit well with ANY of my accessories that plug into the iPod, except for the iPod connector cable and the input cable on my Dad's BMW.<br />- I take it out from its case and put it back in a lot (because of the aformentioned reason) and at first it was only slightly difficult, but I fear that I might be breaking it because of the plastic dust that's starting to build up a little on the edges, and the way it bends very easily now.<br />- I actually dropped it for the first time the other day from my hand to the bare street (so a couple feet) and the thing burst open and left my iPod on the pavement!<br /><br />+ It does protect very well against minor scratches and pocket warfare with keys and such.<br />+ It fits very well onto the iPod so there is no shaking or rattling of the iPod from within.<br />+ It has not broken despite hard use.<br />+ It is priced very well at about a buck 50.<br /><br />I recommend this to people who only need minor protection and mostly use the iPod as a stand alone product and not too frequently with other electronics, but I do not recommend this for those who tend to be more clumsy or need to often plug their iPod into other things (save for the iPod USB cable).",3,1
"THE SKIN CAME IN EXCELLENT CONDITION.  THE SCREEN PROTECTOR ALWAYS HAD AIR BUBBLES. WASN'T WORTH PUTTING IT ON.  THE BACK BUTTON HAD SOME PROBLEMS BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT WOULD LOOSEN UP SINCE THIS IS MY FIRST TIME PUTTING THE SKIN ON. THE SKIN WAS A LITTLE TIGHT.  THE STAND IS A BIT FLIMSY AND SHAKY.  AND THE BELT CLIP IS QUESTIONABLE, HOW DO YOU PUT THAT THING ON?  OVERALL ITS OK SINCE IT DOES PROTECT THE SCREEN AND THE SKIN FEELS NICE IN THE HAND.  IT'S SMOOTH AND NICE LOOKING.  BAD THING IS THAT IT ATTRACTS DUST.  WOULD RECOMMEND IT BUT YOU GET FOR WHAT YOU PAY FOR.",3,1
"I first thought that the second tab left a paper deposit on the film, but the company responded very quickly to my complaint, and I learned I had made a mistake.  There are 3 films and two tabs.  Pull tab 1 to remove the first film. When you have applied the remaining films to your ipod nano, and pull on the second tab, you must be careful or both the films will come off together; you may think there is only one.  After correct application, I had small bubbles left on mine, but nothing bad enough to affect the view.  The adhesion to the ipod doesn't seem very strong, but I have mine in a sports case which should keep it on.",3,1

Nothing really wrong.  It serves its purpose.  You cannot plug your headphones in until the device is in the pouch.  I don't know that may be common.  Not a tight fit so it seems like it might fit other phones as well.  Velcro is strong and it feels secure on my arm.,3,2
"I had an in-dash radio with Bluetooth in my old car. I traded it for a pickup that had a factory XM radio in the dash. My old stereo had Sirius. Not wanting to clutter the roof with stick-on antennae, but needing Bluetooth, as I am hearing-impaired decided to get the Alpine eX-10. I made a small shelf for it to sit on, along with the remote, hooked it up and tried it out.    Since my stereo has an Aux Input, I wired it directly to the car stereo. I found that the phonebook will not download, a fact that circumvents the hands-free functions of the phone. When I want to make a call, I have to do so manually, using the phone. I make sure I do this when I am not in traffic, and I have memorized the button pushes to make calls to the two places I call most. The phone sounds great and I can have the conversation without holding the phone to my ear. Sometimes when the person on the other end of the conversation hangs up, the eX-10 realizes this and hangs up for me. If I am expecting a call, I have to use the radio in Aux/CD mode. Since CDs are so 90s, I don't use them. If I forget my iPod, I have to listen to road noise until my call is complete. I will probably get a cell phone with mp3 capabilities and will hopefully get rid of this problem.    I mentioned the iPod. It plays through the eX-10 really well. I do with there were buttons on the front of the unit, so that I didn't have to retrieve the remote any time I want to play another song, answer the phone, etc. A short piece of velcro taped to that aluminum shelf I built keeps the remote within reach and at the same place, so I can pick it up without taking my eyes off the road.    All in all, this is a good unit. I was really pampered with the \\""everyone's everything\\"" unit I had before. I am acclimating to the apparent shortcomings of this unit. I can't find another that does Bluetooth and iPod. I'd buy it again.",3,1

"For those reviewers who have commented on magnets destroying their iPods:<br /><br />Magnets have absolutely NO impact on the iPod Touch since the storage is solid state and therefore it does not rely on a mini-disc drive like in the original iPod, which definitely was susceptible to magnetism. Whatever your issues with your iPod Touch are, likely the magnets in the leather case had nothing to do with it.",3,2
"This is an inexpensive set that will bring a nice surround environment  to a small room. I bought this by accident. I prefer a good 2 channel  system for music and movies. This being my first 5.1 with a subwoofer,  I set it up in my bedroom. After an afternoon of experimenting with the  various settings,I finally found it to be adequate for an evening movie.  Start with the basics -  There are three settings for bass - light, normal, and heavy .  There are several EQ presets for different sound ambience, and also   a variety of surround effects settings.Once you find your ideal, or best settings, fine tune the environment by adjusting the sound level for each speaker, and also the 'distance' from the surround(rear) speakers.   What I liked, Pros:   The instruction page was helpful and easy to understand.   The speaker wires are color coded, and each sp. is labeled as to it's location.  The 'light' bass .  Plays PAL discs!  Sound quality is best at low volume.    Cons:  Manually adjusting all the settings can take some time.  The 200 watt designation is misleading,this system is not that powerful.  No built-in TV tuner.  Had some difficulty with recorded DVDRs skipping and stuttering.  Intermittent pauses while reading DVDRs.     Of course, my first inclination was to watch something loud -  I chose a Godzilla movie for the effects, and the system was not up to my   ideal standard of 'feeling' the action.  My second selection was a commercial PAL music video disc.   This is where the sound reproduction improved, and soon realized that   heavy, gut crunching power was not within this units ability.   It is more refined to subtleties in fidelity.  And through all temptation, I found the strength to keep the volume  down in the 'teens'(volume goes 0-40) for a soothing nightcap  of The Fifth Element.    My optimum settings ended up being -  Light Bass,Flat tone,Prologic Movie , and I increased the dB setting for  the two surround speakers by 2 dB each. And decrease the center channel 2dB.Subsequently, I set the distance  for the surround speakers to 12 foot,even though in reality no speaker is more than 5 feet away.    Ideally, the price of this unit should tip the buyer to its potential:  a cheap,basic system .The surprise is the audio - at low volumes.   In summary, if you like to customize your sounds to your tastes, for  'quiet' surround sound to accompany your favorite movie, this is good.  If you can read and follow instructions, and have the patience to fine tune all the settings, this system might be okay for you.",3,1
"Some Issues very hard to make any changes to be saved. Can't download certain app's, colors voices map view everytime you have to make changes cause the save button doesn't save. She wasn't happy.",3,2
"I purchased this case with the idea that it would be a good case to leave my reader in for daily use. While it is a nice, strong case, the system to hold the reader (straps) makes it very hard to keep the reader stable for every day use. Much better suited as a travel case.",3,1
"It does the job, but the quality its kinda s***ty (sorry the word) the plastic cover of the leds detached pretty easy, , the mechanism of the camera that moves up and down, so you can point it the way you like, doesn't work anymore, and stays pointing downwards, so I had to use some adhesive tape for it not to move.",3,2

Save your money, don't get HD until there are some serious improvements.",3,2
"At first glance i was very pleased with this case.  The bottom portion got slightly ripped when I put my zune in the case, even though I did not use too much force.  Two design flaws: Firstly, the arm band was too small and when I run the bottom of the zune moves far too much.  Second, the hole for the headphone jack is far too small... I have separate headphones that I run with, and the hole is not wide enough.  I have found this true with many types of headphones that do not have the straight, in-line jack approach of the headphones that come with the zune.",3,2

"This sleeve is spacious and has plenty of room for my iPad with its protective casing, which is good. I'm just disappointed with the bubble padding inside, the &#34;bubbles&#34; being much smaller than how it is featured in one of the product shots. The &#34;thick bubble&#34; name of this product is actually what attracted me to it in the first place. But it looks like it can provide good enough protection for my tablet so it will still serve its purpose. The graphics design is not as vibrant as it looks in the photo either. Just flat and dull colors (though, not a deal breaker for me).",3,1
It work very good.,3,1
Nook color fits in well.  Has holes in the back for the speaker.  The material it's made from seem ok.  Somewhat padded and should protect the nook ok.  The fold where the case flexes open and close may not hold up to well.  Will have to see.  The cover latch also gets in the way when in landscape mode. Overall an ok product for the price.,3,1
"I was prompted to write a review for this product simply because of the negative reviews from folks who apparently expected really big \\""spectaular\\"" sound from a speaker not much bigger than a chicken's egg! C'mon, boys and girls, be at least a little realistic!! If you purchased one of these and expected it to sound like it came from Bose or JBL, the only person fooling you is YOU!! No, it does not \\""fill the room\\"" with chest-thumping kickin' bass, nor does it sound \\""gigantic\\"" by anyone's standard. However, for a little tiny portable speaker, I have to say it does a credible job for what it is. Realistically, the sound quality is about like what you'd get from a decent portable transistor radio, if you're old enough to remember those.",3,1
"I have 3 ebook readers at home and this is the heaviest (with difference). The readability is quite bad comparing to others. Moreover, when scaling characters, I found that the perfect size (for me) doesn't exist; it is or too big or too small. I would not suggest this reader.",3,2
"I mean, it's a cheap case. I don't know what else you expected from it. I wouldn't buy it again, though.<br /><br />The fake leather material seems to have begun to peel off at the edge where the case folds, and it has torn off pretty dramatically. I'm finding small bits fraying off every few days (note this started just days after owning it), so it's not really something I'm going to keep for long, just until I find another case I actually like.<br /><br />The button that snaps in is a tad bit annoying, too. I have to fiddle with it to make it go in, sometimes more than others.",3,2
"It works, not sure if the pricier version (L2?) will provide any improvement. The only issue i have it is that its cord is way too short. I had to buy an extension cord to use with it. I understand they probably have kept it short to minimize interference and i probably have negated that goal with an extension cord but its just not practical without one.",3,1
"Quite satisfied for the prioce - but modifications were required!.  I had to add speakers with about 20% more oomph!, and I amin quite deperate need of an optional remote control for this unit!. <br /> <br />Otherwise quite good for the price - just don't expect top quality sound although I am quite picky and satisfied. <br /> <br />Only a Treble and Bass control ranging +5 to -5 each.  Additional Bass empahsis options for \\""no Bass\\"", Bass 1\\"" (the best sound quality), and \\""Bass 2\\"" (a little overriding and cloudy sounding). <br /> <br />The switching in shuffle mode between 1 CD to another is a little slow, but comparable to any system in this price range. <br /> <br />No repeat option - but programable nonetheless - although in order to cancel the programing, I have had to eject the CD in order to start over again - haven't consulted the manual though.  I paid $150 CDN, which is about $120 US - as they were pushing them out for the new models purchsed in May 2005.  Quite a bargaiun for the product at that price! <br /> <br />I would recommend this as a suitable product if you aren't plaaning to use it to drive house parties - although it is capable of that in a small house!",3,1

I just recieved this product and when I saw it looked really nice it has a nice style but the problem is that when it comes to pres the home or volume bottoms you have to press hard to be able to touch them it's a nice case but im definetely going to buy another one and the price is too much for this product it should be reduced to at least 5 bucks oh well if you like it you can buy but im not goin to use this case,3,1

"It's a very good item as far as conversation starters go. Everyone I showed had that startled \\""wtf\\"" look on their face lol. Its not impressively loud though.

The big problem is that to carry it with you on a day at the parks, or anywhere, you have to also haul around an iPhone or iPad white long cable with you. This is just not a good thing when you are trying to have as little as possible with you. If there was a way to just connect to iPhone directly it would be an outstanding product. If I am clueless and there is a way around this I hope someone lets me know. If not I am now going to have to find another way to extend my power after spending a lot(for me) on this.",3,1

My iphone case is kind of thick and keeps me from plugging it into many connectors.  Worked fine to extend the connector on my stereo system but not with my 2013 Mercedes dock connector.  It stopped the on-board phone from working until I removed it AND reset the sound system by turning off the motor.,3,2
Only wish it had more power. Other than that it's a decent stereo. I should of paid $25 more. I could of got something 3 times better,3,2

"Didn't come with the HDMI cable.  The quality of the images seemed fine, It was difficult to get into the menu.  The only way I could was by turning the unit on with the sd card class 6 with 16gb not in it.  when I inserted it the unit turns off upon starting it again and pressing menu it would go to menu.  the arrow keys allowed movement to make choices(  OK opened each selection)  OK again approved the selection. Using the reverse key moves to the next selection including date and time set.<br />Cons: the size of the recorded  files varied a lot. There were also pauses in the recording that appear as though slowing way down.  @ the 720 recording level the above card filled-up in about 90min. Nothing I could find or do would allow the unit to overwrite the oldest file so it would not record anything else until I manually removed data from the SD card. This made it worthless to me.  So If you only need it for trips under an hour, it could work well. I did use it as a hand held camera and it worked OK.  I have returned it and ordered another model and will try again, as I really want a dash cam that works.",3,2

"I have two diNovo Edge keyboards that are several years old and the original batteries are starting to fail.  Replacing the batteries doesn't seem to help- fully charged, the setpoint software says the battery will last 5 days- whereas I used to get 60 days with my original batteries.  In actuality I get 2 days, tops.  I requested a replacement battery thinking the one I got was defective, but got the same results.  I also ordered a battery from NewPower99 to see if a different brand would be better, but it wasn't.<br /><br />At this point I think that something in the keyboards themselves is worn out.  I charge my keyboard every night and it will last the entire day- but if I forget to charge it, it will die at some point during the second day.  I try to keep my second keyboard charged as an alternate.  It's a pain but I love these keyboards and haven't found any other keyboard I like as much.

I got this screen protector after a Best Buy rep duped me into buying something other than what I intended. The price is not bad and I got the protector on with no bubbles my 2nd try.

If your old speakers are blown or worn these are great replacements for the price. However if you have a foreign car you might need to buy brackets or modify the ones from your old speakers to make them fit,3,1
"Quality, OK. functionality, OK. Photo reproduction, Could be better, much better. Price. Absolutely to much for what it is. For this price the viewing screen should be 2.7 in. and the resolution should be nothing less then 1080. Shadow areas of picture are very dark. Probably due to screen size. There is no way to adjust picture. The very best that I can do for this product is give it an \\""It's OK\\"" rating. Why do the manufacturers of these products waste their time and money putting an infrared lighting system in any auto cam. This is my second camera and this one does not work one bit better then the last one I had. The light only projects about eight to ten inches (if that much) in front of camera.  Unless this feature projects infrared light at least four to five feet in front of your vehicle, it serves no good purpose that I can find. This projected IR light might work better if only the interior of your car is videoed. The last dash cam that I owned cost $50.00 and was not worth much more that that. It worked all right and produced much better quality pictures and you could at least adjust the screen brightness. Not with this one. The buttons on this unit are much easier to get to. They are very nicely lain out. This model has a 'screen off' feature which I do like very much. Turn the screen off and it looks as if the camera is off, but is still recording. This could come in very handy when dealing with police that now think they have the right to take your camera from you if you are caught videoing their questionable behavior.",3,1

"I purchased this because I have an older one on my boat that directly plug and plays with my Alpine deck.<br />When I recieved this I found that is has to be wired seperately like a traditional amp which was a pain in my truck. SO, I took the old unit (KT-445) out of my boat, installed in my truck by only having to plug it inline with the alpine deck, and then installed this unit into my boat where I had easier acces to all of the wiring. I initially contacted the company and asked if they could give me the other unit (KT-445 vs KT-445U) and was told alpine does not make them anymore. I do not know if this is true but decided to just keep the unit and make it work.<br /><br />The good.<br /> This unit has built in cross overs for both front and rear channels as well as seperate gain controls. The older plug and play style does not. The old unit only has a &#34;hi-low&#34; two position gain switch.<br />This also has RCA inputs which means better sound signal for the amp to use as oppposed to using the high input wires.<br />So over all, this has better options than the older one, I was just expecting to be able to plug it in and not have to pull another power, ground and amp turn on wire.<br /><br />As far as performance, do not expect this to be way louder than the stock deck power. It is only 45 watts. However, The sound is a little louder and MUCH clearer with no distortion at higher volumes",3,1
"After I cut out some of the silicon covering the volume and movent control in the middle of the ipod it was better.

"I like this little lightbulb. Also, it arrived very quickly. The app works fine on my Samsung Galaxy S4 phone. The sound is loud and clear, it can even substitute for your TV speakers (streaming w/ bluetooth). I would have given this an extra star except the light is NOT very bright at all. It cannot fully light a normal-sized room, and perhaps many people won't mind a dimmer room. But I do not recommend using this as a primary lighting source.<br /><br />To sum it all up, this is a nice little functioning device that's a good buy for its price.",3,1

"This is my second dash cam like this.  My previsous one stopped working after it was dropped.  I would advise you not to drop it (obviously), but weather conditions lead me to take it in when I park out doors.  The only thing I can complain about is that this one is a little too sensitive to light (bright roads on sunny days can wash out), and it does OK at night if you are in the city.  Country driving (with no street lights) only shows the illuminated section of the road.",3,1

"I have a mixed review on this item.  It took me some time to evaluate it because I'm not sure how much my own skill set contributed to the results.  First, the item arrived in good condition earlier than I expected.  Second, when I played the cassette player on my stereo  some of my tapes didn't play properly when the auto-reverse switched to side 2(they dragged).  I don't know if this was the tape player or the fact that most of the audio cassette albums I have have been played hundreds of times and are very worn.  Third, when I tried to convert them to MP3's the playback was very choppy.  I found that when I lowered the level of the recording and the rate it was a good bit better(but still choppy).  I'm sure a large part of this may be due to my lack of experience with this kind of recording and it will probably get better with time.  Hence, it is still a work in progress.",3,1
"I bought it through Walgreens mail-only website. Had it been available in-store I think I might have returned it by now. I haven't installed a memory card and played with the multimedia functions (music, video) yet.<br /><br />Pros: Sturdy build, thin, 5\\"" touchscreen, multimedia capable(?), price.<br /><br />Cons: Less user-friendly than my 2 year-old Garmin, hard-drive based internal memory seems to make unit response sluggish at times, battery life not great, screen too dim in daylight.<br /><br />This is the \\""deluxe\\"" model.

"The price for this can't be beat. The silicone cases are great, the headphones work well, and the armband works perfect. The chargers worked, but charge slower than the original usb to pc. The big problem I'm having is the usb sync it comes with won't sync any music, movies, apps, etc. It charges, but no sync. That was the main reason I bought this, and it doesn't work... 3 Stars because everything else works fine. Worth it for the accessories but if you need the sync cable, look elsewhere.",3,1

"I give this three stars not because of the mics themselves, but the extras. The mics are great, and I recommend them for any gigging drummer, or for use in demo recording.<br /><br />Now, I know the cables are a &#34;freebee&#34; as the microphones alone go for $899, but the cables really are garbage with inferior connectors sound quality. The mic stands are adequate and the best part of the add-on's. Headphone, we'll see. Haven't play with them enough yet.<br /><br />Overall, a good deal. I didn't expect the extras to be of high quality, so I'm not terribly disappointed. I do wish the cables were of better quality, but you get what you pay for.<br /><br />As for shipping- very slow via UPS. Everything was in good shape and in working order. However, I must say I'm surprised it made it in one piece. All items were placed into one box that was not strong enough for the weight of the items, plus no padding was added to support the voids created my the various sizes of each item. As a result, the box was crushed and the tape was barely keeping it closed. One would think items totaling $899.00 would be packed with more care.<br /><br />Finally- if you're looking for great drum mics for a good price, these are the ones, with or without the extras.",3,1

"I previously owned a Sharp minicompent system and the CD player quit working. I have been unable to find it from Sharp again, so I bought this RCA system as it was one of the few that had multiple CD playing ability. Compared to the Sharp the speakers have no depth so they don't sound as full bodied (playing either the radio or CD's), but they are okay. The CD changer is very loud, but plays the CD's fine up to this point. This also has no dual/or single cassette capability either which the original Sharp did. Unfortunately these systems are transitional for those of us who still like CD's and cassette's and eventually, they won't even make these anymore.",3,2

"This digital TV was purchased in 2009, and the person who bought it gave it to me as a gift in 2011. Overall, except for the internal battery, the TV works well, and I can receive about 18 channels with some adjustment of the antenna (included with TV) depending on where the towers are located. Setting up this TV is easy. A huge disappointment is that the internal battery will not charge, so I cannot watch TV without using the AC adapter. Maybe this problem is due to the TV having been stored in a new, unused condition for about 1-1/2 years without the battery having ever been charged. Or maybe the internal battery was defective when the TV was purchased. I was really hoping to use the TV without AC power in a power outage or outdoors. The final negative about this TV is that the remote control's battery compartment is extremely difficult to slide open without using a hard tool to force it open. The manufacturer should have made the remote with an easier to open battery compartment.",3,1
"My equipment consists of a Nokia Bluetooth Cell phone and a Garmin Zumo 550 GPS. The Garmin has both bluetooth and MP3 capable.      I have sucessfully interconnected both of these devices through the Bluetooth headset. I can program my GPS to play MP3's - while it is playing, it will cut out to give me my most recent directions from the GPS, if the Cell phone rings, both MP3 and GPS are put on standby, and I can select to receive the call on the screen of the GPS.      Pros: Quite frankly - I am impressed with it's ability to manage my entire onboard communications phone/gps/music. While handling phone calls it is very clear both for me, and for the person I'm talking with (while wearing my helmet) Interconnectivity between passenger and driver is also very clear.    Cons: the stereo quality (playing mp3's) is not close to being good. I was not expecting hi-fi sound, but this is very poor.  It fills in the 'empty spaces' while on a long ride - but that's it. I'm thinking that if I could get the headset part closer to my ears - then it would present a better sound.",3,1

Came early that was good.  Only the top had carpet.  Bottom was painted and  covered in paint runs.  The speakers were held in with 4 screws instead of using all the screw holes witch would cause an air leak.  It fit fairly well.  Sticks out about a half inch past the seat.  Sounds decent.  The subs are single voice coil not dual like the add said.  It's ok for the money. I would have gave it a 5. Had they put pride in their work and not left runs and screwed the subs in completely,3,2

"As a buyer of well-over 300 Baofeng radios (and counting) for the group I belong to (not all of which were purchased through Amazon but many were), I'm always amazed at the lengths some sellers go to to hype their products as being \\""newer\\"" or \\""better\\"" than other models, or perhaps (to give them the benefit of the doubt) they just don't know any better.<br /><br />First, the Baofeng UV-5R series (including the original and still extremely popular UV-5R, I'll explain why in a minute) is what is normally referred to by many as a SDR radio (or software defined radio).  While not a true SDR product (you can't use it with your computer to control the radio's functions or scan a wide amount of VHF/UHF frequencies with it), none the less a large chip is programmed on the circuit board built inside each radio.  That chip determines what capability the radio itself can perform.<br /><br />Every UV-5R series radio has the ability to transmit from 136-174 MHz on VHF and from 400-520 MHz on UHF in both narrow-band and wide-band modes (very useful for the occasional FRS or MURS use, which requires narrow-band mode to work correctly).<br /><br />Every model does \\""at least\\"" 4W on VHF/UHF from the factory, but occasionally you'll get a batch that does 4.5W or even 5W out, but the difference between 4W and 5W is minimal at best.  A 4W radio with a better antenna will easily outperform a 5W radio with the standard crappy antenna that Baofeng ships on ALL (including the UV-5RA, -5RAX, and -5RAX+) models.<br /><br />Baofeng DOES NOT program those chips any differently for the UV-5R vs. any other UV-5R series (including the UV-5RAX+).  Version 307 of the firmware (which is the most current release I have in any of my radios) works EXACTLY the same way as previous older releases of firmware at least back to the 295 release (over a year ago), so any claim from a seller that this release provides additional features (at least from a user's perspective) is simply BOGUS, since the firmware inside both radios have the same features.  In fact, my UV-5R radios with the 307 firmware release is EXACTLY the same radio (inside and within the firmware) as my UV-5RAX+ radios with the 307 firmware release.<br /><br />Second, you CANNOT in any way upgrade the firmware (unless you count buying a different radio and it comes with a different firmware release), so again the claim in the listing from some sellers that you can is simply BOGUS.<br /><br />Third, you can believe that two thinner pieces (glued or screwed together on the faceplate of the UV-5RAX+) is somehow stronger than one thicker piece of plastic (on the original UV-5R series) if you like (and maybe it is), but I haven't seen that in real-world use from my own UV-5RAX+ units.  The standard UV-5R units that we use seem to hold up just as well (when dropped in the desert dirt or rolling down a hill) as any other Baofeng radio we own and use.<br /><br />Fourth, and my biggest issue with all of the non-standard UV-5RAX and UV-5RAX+ units, is that NONE of the Baofeng battery accessories (except the little 1800 mAh standard battery) work WITHOUT modification (unless you use a Dremel tool to grind or cut off part of your extended battery that works on the standard UV-5R - but won't work on your UV-5RA, UV-5RAX or UV-5RAX+).<br /><br />Getting new UV-5RAX+ units that don't work with Extended 3800 mAh batteries (without modification) doesn't make my group happy.  That may not bother you, but NONE of the sellers of the non-standard UV-5RA, UV-5RAX, and UV-5RAX+ units ever seem to mention that lack of hardware compatibility in their listings, so buyer beware!<br /><br />BTW, NONE of the \\""AA\\"" or \\""AAA\\"" battery shell packs work on the UV-5RA, UV-5RAX, or UV-5RAX+ units either, so that's 3 different battery accessories (including the 3800 mAh extended battery) that you can't use on these radios without hacking them with a Dremel tool (but they all work without modification on the original UV-5R units).<br /><br />So\\""if\\"" you want a \\""pretty\\"" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (or -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.  Oh, you should see how well that shiny faceplate lights up when a flashlight hits it in the dark, just the thing you don't want for night use.<br /><br />Virtually every guy in our group ends up carrying a standard UV-5R and giving the UV-5RA, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ to the wife or kids, since the wife and/or kids rarely care about the other accessories working and they (the wife and kids) tend to like the \\""pretty\\"" radios, but again there is NO INTERNAL difference and NO EXTRA FEATURES in the UV-5RA, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ units (other than a different looking shiny faceplate) vs. the UV-5R (which I refer to as the M16 of radios, as all accessories you match it up with just plain work).<br /><br />Now you know the real background on these radios.\\""if\\"" you want a \\""pretty\\"" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (or -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.

"I bought this CD player after purchasing a similar iPod compatible Kenwood for my wife.  My hope was that this would be a superior product.  Unfortunately, in spite of spending almost $100 extra, I got let down.  I will try to tell you why the Alpine isn't as good as the Kenwood without sounding like I'm getting paid by Kenwood to sell something.      As a radio and cd player, it is fine.  I use it primarly as a player for my iPod so that's how I will review this.    The \\""fancy\\"" display doesn't seem that fancy.  A large portion of the screen is taken up by a giant icon which could have been removed to provide more space for song text.      The biggest issue I have with this player is the ability to search through songs.  There was a HUGE failure by Alpine in not providing analog scroll speed on the wheel.  Essentially, if you search through your song list, the number keys will take you to a predetermined spot on the list.  I was confused by this when I purchased it.  I assumed that, for example, 1 would skip down 5% of the list every time you hit it, and 2 would skip down 10%, etc. This would have been a good design feature. This is not the case.  1-6 always takes you to a present percentage of your list.  If you have 100 songs then 1 would always take you to song 15 and 6 would always take you to song 85 (not sure of the exact percentages, but the example is correct).      For someone with 100 songs this would probably be acceptable.  For someone with 1000 songs, it is not.  For someone with even more, it becomes increasingly absurd.  If you want song 1789 and 4 takes you to 1600 and 5 takes you to 1890, you've got A LOT of songs to scroll through.      Normally this would not be a problem, because the developers would build logic into the scroll wheel to buzz through the list fast when you spin it fast and slow when you spin it slow, similar to how the ipod works.  Not so at all!  You get approximately 2-3 songs scrolled per second.  That means for 100 songs you'll be spinning that wheel for 30-50 seconds.  For 200, it is 60-100 seconds.  Absolutely absurd.    This has changed how I listen to music.  Normally I would listen to my music on shuffle, and then occasionally search for a song that for whatever random reason I wanted to hear.  Once that song was done, the shuffle resumes and I am happy.  Now because searching for a specific song is FAR too costly on time, I have to either search for the artist to find the song (still takes too long) then manually resume shuffle after it is over or (more often than not) just ignore my urge and continue listening to shuffle.      The kenwood I bought my wife has a direct search feature where you can search by title, artist, album, etc. You can put in as many characters as you want and then hit search and it returns a filtered list.  So you can search for songs starting with R, or songs starting with RO, or songs starting with ROB, etc.  This is a very fast and intuitive way to search for songs, far superior to the Alpine.  It does require more \\""attention\\"" and therefore is not safe to do while driving, but it is FAST enough to do while at a stoplight.  And it still retains the static scrolling ability that the Alpine offers.    Another feature that bugs me is the Alpine ignores \\""Skip When Shuffling\\"" when listening to a group of songs.  If you shuffle the whole song list, it correctly recognizes and skips songs you've marked (I don't want to hear audiobooks when I shuffle my playlist).  However, if I listen to a group of songs (for example, all songs by some artist), any that I've marked as \\""Skip When Shuffling\\"" will play whether I'm shuffling through them or not.  If you start playing the song group on your iPod THEN connect it to the stereo, it will play the correct songs.  Otherwise, it won't.  For most people this probably won't be an issue but it boggles my mind why Alpine would ignore a built-in setting of the iPod in one mode while recognizing and following it in another.    Thelast annoying feature I will talk about is that the song list is sorted not by song title, but by artist!  That means that AC\DC - Thunderstruck will show up near the top, while Tool - Aenema will show up at the bottom.  This may have made sense if the song names were all preceded by the artist, but not so.  They show up as just the song titles.  Again, mind boggling.  Not only do you have to figure out alphabetically where an artist is in order to locate a song, you have to constantly be thinking about the artists who wrote the songs around what you are searching for in order to figure out where on the list you are.      The song info often takes a little bit to pop up on the display when you are listening to tracks, and sometimes (more frequently than rarely) it doesn't display anything at all.  It is an intermittent error because I can go back a few songs and then forward back to the same track and it will display correctly.      This unit was compatible with my 30GB iPod video.    I do highly recommend someone who is using an FM transmitter to get something like this.  I used one for years and it drove me crazy.  Poor sound quality, static when it rained, searching for stations when traveling, all huge headaches.  These little things are really great solutions to all those problems.      But, the Alpine, while very nice, is not worth the price IMO.  I much prefer my wife's Kenwood Excelon.",3,2
"Just got these in the mail today. They come in Apple packaging, but there is no way the cables are made by Apple. The printing of the symbols on the plastic is cheap and rubs off.

The dock connector side plastic is a bit wider than Apple's actual version. It works, and was only a few bucks so I am not complaining, but just wanted to warn people if they want an actual Apple product...this is not it.",3,2

I've tried inserting and taking out the Kindle three times so far, but I've stopped for fear I'm tempting fate on the skin. I don't understand why M-Edge couldn't add a quarter of an inch of allowance; it can't be that much of added fabric/expense, and would ease taking out the Kindle while still keeping it held in. I've decided to only use it when I'm going out and put the Kindle in the original box when I'm at home. Also, the smell of the glue is very strong, but it's not noxious odor (I could see someone getting high on it). I'm going to let it air out, and hopefully, the odor will dissipate with use. I do like that the top and bottom are of solid and firm material to protect the screen and the backside.  Also, the inside is lined with a microfiber-type cowhide-ish fabric. From all my research, this is the best one for my purposes, except for the snugness, which I hope will loosen with more use of the sleeve.",3,1
"I tend to use my Zune HD at places such as work that do not always have access to a computer USB port. This kit was cheap so I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />  The USB cable works like a charm and allows charging, and syncing through your computer without any connection issues of any sort.<br /><br />  The wall and car charger are definitely the low end of this kit. When plugged into the wall or car charger the Zune will play music if it is already playing but for some reason (I think the Zune thinks it is docked and wants a remote to be used?) the screen stops being responsive to touch. It does however charge the Zune and does not seem to damage it. I ended up using it as a night time charger that way I won't have to try and mess with the screen and such.<br /><br />  The cases are okay. Nothing super great about them but nothing too bad either. They seem to protect the Zune itself pretty well and has a slot on the back so you can turn it into an armband.<br /><br />  I cannot rate the screen protector yet as I already have one on it. If I end up replacing it with this screen protector I will update with the results.",3,1
Product was a little cheaply put together. Brought us a lot of smiles though as it was for a 1.5 yr old and it was entertaining. Shipping costs were expensive!,3,2
This product was good overall for the price and it fits fine. I have only used it one time since it purchased it and will have to try it a few more times to make sure it doesn't slip down my arm when I am working out.,3,1
"After installing this, it took me a couple of days to diagnose the problem. The washer that comes with this mounting kit that fits between the coax attachment and the mounting plate fit so tightly that it was shorting out the antenna stud.<br /><br />Once I removed this washer, the antenna works perfectly.<br /><br />It would be nice if this can with some kind of instructions. I figured out where all the washers and gaskets go, but I don't think the average Joe would know. (Then again, given the short I got from the washer, maybe I *didn't* get it right.)<br /><br />Also, 2 of the 4 mounting bolts were bent and unusable on arrival. Not too big of a deal as I used my own hardware, but still.",3,1
The case wasn't all that good it's not protective around the side so if it falls on the face it'll still crack and it's extremely hard to get off...,3,2
"This is okay, but doesn't hold up to bumps like knees or elbows very well, wish it was metal.",3,1
I HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS ITEM IS OK. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE REMOTE CONTROL AND THE COSTUMER SERVICE. I TRY TO GET A REPLACEMENT OF THE CONTROL... I NEVER GOT A RESPONSE FROM THIS SELLER...,3,2
The listen up did not live up to its expectations.  It's hard to see whether it is on or off as the light stays on all the time.,3,1
These are ok.  Not great for dark hair - they blend in.,3,1
"This armband is OK.  I haven't seen/used others so do not have a lot to compare it to, but there were several issues with it.  It wears rather comfortably on the arm, but wouldn't fit an overly large upper arm.  The opening that the player slides into has no strap to lock it in and there is no easy access to the player function keys once it's inserted--in fact, to plug in the earbuds on the Sony Walkman, we had to slip the player into the armband upside down.  If you want an inexpensive armband to walk or jog while not changing your choice of tunes once started and don't care that it's upside down to use earbuds, this is fine.  If you are doing more active exercise, there might be a chance for the player to come loose (it is in tight, but not secured) and you cannot easily change your playlist without removing the unit.",3,2
2nd item I bought along with charger and i can finally rest that my gps wont get lost or damaged.<br />again great price and a sleek color.,3,1
Alright for price. cheap wires but recovered new ones on. very bright. needs crossover,3,1
"The item does hold the phone securly, but the suction cup does not stay on windshield very well. good for the price but if you are looking for something more durable, maybe pay a little more for something better.",3,2
"After a week of use, the rubber protection from the mouse to the cord broke off.  *Note* that I am not an aggressive user with technology and take pride in taking care of my tech. Before this mouse I had a $15 Microsoft mouse that lasted me three years no problems.",3,2
"I bought this as another way to hold my iPod hands-free at work and school, and the screen protector. Im gonna be frank, I didn't like the screen protector, couldve been better. The pouch was a nice idea, but is very very cheap, and falls apart within 2 months of everyday usage. I like the screen cleaner, but eh...Better off with a another order.",3,2
"It had taken me two tries to get it on straight so instead have two left, I only of one. But once the product was on my Galaxy.<br />It did it's  job",3,1
Not as durable as I had hoped.  Started showing signs of wear  right away and didn't last very long.  I have found better quality for less $$ elsewhere.,3,2
"I ordered two of these, and one didn't work out of the box.<br /><br />The one that worked is ok.  Not as good as my old Brookstone charger, which was smaller, was connected directly to iPhone and somehow charged faster. But this one did the job, I used it so far.<br /><br />I would give this 4 stars, if both units that I ordered would worked.  I contacted the seller by email and they were very responsive.  Nevertheless, they told me to ship it back myself, and later they would refund my shipping charges.  I decided that I won't be wasting an hour to my time doing my own shipping for $15 product.  The seller should provide prepaid return labels, in which case I could give package back to UPS or USPS driver, without waisting my time going somewhere.<br /><br />Flashlight is ok, but honestly this is not a huge value-add from my point of view, since new iPhone flashlight feels at least as powerful, if not more.",3,2
"I don't have an aux-in installed in my car so I purchased this product in order to listen to the songs on my phone without draining the battery. Everything works, but with my Samsung Epic there is a high-pitched buzz in the background when both the charger and the transmitter are plugged in. I had the same buzzing with another charger, so I think it's probably my phone or my specific setup, but this buzz makes it impossible to listen for more than about 10 minutes which defeats the purpose of the dual charger/transmitter. Hopefully it will work better for others.",3,2
"I've had this speaker for about a year and loved it at first. It worked perfectly, had great sound and stayed charged for a long time. After having it a year, I'm a lot less enthused. The speaker has started to fall apart, the silver band and the top part with the grill have started to come off. I've been careful with it, it's never been dropped, but now when you pick it up, you have to make sure those two pieces are held together. The audio cable has a short in it and if you don't set the speaker on top of it JUST RIGHT then you're not going to have any sound at all. The sound was great when I bought it, but now that it's coming apart it's got a lot of annoying rattle on the lower end. Also, there are 3 rubber feet on the bottom. Two of those had fallen off within a couple months of purchase. If you're looking for something that sounds great at first, and you don't mind replacing it after 8 or so months, get this speaker. If you want something that's gonna last longer, I'd suggest you look elsewhere. If you find something good, let me know.",3,1
It's not the best quality and it's a little difficult to scroll around with while looking for music. Also mine shuts off randomly sometimes.,3,2
"I feel like this is a really good cassette  but when I first got it,  charged it  up it only lasted 40 45 seconds before popping back out of my cassette  player. I think that it might be my cassette players  fault,  I never had any problems connecting it with other devices.",3,1
I got this for my children's room. It gives great sound for the space and the option to connect the IPOD/IPHONE is great.,3,1
"I really liked this case when it came in. If you don't have anything to add to it, it will work as is. I have an i-pod with video, plastic case with a belt clip for i-pod, home charger, usb cable, headphones and a soft sleeve plus the accessories that came with this case. I did get everything in the case but cannot zip it all the way closed. I also had to remove the belt clip from my plastic case and store them apart in order to be able to keep them in this travel case. Since this is a travel bag, I thick it should be made larger to hold all accessories a person might own for an i-pod. A lot of money for so little room.",3,1
It doesn't fit in my fathers key as I expected. But it is a very nice and good looking key replacement.,3,1
If I had to do over again I would have bought a different product all together. This product might be good to read your ebooks on but other than that it's too slow for my taste. I bought this for my 17 year old daughter and wish that I hadn't because to me it was a waste of money!,3,2
"For a couple of bucks I figured it was worth a try. It surprised me how long it's lasted, but the sound quality absolutely sucks, no bass and on any station it is static-y.",3,1
"I had to replace my old remote after 6 years. When I got the new one there was a battery inside that didn't work. It didn't bother me since I had extras and wasn't expecting a battery to come with it anyways. However, the back button stopped working after two weeks of use. Oh well, stuff happens.",3,2
"Ok box, but hard to find the proper sub that would meet specifications",3,1
"This purchase includes:<br /><br />1. The case itself, which covers everything but the top, bottom, wheel, and camera lens, and has an attachment for a lanyard if you want<br />2. A small microfiber cloth<br />3. A stick-on screen protector<br />4. Bag for your iPod, although the bag is way bigger than necessary<br /><br />I would recommend cleaning both your iPod and the case very well before you put the case on, because once you get it on, it's VERY difficult to get off. Another problem was the screen protector. It would've been great as additional protection if the sticker on it actually peeled off nicely. Instead, it left a sticky residue that made the screen protector useless, unless you don't mind white pieces of sticker in front of your screen.",3,2
This unit was good while it lasted. Be prepared to throw it away after 6 months use (which was better than the last unit I had from another manufacturer as that one lasted only lasted a month).,3,2
"It appears to be good, but I'm still waiting for my other items radio,batteries,charger, before I can go to 4 or 5 stars",3,1
This is a nice case but don't plan on putting much else in it.  There isn't even room for a charger.,3,2
"One dead on arrival, one working as intended.",3,2
"This provides plenty of light, but there are some drawbacks.    Drawback #1: This thing has four modes: White Spotlight, White Floodlight, White Spot plus Flood, Red, and OFF. The selection is made by pressing one switch over and over. This is a pain, especially since the switch is small and rather stiff. With gloves on it's almost impossible. It also means that to get to the night vision friendly RED you've got to step through 3 WHITE settings.    Drawback #2: The LED's are not recessed and don't have reflectors to direct the light forward. I wear glasses and the stray light hits my glasses and makes it almost impossible to see. I later \\""fixed\\"" this by painting the lower portion of the assembly with black car touch-up paint. This greatly reduced the stray light problem.    Before I purchased the 6 LED model I had the 3 LED model. Other than not beeing as bright, it is a better design because it has a 3 position slider switch...center OFF, left RED, right WHITE. So, if you want RED, you go straight to RED. Also, the LED's are recessed a bit and don't throw nearly as much light into my face as this 6 LED model did.    Note that I just saw a new Energizer head lamp that seems to fix the stray light problem. It has a high power LED with reflector for the spot light, the but the unit is rather bulky. Unfortunately, it looks to have the same crappy push-button switch design as this one.    As of the date of this review, the picture is that of the 3 LED lamp. I advised Amazon of the error but they said it was fine as is. Whatever.",3,1
A little glitches at first with screen just displaying color bars when in record mode. Night lights are not very good either. But after set up up it works well for what I bought it for. Not a bad purchase for 30 some then dollars.,3,2
my daughter loves it but it's not very well made. It comes apart very easily and she's pretty gentle on her iPod.,3,1
"I really didnt think it would be this BIG but dear god IT IS, but sturdy and well made...but damn its BIG",3,1
"A little noisy because of the fan.  Pretty large, won't fit in one car because the shifter is in the way.  Both the USB and 120V ports work well.  Two years later they still work perfectly",3,1
I am giving this a 3 star due to the fact that I do not know if it works well or not. I have a former police car and I did not realize prior to ordering this that the keyless entry is disabled on my car.. It did not work with my Crown Vic and if yours is a former police car you may want to pass on this.,3,2
"Meh. You get what you pay for. It'll do, but I'll probably end up getting rid of it at some point. The nano is convenient enough with it's clip that it's not worth the hassle of squeezing my arm through the band",3,2
"It is OK for listening the music but not supports any video file format. Can't watch anything on this thing, I tried all formats .",3,2
The protector was relatively easy to install and bubble free.  The matte screen does cut down on the glare but I'm not a fan of the change in screen responsiveness after applying the screen nor the cloudy/milky look it leaves and it is still a finger print magnet.  I'm going to find something else and replace all three TouchPad screens that I applied the splash Masque film on.,3,2
$15.00 is what you get,3,1
"They were ok, but enjoy using the product.",3,1
"It has saved my iPads life many times but dust gets in the back and scratches the ipad it also gets dirty and the dirt sticks,but im sure its the same thing with this type of case.Overall its okay.",3,1
"This unit does an excellent job of neatly holding your iPod and providing power and a wireless solution(via FM signal to your radio)to play in your car and/or boat.  I love everything about it as I can use it to hold my iPod, satellite radio or other car accessories. I love the fact that it supports every FM frequency. My only complaint is the FM transmitter exhibits a squeal.  It's not bad enough to drown out your music but it's noticeable, particularly in quiet passages.  If you use it to listen to talk radio on your satellite radio, you will find it annoying.",3,1
"After 5 months of use this case was destroyed. It is not meant to handle every day usage. I enjoy reading. My kindle goes in my purse or my book bag, but it is with me everyday. I read series after series. Since buying this case 5 months ago I have read all three &#34;Hunger Games&#34; books, &#34;The Alchemist&#34;,  The &#34;Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire&#34; , a short book in the &#34;Unwind&#34; series that ties books 1 and 2 together (1.5 something like that) and 3 out of 4 books in the &#34;Unwind&#34; series.",3,2
nice package for my son for christmas he loved having the arm band and new screen protector he enjoyed the set very much,3,1
"I used this walkie talkie in harsh environments such as construction, building maintenance and on rooftops in blazing heat and extreme cold.  I was able to communicate with my other party from my rooftop to his car which was approx. two and a half miles so my wave pattern was basically un obstructed.  It did perform well in buildings (I transmited and received verbal messages from the basement of a building with metal beams) between two or three floors depending on where the doors or windows were when I sent or received messages.  The lower channels did better when I worked around power tools but they all were disturbed by the operation of the frequencys those tools create.  I don't know if they perform better around 12VDC tools.  In extreme conditions such as high heat or sub zero weather, it would be best to keep your walkie talkie insulated.  I kept mine inside of a large polyester fill mitten with the antenna sticking out from my front pocket.  A chest pocket on a vest would be even better because body heat is greater around the heart.<br /><br />  In extreme heat such as on a high roof top I would keep it in a canvas sleeve that is painted light green or white to reflect the heat away from the unit.  In situations where it was exposed to paint, sheetrock dust, or any other debries, I would simply wrap a plastic shoping bag around it or use blue or green painters tape to keep paint and other dust out of the buttons and speaker areas as well as the ventalation holes for the electronics within.  I hope this is useful to you.",3,1
"It was hard enough finding a case for my iPod Touch that wasn't almost thirty dollars. I suppose you get what you pay for when you play it cheap. This case fits my Touch, but I had to literally whack it a bit to REALLY make it fit. Something about the top corners that just would NOT close, and I wasn't having it. I made it fit. There's still a tiny gap, so I'm guess this is an imperfect mold or something. Sometimes you get a good fit, sometimes you don't. It's not all bad, but I'm sure this thing will come flying apart the moment I get clumsy and drop it. Does not appear to be rubberized, and has more of a hard outer shell. This is a temporary fix until I find another....",3,2
The case was fine but the color is mislabeled. The color is not metallic pink; the color is more purple and is not metallic/sparkly.,3,2
has a decent charge rate and is really useful. just the flashlight is on most all the time so it kills itself. its weird how it just randomly turns on.,3,1
"The band is comfortable, but not big enough for a guy who has larger-than-average arms.  I got this for my boyfriend and he wore it about four times before the velcro ripped off.  The front protective cover works well with the touch-screen on the iPod and the hole to access the headphones port is convenient.  Overall, a good product for women and men who run, but do not work their biceps much!",3,1
"Overall, this cover does what it is supposed to do: it protects your Kindle Fire's screen and reduces the glare - in my case, it helps stop a lot of the smudgy fingerprints as well as the glare / reflection of the overhead lights in my office.<br /><br />Before you install it on your Fire, let me point out a couple of things:<br /><br />1. Clean your Fire's screen with the soft cloth that comes with the screen protector. DO NOT use water to assist you, but use a gentle wiping motion with the cloth. Why? You don't want to put the cover over a bunch of fingerprints and have your fingerprints memorialized on your Fire!<br /><br />2. Make sure you use the straight-edge that comes with it, or a credit card, to help smooth out the bubbles.<br /><br />3. Be patient, line it up, and go slow! This cover doesn't have much wiggle-room to be slightly off - if you go just a fraction at an angle to one side, you will start covering the Fire's edge case vs. the screen. If that happens, slowly back it up and start again. Maybe that's why they included two to the package.<br /><br />Now, for the annoyance factor - no matter what I do, there are still areas along the edges where the air just won't come out no matter how much you apply the straight edge.  While it is not on the viewable screen portion, it is still distracting.<br /><br />Overall, this is not too bad and does what it is supposed to do.  It is a little pricey as compared to the screen covers for a regular Kindle, but I would rather have a screen protector vs. a scratched up Kindle Fire that doesn't have one!",3,2
"The product fit my ipod perfectly, but the zebra part was just a cheap sticker put on the back and was a bit wrinkled.",3,1
Antennae broke soon after purchasing.,3,2
"Was initially very pleased.  Rugged.  Feels well in the hand.  Excellent base.  Funky keyboard layout.  Overall, appeared to be an excellent product for the cost.<br /><br />However, the UHF receive drops about 2 seconds into the transmission.  Highly annoying, especially with scanning.  I have not heard of other people having the problem, so likely just the one I got.  Will be exchanging.",3,1
Nice product,3,1
"I bought this device for my bicycle, thinking it would let me free explore more easily because I could always get home!  The reality is somewhat less exciting.  Because of the way the GPS unit itself is constructed, that is the springs and how strong they are, I don't believe this or any device which leverages those springs around the circular back's circumference are fit for a bicycle.  The 'holding power' of the mount isn't strong enough for the shocks transmitted to it from the road.  The GPS will be dislodged by a bump as small at 3 inches if your speed exceeds 10 MPH.  The mount works to hold the GPS but it isn't secure.  would recommend some kind of backup 'String' or \\""Rope\\"" or else your GPS will go skittering down the street like my did.    Good Luck.",3,1
"The speakers are compact and save space, but the sound was not clear and at a moderate volume started to distort. There is no equalizing control unless using the usb/sd card function, and at that there are only presets which was annoying. The remote feels cheap and trying to make use of the buttons on the subwoofer was a bit frustrating. This product is for someone looking for simple computer speakers, though I felt the product should've been more for the price.<br /><br />However, the seller was very helpful and I had no problems with them.",3,2
A little larger than I would  have liked but it weill do the job,3,1

"It does its job, however the audio quality does suffer. If you have AC built into your stereo, it will not automatically adjust audio levels for background noise. I use it in a pinch.",3,1
Is what it states. Accessories can be used for other electronic devices.,3,1
Its noy a polk but it does a good job,3,1
"The cases were fine, though nothing to write home about.<br />They fit pretty well for the most part, but there is room for improvement.<br />Also the material is a little sticky so be prepared to pull hair, dirt, and other debris off of it.",3,1
"Okay, so I knew when I decided to purchase this thing that it was really cheap.  But I had hopes that it would work anyhow.  So today we got it and plugged it in.  I had to work a bit to get the plug into just the right position but not too much.  Then we could not hear any music even though my iphone said it was playing and I had it on the right FM frequency.  We finally figured out that it was playing when we turned the car stereo unit to the highest possible volume.  However, it only worked if I did not plug in the charging jack that is supposed to make it so the phone will charge while playing.  If that part was plugged in the result was no music.  So we brought it back indoors and I looked at the shipping paperwork.  That told me that it can only be returned if the package is unopened!  Now, how am I supposed to know before I try it if the product will work or not?  I am very disappointed!    Revised review:  Well, I finally got it to work.  You have to ignore the little wire that comes in the box.  Without the wire the unit plays just fine.  And the charging jack worked also.  However, there are NO instructions anywhere in the package and I think this is a HUGE problem.  It is so easy to include simple instructions that it makes no sense to have not done so.  For that reason I am only raising my number of stars from 1 to 3.",3,2
"Mine didn't work as it was supposed to.  It would charge my phone just fine, but only for 1-2 minutes.  After that it would stop charging until I pressed the button again.  Once I pressed the button, I had another 1-2 minutes of charge time until it would stop again.  I wondered if maybe my phone was doing something funny that made the device think it was all charged up and made it stop, but I tried with several other devices with the same result.<br /><br />I tried to contact support via their website, but never got any response.....  It's a great concept, and I love the high capacity, but I really wish that it would work properly.  $50 is expensive for a lemon :(<br /><br />-----------------<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />So I was cleaning out the garage and I found this again.  I'm stubborn and I wanted it to work so I kept trying.  When I tried using it in the past, it was a windows mobile device that I was trying to charge.  Trying to charge a couple android devices gave pretty much the same result as before (i.e. it didn't work!).  I tried plugging in someone's ipod, and I couldn't believe it when it gave a charge!  This lead me to realize that the device is wired to charge i-devices.<br /><br />I don't remember the specifics of how it works, but basically when the device is plugged into USB it wants to talk to the computer to negotiate what to do or how much power to pull.  Since this is a dumb charger, it can't negotiate with the device.  USB has four wires; two for power and two for data.  The solution with dumb chargers is that the two data wires are connected together.  This makes it so the device knows it can't negotiate with a computer and can pull as much power as it wants.  Problem solved!  Unfortunately, apple devices and chargers don't do this the same way.  To make this work with your android device, you can either open it up and solder the two middle pins together on the USB port, or you can buy(?) or make a USB cable with the wires crossed.<br /><br/>Take a USB cable that fits your device (I recommend an extra, not the one you use all the time!).  Somewhere in the middle of the cable, strip off the plastic coating to expose the four wires.  The hard part is figuring out which wires to cut.  It's just like trying to diffuse a bomb on TV, except you probably won't die if you choose the wrong ones.  With my cable it was pretty easy, the power wires were red and black, and the other two wires were green and yellow or something.  Leave the power wires as they are, and cut the two other wires.  Connect the two data wires together on the side that leads to your phone or device, and leave the other ends alone.  Wrap it back up with electrical tape and try it out.  If you connected the right wires, it should work now!!<br /><br />So now that I know that it works, I'll upgrade my review to 3 stars.  I believe that a charger that comes with the data wires shorted together can still charge apple devices (like my car charger) so there really is no reason to make a charger that doesn't have these wires shorted because it severely limits what you can do with it.  It's a simple fix for the factory, but is a pain if you have to fix it yourself.",3,2
"I bought a Holux GPSlim240 over 18 months ago.  It was my first GPS unit.  Initial impression were very favorable.  Pairing with my Nokia E61 was easy and bluetooth range was adequate at about 20-25 feet (E61s tend to have very poor wifi and bluetooth ranges; I would not be surprised if another phone got significantly greater range).  Battery life fell far short of the manufacturer's claims:  4-5 hours on a good day.  Primary usage was in the southern U.S., and it could reliably see 8-12 sats from inside a car or on foot.    Inexplicably, it performed terribly on a trip to Europe.  Acquisition time was often way up (no waas/egnos?) and sometimes it could only fix 3-4 sats even with a clear sky view.    By far the worst complaint however, is the lack of support from Holux corporate for their products.  The battery in my unit recently failed, requiring external power to operate.  No problem I thought, I'll just message holux for the battery part number, order a replacement part online and swap the battery.  It wasn't even soldered in.  Holux steadfastly refused to provide the part number or any other useful information, insisting that I get support from the retailer (yeah right-i got it off ebay..).  The battery itself has no identifying information at all, which is unusual.  The GPS itself began malfunctioning not long after that, rendering the issue moot.      My advice if you buy a gps from holux: get one with a user-replaceable battery, because once you buy their products you are on your own.",3,2
"Very convenient if your battery cannot hold a good charge and you don't want to spend that extra change on a recharging case, but after about a year of use, it does not hold a full charge any longer",3,2

I bought this item as the replacement speakers for my lexus IS. I was very dissapointed. They did not deliver the base i expected. I now use them for voice and mid base in my system.

"Just got the package and opened it and as easy as these may be to install I will have to search all over the internet to find out how to. Because the directions were apparently in another language and then very poorly translated. Also I am still not sure they will work in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee although the poles are both round, the ones on the Jeep have notches to lock them in place for desired height and the headrest poles don't even though one of the pictures on the box it looks like they do.",3,1
"I like the color, texture, and features of this case.  There's a sleeve for your business card or ID; a pocket for a slender notepad or some notepaper; and a place to slip a pen or pencil.  It's made of decent materials, and I do consider this case to be a pretty good value.  However, I wish they had included a snap or something to hold the Nook in place at the top.  I'm always afraid that I will accidentally pick it up by the wrong end.  If the Nook was held in place at the top, I wouldn't worry about it slipping out and being broken. I deducted a star because I consider that to be a flaw.",3,1
"I liked the picture of it, when i put it on my nook, it looked amazing !!!<br />the only thing is that it's slippery, even inside of my cover(Leather Case with Stand for Barnes & Noble Nook Color, Purple(NOT GOOD INVESTMENT)) i have to be really carefull to not let my nook fall of. I've also noticed that no matter how hard i press, the corners will just not stay put, so it makes me think that with time it will peel off.<br />But nice look",3,1

"I like this cover, especially that you can prop up the Kindle to read at the table, but the bottom straps, which hold the front of the cover to the back wear out quickly. I've had it about 4 months, and I already need to buy a new cover because of this issue. For this price tag, it should last longer.",3,1
"this case looked great, and it protects my ipod, but it was hard to get on, it wont come off without breaking and you need to use a knife to get it off in the first place, and the paint chips off so i have to go over it with a sharpie.  it gets three stars because of the looks and protection.",3,1
"I brought the Teach Hi-Fidelity from Costco today for $39 a very good price. Unfortunately I plan on returning it. <br /> <br />The good: <br />1. Excellent price. <br />2. Sounds very good, with good base for the size and price. <br />3. My iPod Video fit perfectly and sounded good. <br />4. The controls where fairly easy to figure out. <br />5. Bright and big clock screen. <br />6. Remote very handy and a surprise at such a low price. It even had basic iPod controls. <br /> <br />The bad (deal breaker): <br />1. I had trouble getting good AM or FM reception. Only a few stations came in without a lot of static. I tried several locations. This was the primary reason I brought for better sounding FM. <br />2. The clock was very bright even when dimmed - would be an issue when trying to sleep. <br /> <br />Final Comments: <br />I might return it for another unit to see if I get better reception. The problem is the clock is so bright even if I can tolerate it, my wife will probably complain it's too bright. <br />",3,1

"I bought this for my new GPS, a Garmin nüvi 1350LMT (which BTW was awesome). I have mixed feeling about this case though. On one hand, it's quite cute, the GPS fit fine, and the price was right. On the other hand, the zipper on one side broke within one week, and that was under extremely gentle use. It wasn't even during a road trip, for Pete's sake. Come to think of it, I'm not entirely sure that the zipper ever worked. Hmmm...  Anyway, the case still works, more or less. It's a double-zipper setup, so as long as I don't use the broken portion of the zipper, the case still closes most of the way. It's still cute, and protects the GPS for the most part, so it's not all bad, which is why I'd probably give this 2.5 stars, but I rounded up because it still does what it's supposed to, more or less.   At the cheapo price I paid, it wasn't really worth returning. Still, it would've been nicer if the zipper had lasted at least through one road trip. Sheesh.  I guess you get what you pay for.",3,2
"What I got works. But it's not the silicone case with the detachable band as depicted in the picture. I really wanted the silicone case so when I'm not working out, my Ipod would have a little extra protection but instead I got a strap with a built-in case. There's a flap on the inside of the strap that the iPod fits in. The entire iPod is displayed through a clear screen with a hole cut out where the wheel is. Then there is a hole cut out for headphones. 5 stars for working perfectly, but 1 star for not being what I paid for.",3,1
This product was cheap which is what I was looking for and had many reviews that I thought were helpful. Auto Zone has the exact same thing but for like 25 dollars. The adapter did what I wanted it to do. I plugged it into my ipod and my car and I could listen to the music no problem. Its simple and easy to use. I did experience some static and I have to keep my ipod in a certain spot or the static is worse. I would reccommend this.,3,1

"This device works pretty good with it connected directly to your car stereo which Best Buy will install for about $50. It also will play your Ipod and Iphone and if you subscribe to XM/Sirius that ap can conveniently play through your Iphone and is very nice, even better if you have the new Iphone 4s and it can be used like sync (voice command).  I would give this 3 out of 5 stars, it is overall loud and clear and the satellite only loose's signal in area's that are very wooded.  Depending on where you plug it in it can be at your hand's reach.",3,1
This item was easy on the purse strings for a reason. Very hard to get a clear channel for static-free listening.,3,1

"I got this case for my iPod 2g. I was really excited about it when it came because i had been looking for cases and i finally got one. When I got it and opened it up everything was fine so i took it out to put on my iPod. The case fits but it doesn't really snap into the back part of the case. Theres still a bit of space in-between where the two covers connect. The design is cool and it looks awesome but some of the paint around the volume buttons, off button, home button, and the place where you plug the cord in, is sorta scratched and looks very bad. On the back of it to the bottom left and top left there are these ugly square looking silver things ( you can sorta see them in the picture). The place where the border slants in towards the screen has the same paint issue. Other than that the design is really cool and so are the colors! I'd give this a 2 1/2 star rating if i could. Thanks!",3,1
"Several disks have stopped playing about midway through, others play completely.  Need to determine if disks need cleaning, are bad (will play on another player) or unit is faulty.  May comment later if find out which.",3,1
its ok it plays through my radio ok at times sometimes the station i took over takes over the transmitter and the charger port on it doesn't work for my iphone 5c but the usb and mu other charge cord work just as fine so far i like it could use alil more looking into as far as the useless charge cord attached to it,3,2
its a very nice case other then that the ipod doesn't fit in the case making it hard to reach the controls,3,2
Ok,3,1
"Some people considering buying this product or one like it should know that it reduces the volume and the quality of the sound, even if nothing is plugged into the other female side. The volume in my left ear was less than that in my right ear in my ATH-M50s when I tested this out just now. It may not matter as much if you use small headphones.",3,2

Easy to find in a blackout, fun to dance with @ night, and the tightness keeps dust out even during messy yard work-- The screen cover also works very well.

The case was sturdy and protected the back of my ipod from scratches but it didnt protect my screen from cracking when i dropped it. this case is better for those who dont want scratches on the backs of their ipods.,3,1
Smaller than I thought. Since it is a Christmas gift do not know if will work and if it does have the range it says.,3,2
"This case provides scratch protection for the rear of the iPod only.  It will not protect it from shock, drops or falls.  It goes on and off of the iPod a little too easily.  If you just want something to protect the back, this will work.  If you want a full iPod protection solution, look elsewhere.",3,2

You change the language to English and everything is pretty straightforward. I did not need the manual, but the Engrish is enough to understand basic functionality.<br /><br />The suction cup in normal weather and environment holds secure, but it has fallen off once on a hot day. I have plans on securing the camera with either some zip ties or good Velcro tape underneath my radar detector (which is mounted on my rear view mirror)<br /><br />Everything would point to a 4 star review, but I dropped a star because the car charger would not power the device. This might have been a show-stopper, but I also have plans on hard-wiring it with 5v USB hard-wire kits aimed at powering TomTom and other GPS units. They run on 5V 1.2 amps so I am hopeful that it will work. I have already tested it using TomTom's regular car charger and my camera did not seem to have any problems. Probably because it is charging the battery as it is used, so it is a not a direct power input.<br /><br />In positioning the unit, right below the window tint line is a great place because it is out of the way, but of course it elongates the power cord. If you are able to get the included car charger to work it might be enough to run it up your car's \\""A\\"" pillar which will pop it out at your sun visor. From there you might be able to tuck it under your car's roof upholstery.<br /><br />I will post some more once I get it installed in this manner! Thanks!<br /><br />Update: I have since installed it underneath my radar detector using a TomTom 5V mini USB hard wire kit to power it.

Since it is zip-tied to my radar detector it isn't as close to the windshield as I would like, but you can't beat the no suction cup installation and hidden wires.",3,1
Works ok but a little distracting and not very user friendly. I would't recommend it for a driver but if there is a passenger I guess its ok.,3,2

"I gave the Hello Kitty Mini &#34;walkie talkie&#34; to my niece for her 5th birthday. I thought she would be able to have fun chatting with her sister, friends and parents from different rooms in the house or even outdoors. She enjoyed speaking into it but had difficulty comprehending the logistics of releasing the button after speaking to allow the two-way communication to transpire. She soon became frustrated with trying to make it work and quickly lost interest in playing with it. Maybe she will have more success with playing with it as she ages. I will say that it was well-constructed, durable, cute, and attractive. I just do not feel it is an appropriate gift for younger children.",3,1
I was fortunate enough to buy this camera on a group buy for a very low price. the quality is sub par compared to say a $200 dollar camera. license plates are not clear and pixelization and blurriness occur at speeds over 50 mph. The built in Gps stopped working 3 days later. Emailed the company and was told there is nothing they can do about it. so they sell shotty products and don't stand by them.,3,2
Ok product. Antenna is very small so reception on the radio isn't very good. Also volume doesn't go very high.,3,2
Don't like the wires but the sound is OK.  Wish there were either no wires or the charger wire was longer.,3,2
"Ok product, quality is not great - it does not stay on the wall, and some rubber parts come off compromising the waterproof claims. Sound is nice but volume is not very strong and there are no volume control buttons. I am keeping it as exchange would be a hassle but not impressed.",3,2
The product did not want to work at first but once my husband got it to work it was great. You have to take the case off of the phone or iPod to use this. Unfortunately after about a week the transmitter got really fuzzy and would cut in and out constantly.,3,2
The shell is nice enough but it is impossible to apply the screen cover without having many pockets of air underneath it.,3,1
great case however it was way more purple than pink.in color,3,1
"Received the product several weeks ago and already experienced problems from the get-go.  These, however, were just petty problems that could be solved by communicating with the vendor.  Initial vendor experience was pretty okay.  Recently, the player went dead and I could not get it to even just turn on.  I had started corresponding with the vendor once again and, this time around, he was quite defensive and sarcastic.  Later on, he responded by indicating that he was going through personal stuff.  Of course I can empathize with that, but how was I even supposed to know that?  And as a paying customer, I just needed the product to work; that was not asking for much.  And as a customer, I do have the right to narate my problems regarding the product.  I even explained to him that I did not want to be a difficult customer and I'm merely just venting.  I just never had such numerous problems with a single product in the past.  Of course I was not expecting it to function exceptionally, nor am I seeking features like the Apple Ipod.  I just merely want it to work... that's all!  But instead of accepting my explanation (which was even close to an  apology), or even just slightly apologizing for my experiences with the player, he retaliated with a response that was totally uncalled for.  His suggestion prior to his retaliation was not even helpful anymore as the player didn't power back up at all after trying so many things, including all those that he recommended.  I would opt to return the product.  Problem is, the box was inadvertently thrown out by my cousin.  Product is okay if you have the patience and time to tinker around with it while communicating with the vendor.  And if you're willing to \\""listen\\"" to all the vendor says in case problems arise.  He complained that those who experienced problems with the product were people who \\""did not listen to him\\"".",3,1
We never could get the Bluetooth feature to work.  Otherwise it's a nice product at a nice price.,3,1
"First, I will start by saying that I have a good bit of experience with installing screen protectors, albeit I am no professional.  The cleaning cloth that is included with the kit is useless.  I believe that it actually introduced more lint than it removed from the screen.  Use a good quality automotive glass cleaning microfiber cloth for better results.  The application tool is too small to be effective, use a sturdy credit card.  The screen comes with two protective films, front and back, that have tabs.  The instructions show the tabs at opposite ends that would be useful for aiding in positioning the screen.  In actuality, they were both on the same side and made it difficult to position the protective screen.  The front film is difficult to remove and resulted in peeling up the protective screen after having worked so hard to remove all of the air bubbles from underneath it.  After the install, the clarity is great and the product works as described.  Be prepared to use both screens in the kit, as the first one will most likely be trashed in the trial and error of installation.  That is of course unless you have a hermetically sealed, surgically clean room to work in.",3,1
"I purchased this Bluetooth speaker for $10 from Amazon.  This unit is just okay.  Nothing to write home about.  Sound quality is a bit tinny and lacks low-end.  But, for $10 I guess it's okay.  I like the strap which is useful for hanging.",3,2
Its okay because there is no way of telling how much it needs to charge or how much is left once it has charged an item.,3,1
"I ordered this (it was cheap enough) on the off chance that I could adapt it to work on my 2012 VW Tiguan.  Turns out that the Tiguan, like most newer cars, works entirely digitally.  This module is really designed for an analog system (modules supplies voltage to the mirror motor to fold and unfold).  In my car the mirror control switch sends a signal to the &#34;Door Electronic Control Unit&#34; which then controls the mirror motors.  I did not even bother to install it, so I can't say how well it does or does not work.",3,2
My case came in on time and protects my iPod Touch very well but when it arrived the screen protector had a lot of scratches all over it and it made the picture quality of my iPod very poor.,3,1
"This is basically the device that I've been searching for for a couple of years now. It runs a relatively modern version of Android, and I can side-load whatever APK I want. It handles the Pocket and Kindle apps pretty well, which is all that I wanted. I was even able to get a voice call going with my company's app, Talkray (though there is no microphone in this device). The side buttons work with Pocket for page turning, but not Kindle. Pocket also has a bit of weirdness around getting into fullscreen, as you need to scroll a bit each time before it goes fullscreen. However, the weirdness with both Pocket and Kindle is tolerable, and there's even a way to force a full screen refresh (hold down the left side button for a couple seconds), which is a huge help. The fact that it has a backlit screen is a nice bonus as well.<br /><br />The reasons that this is a three star product are that the device itself is a bit flakey. The wifi keeps disconnecting, and it took me forever to get even a small subset of my Pocket list synced up. I've had the thing freeze up with only one app running, several times it froze to the point where I wasn't actually sure if I could recover it. Getting Google Play installed didn't work for me, though that wasn't a huge deal in the end. Normal usage, once the larger operations of downloading hundreds of megs of data is finished, seems ok, though the wifi will not stay connected.<br /><br />If all you want this device for is a couple of apps (that you can download from apkmirrror or similar), then I think that the flakiness is tolerable. If you need Google Play, and lots of apps, then you may be pretty frustrated with this.",3,1
"The concept of this product is great, but the amterials used to execute it fall short. This product is the definition of mass-produced, simple assembly, low price products. I guess you get what you pay for. There are some people that will be COMPLETELY HAPPY with this solution, as it does the trick. I'd say it's worth the money you'll pay, but for your iPad, think about paying a little more to get a little more. I'm not sur ehow long this thing will last, but if you mount it, and then leave it permanently installed, you should be fine for months if not years of use.",3,2
Ears easily come off. Not very sturdy.,3,1
I bought this thing to use with my outdoor speakers in my backyard. The unit is made with low end components and feels very cheap.

"I have owned this for about three months now, I guess. I really like it, but some people may not:    Pros:     * Looks cool.  * Pretty sturdy.  * Comes with several trays for different iPods.      Cons:    * Blue glow is BRIGHT. Even with the power \\""Off\\"" and no music playing, it lights up the room.  * Really bad viewing angle for the time LCD. I had to prop mine up on a book to see it on my nightstand.  * Really weird way to get it to play songs off iPod as Alarm:    1) Go to the song you want on the iPod when it's plugged in.        2) On the dock, go to the TRON item (press right on the large bar), set the time you want the song to play, then  press the Play button to turn on the alarm.      3) If you want the alarm to play for a set number of minutes, go to the TROFF item (same way as above) and setup the time you want the alarm to stop. Again, press the \\""Play\\"" button to activate the timer.    * The volume resets itself after the alarm goes off sometimes. Kind of annoying.",3,2
Doesnt pick up all the time with the remote.  I have tried moveing it around but for some reason it just work all the time.,3,2
It was made a bit cheaper than I had expected. It felt like it was made of cheap plastic. It worked and did what I needed it to do just unsure of how long it will last even with the best care taken. The CD is out dated so I had to download an updated version. The ear buds also worked fine for the short time I used them.,3,1

"When buying this reader, I didn't expect long battery life. The price one must currently pay for a color display is having LCD instead of E-ink, and consequently reduced reading time before recharging. The display is good. I like the size and feel. It can display Cyrillic characters, which means that I don't have to turn the titles of my Russian e-books into Latin transliterations. This is a real plus.    The main failing of this device is its functions. No table of contents. No ability to locate chapters of a work. I have two other e-readers, older, that do this beautifully. Why not this one? Certainly not a problem with the hardware, but with what runs it.    The 100 free e-books are no bonus. They are text files copied from the web, from Project Gutenberg. There is no formatting whatever. Sometimes the texts are poorly scanned and full of mistakes. I like to take public domain texts, format them, and export them from Adobe InDesign as e-pubs.    And here is my main problem with this device. It doesn't seem to paginate such books correctly, that is, reads the pagination differently. Consequently, it will not display the entire text of the books I have created. My Cybook Opus does! My Hanvon Wise Reader does. Why not this one? Why, it doesn't even read correctly the epub version of the King James Bible that comes with the reader! It lists 1240 pages, but the last page trails off in mid-sentence in the book of the prophet Zechariah. You cannot even access the New Testament.    I have contacted Aluratek with this question, but thus far have received no answer. (The reader does seem to work OK with commercial e-books, however.)    All in all, this potentially fine product at a good price (I found mine for $90) is rendered only average by the deficiencies of its operation.",3,2
"I purchased the New Trent Arcadia Pack IMP70D 7000mAh a week or so ago and have been testing it.  The form factor is small, and the dual USB charging ports are great.  I like the concept alot.  Some have complained that you can't tell whether the unit is on, because the blue LEDs don't stay on, and that is something I have thought about, but you can verify that it is working by simply using an app that monitors the current it is putting out, and this is important for other reasons too.    The problem I am having is that the unit is not putting out the rated amperage, and there appears to be a manufacturing defect in the labeling.  I've tested the current draw from each port using two different apps.  Both of these have confirmed the same data. The 2.1 amp USB slot is putting out around 500 mA maximum (i.e., half of an amp).  The 1 amp slot is putting out around 1800 mA maximum.  It appears that the labels are actually reversed, but neither are putting out the maximum of the other, even if they are reversed.  If it were just a label defect, I wouldn't be too concerned, but the fact that the 2.1 amp slot can only put out .5 amps max (instead of a full amp) is troubling.  If these defects exist now, why should I expect this to last?    Some reviewers have complained that this will not work with their iPad.  Presumably they are attempting to charge their iPad in the 2.1 amp slot.  I have not seen any of those negative reviewers report that they actually tested and report on the amperage coming from  either slot, and it may be that some of those would actually work on the 1 amp slot if they are having the same problem I am having.  I had contacted Idealpoint to alert them to this issue and note that I was considering returning it, and they responded quickly to ask me to send them data, but then they labeled my problem as having been \\""solved.\\""  What?

I just found that it continually picked up lint, grit, who knows what from everywhere, even immacuately clean areas and even from inside a brand new purse. It seems to just pull dust motes out of the air. If you have a cat or dog, I can guarantee that every hair they shed will end up on your cover. (One visit to son's house proved that)    That makes the texture of the silicone cover, well...gritty. And uncomfortable. It made my hands feel dirty. It also gets annoying to constantly be feeling that grit against your fingers.    I loved the way it protected my ereader, but I ended up taking it off after a couple weeks due to the constantly dirty feeling texture.",3,1
"There aren't many compact boombox stereos to choose from, as you can probably tell.  What I was looking for was something with MP3 ability.      GOOD:  Compact size  Sound quality compared to other similar units  Option to use either USB or SD memory card slot  Some have said that there is no repeat function, but there is (repeat once, repeat all, shuffle)  LED readout of what songs are playing       BAD:  like others have said, the CD player makes a clicking noise. If you are playing rock, you probably will not hear it.  For softer music, it gets annoying quick....    ...So then I ripped the CDs to MP3s onto a USB Memory stick. If your memory stick has a small LED light on it and you plan on using it at night in a dark room, be aware that the light will blink rapidly while music is playing.  Also, be aware that there is a small soft \\""pop\\"" between songs. NOT as bad as the CD player though. I use the CD memory card slot.  I just pulled one out of an old digital camera I no longer use.    Volume - for some reason, the sound from MP3s is lower compared to the radio, might have to crank it up. Remember, this small unit is something you use in a medium sized room.  One reviewer said she teaches at a pool and the volume was too low.  You're gonna need to get something bigger for a big area / backyard / etc.        Compared to the other players, I'm satisfied (not thrilled, just satisfied) with this unit. Of the ones available here on Amazon, its the best choice.",3,1

The product seems to be working for my daughter's iPod.  The product was very slow on getting to me.  I ordered the product 9/26 and did not receive it until around 10/18.  I was also told for my inconvenience I would be reimbursed a few dollars but wasn't.,3,2
LEDs do not light up to the beat. they are just solid. The reason I bought these speakers was because they were supposed to beat to the music. You can imagine how disappointed I was when I powered them up and they were just solid LEDs,3,1
"It's not a bad cover, but it looks too simple. Not sure where I can put the stylus and I wonder if there is a proper place to keep.",3,2
"As described, this works just fine - it keeps your existing iPod dry.  I bought it as a gift for my wife, who found the drag of this around her arm too distracting while swimming.  Your mileage may vary.",3,1
"I bought it to use at the parks and outlets in Orlando. Good size, small and light, easy to carry. Batteries don't last very long... Less than a day.",3,1

"I've been a ham radio operator for 23 years and have built many radio projects from scratch. I bought this kit to build with my almost-7 year-old because it was less expensive than obtaining the germanium diode and high-impedance earphones, the only parts I didn't have on hand to build a crystal set. It did work GREAT on the first try!<br />The advantage of this kit is that the big coil is already wound for you. Some kits use the little pre-wound ferrite bar coils but these lack the nostalgic visual appeal remniscent of the \\""oatmeal box\\"" coil. Winding these coils by hand can be a tedious process.<br />The disadvantage is that all the wires are connected using 4 \\""paper binder\\"" stud clips with 2 washers slipped over them. You put the wire ends between the washers and then push this clip through a hole in the chassis and spread the tips underneath to hold it place. It requires considerable manual dexterity to do this, beyond most 8 year-olds.  I would have preferred small screws with wingnuts. The instructions are less than perfectly clear.",3,1
"When it arrives, it it perfecty in shape. It is a tight fit, so once it is on.. don't plan on taking it off. Dirt gets inside it pretty easily tho. Also the zebra chips off after some usage. Eventually mine just fell apart and the sides cracked.",3,2
For it's price its ok.  I purchased this to listen to music at my desk using my phone.  Charging and listening to music seems to be problematic.  Bluetooth drops when power is very low; obviously.  But plugging USB in to PC or outlet causes static sound and no music.  Trying to use headphone jack relates to similar issues.  If it is charged it works well.  it has good sound for its size.,3,1
Never thought I would say this but the base is a little heavy and tends to dull the highs.  Also it does not have a volume control on the speaker.,3,2
"Almost too big, but then I've ordered some that are too small.  T",3,2

I will update my review when the trip is done.",3,2

"This case is pretty, very soft, and fits my Nook Color just right. It was a decent price too. There are a couple issues though.  First, when you have the front flap open to read, usually I tuck it behind the Nook, when I do this, or say, when my kids are playing a game and do this, it covers the speaker and the sound gets extremely muffled. Second, I've had this about 10 months now, and about a month ago, the magnet that holds the front cover snug when closed, has come loose and is rolling around the inside of the cover.  There's no way to fix it unless I want to take apart the stitching and re-glue it.  Third, I seriously doubt the material is real leather since there are a couple spots that are rubbing off, but they are pretty small spots.  Overall, a good deal and it works with minor issues.",3,1
"The Oontz has good sound and decent power for its size.  But, it is smaller than I expected and not what I wanted.  I ended up getting the JBL Charge - which is a great unit with great sound, good bass and volume.",3,1
"This dash mount started off great.  It's heavy, the suction plate is perfectly smooth and my GPS suction mount held very well.  No matter what I did, the thing didn't budge on the dash, which was actually a bit surprising.  After about 9 months, however, it started losing its grip on the dash.  It quickly became a sliding projectile that was a nuisance to hold onto while turning corners or accelerating.  Unless there's a product out there that restores the grip to the rubber base, I'm afraid it has lost its use.  This product was about half the price of other dash mounts so I guess I know why now...",3,1
"It does its job. The grip is not tight enough that GPS was dropped twice over 1 year. I uses my GPS everyday. However, I just use it since my old one dose not stick to window anymore. You might be able to exchange grip with original one.I did not try yet.",3,1
"It's a good radio, but is it worth all that $$$$$$$..",3,1
"not bad for the price of course.. but it is defiantly not an otter box not even close. the silicon is cheap and everything clings to it, its extremely thin every time i take it off it feels like it's going to rip. but again not bad for the price of course. also you have to put on the screen protector part yourself really did NOT like that.",3,2
"I am not a picky person and certainly know I can't ask too much for a $55 camcorder shipped to my door.<br /><br />First of all, The video quality is good though not crystal sharp but way better than acceptable. no complaint.<br />Other functions are ok it all depends on personal preference, I don't really care much about those voice, zoom, picture taking, lock ...etc.<br /><br />The 2 problems I have is first, it only allows 1, 2, and 3 minutes recording files. Not 5 minutes as other users claimed. no big deal but I prefer 5-10 minute recording files since 3 minutes each file is a little too short and I end up with 100's files on my SD card.<br /><br />second, big issue here, it doesn't LOOP RECORD. I was using a 16GB SD card and set to 3 minutes loop recording but it doesn't erase the oldest file when the card is full. The camera just stopped when the card is full which is like 1-2 days driving time for me. Then I have to format the card and record again.<br />I have tried everything, even hard reset the device but couldn't make it work. It just quit by itself and says \\""card Full\\"" on the screen. Come on, I don't want to re-format the card everyday just to make it work. This is supposed to be an installed and forget device but it is now too much a hassle if I have to format the card every time before I drive.<br /><br />The seller is quick response but doesn't help much. I am not sure if this is just one defective device I am unluckily getting. but I am returning this and see if the seller allow me to try another one.<br /><br />Will update if the return works out.",3,2
"Great unit for the size, bluetooth is great no wires needed, decent battery life.    The unit sometimes will not pickup sat lock, you have to wait a while or turn it off and back on again, but usually keeps a good lock once it gets it. Also location is important, needs to be out in the open and unobstructed to get a solid lock.    If you need something that works every time you need it and 100% of the time and very quickly, go with another device. Unit can be a pain when it's not picking up a sat lock and you are in a rush.",3,1
"The kicker sub with the box is a good combination and produces deep, clean bass but you might as well throw away the amp.

"These speakers are pretty good. It depends what you listen to though. It's not very loud, but you can definitely plug it to your Ipod and go. I watch movies and sometimes the sound isn't as loud as it's as I hope. The design is very pretty and it doesn't feel flimsy at all.",3,1
"I have bought from BargainCell before and was very pleased with what I got.  came normal speed, not very high quality (i bought usb cable and charger for my cell phone) but it was great for the price (98 cents)    I am only writing this review in reply to other reply",3,1
"Pros:    I have worked in stereo installation for about 15 years now.  The Jensen VM8023HD is one of the more versatile head units I have dealt with in terms of peripheral connectivity.  It has a connector for just about everything (2 RCA outs, 1 sub out, iPod, Satellite radio, 2 video outs, camera in).  All of these connectors, though, do make it a bit bulky for install if you are short on room around the double-din unit.    The sound is fantastic and very customizable.  It is a very clean-looking unit that will certainly spruce up any console.  It has a small DVD screen (only 4x3) but the picture clarity is great and I don't have any desire to watch DVDs in my car, so I doubt that functionality will ever be used.    Cons:    Once installed, the challenge sets in.  Almost every button on the face has a different function based on source (tuner, sat radio, etc) and WITHIN each source, most are at least dual-purpose based on how many times you hit the button or for how long.  I have had mine installed for 3 days now (I know, not a long period of time), but I am still at nearly the same loss for how to navigate it as I was when I first turned it on.      Overall:    Rating is a 3 of 5 stars due to the convoluted interface.  It performs as hoped, but getting there can be a battle!",3,1
"I got this for my fiancee and for the most part, she likes it. Let's face it. For thirty bucks, you really can't complain much. I've used it as well. It's hard to find radios with tape players now, and you really can't complain about quality of sound with this thing. The tape player works, the CD player and radio works. But it doesn't have a mic jack, or a built in microphone, so if you're looking for a tape player/recorder that you can record voice with, don't get it. If all you want to do is record from the radio or CD, it does that just fine, however. In fact, I think that was the only complaint.",3,1
"The pouch itself seems to be made from a nice cushiony black material and I think that it should hold up well. The accuracy has been slightly variable but not enough for me to complain too greatly about it.     The problem is that after approximately 6 runs with this in two shoelaces, the red strip of material on the back became loose and the whole thing fell off. Luckily I was on the treadmill to recalibrate my sensor and it only flew back a couple feet. The stitching that keeps that strip attached is very weak. When I looked at it again it seemed to be attached about about 4 loops of stitches and it wasn't very sturdy.     Fortunately I've just looped the flap under my shoelaces and velcro-ed the flap over the shoelace to keep the pouch in place. The velcro has held on thus far for an additional 20 runs and I seriously hope it holds on for a while longer or else I will be extremely disappointed by the product.",3,2
"This worked for a few times. Then it only worked if I turned my phone off. Seems to work ok for my husbands iphone, so it just might be my phone that needs to be fixed. But this was a good buy...just wish it worked better for my phone.",3,2

"I bought a product similar to this by Griffin that was on sale. It broke, so I bought this one (the other had gone up in price). It connects to the ipod or mp3 fine and plays through the radio, but I often have static. I've tried many stations and they just don't come through clear. There's a little whine behind them.",3,2

Item did not fit the ipod it was purchased for.  Was supposed to be for this exact model but was not.,3,2
"I bought this because I thought it was insanity to spend $40-50 or more for a product that only cost me $149. I wanted something that zipped all the way around and that would be at least water resistant.     This product has fit the bill okay. I have the nook wifi version and I find that the black strap seems to be a bit too high. It covers the last line of the text on my nook screen, so I usually pop the nook up about a 1/2 inch to fully read it. But it works out decent since that's a better angle to read at, anyway. This has been on the table twice when a drink was spilled, and it was also rained on once - getting fairly saturated both times. Thankfully, the liquid did not penetrate through the case, and surprisingly the outside of the case doesn't look any worse for the wear.    The nook also seemed a bit too small for the case itself, it slipped around in there a bit. So I bought [...]\\""Premium Clear Soft Gel Silicone Skin for the Nook\\"" and this really helped a lot. Not only does the nook no longer slide around in the case, but it's just another layer of protection.     Overall, the case is absolutely worth the $15 I paid for it. It's not perfect.    My ebook light was dead on arrival and I never bothered to follow up with the seller for a replacement, so I am not even including that in my review.",3,2
"It says Cushion Quilted ~ well, it's hard plastic. Nothing cushioned or quilted about it. Acts like it's going to be kind of soft, or furry... it's a hard plastic with creases in it. The gold casing was not easy to put on or take off. It cracked a bit even in putting it on. But, I guess for the price....it's okay.",3,2
The charger takes like forever to charge. It does not look like nothing on the pictures it looks like other kind of ipod cable. I was expecting the one from te picture but I got a whole dfferent order,3,2
"I haven't used this speaker too much so far (at most 8-10 separate occasions), but I've been pleased with it—it has decent sound, great battery life so far, and it is a really convenient way to enjoy music, a podcast, or an audiobook wherever I might be. The one thing that really concerns me, however, is something I noticed yesterday: The on/off slider on the back of the speaker is starting to recede, which means it's very hard to reach it to slide it on or off. It's disappointing to see that happening after the modest use it's had, and I guess I have to decide pretty quickly whether I'm going to return it or not (before my return window closes). I'll use it for the next day or two to decide. If it gets to the point where I can't turn it on or off anymore, I guess that'll be the deal-breaker. I've enjoyed the convenience, but I'm not going to keep it if that switch becomes non-functional.  Updated on 6/10/2015:  I reluctantly decided to return this speaker because I was no longer able to slide the on/off switch at all—I would have had to get a paperclip or something like that. It's a shame, because it was a handy little speaker to have around, and I'll miss it. But there's no point in having a $32 paperweight gathering dust, so I decided to return it to Amazon while I still could.",3,2
"I bought this product for a gift to my 10years old child. As it was his 1st personnal product of this type, he loves it. But... I can say, there are a few things I don´t like:  * The buttons are so hard, that after playing a while, you would like to change... your fingers.  * The sound quality is too poor. The external speaker is terrible, and the headphones provided, are terrible. A lot of noise even the 1st time I used them.  * When I plug the device to the computer, Windows recognize 2 different drives for it. Smells fishy. I read that this could happen when you have a smaller unit formated as 1 GB... Not sure, but be carefull.  * If you have another device as drive E or drive F, you will need to disconect them, because the software included in the device, recognices only this letters as available for this product.",3,2
"If you want a cover to reduce glare, then buy this product. It goes on easy and is S pen compatible. However, since it is a Matte to reduce glare, I think it also slightly reduces the clarity of the display.

"Pack:   Upon first viewing this product at home i realized this is very small. The picture made it look like it was big enough to actually hold the tripod comfortably. In fact the tripod is almost twice the height. Once i opened every pouch and everything i realized this has a lot of space for something so small. I have to admit it isn't very comfortable to have on your back but if you use one strap it looks and feels fine. A lot of padding which is great. I have to admit it is very tight with my Pentax K10D but its really not that big a deal, and i just feel that much more secure. One negative note about it, was the Velcro that is all over the inside, was poorly sewed onto it. A few of them were only half on (the dividers can be moved around using Velcro).   Tripod:  The tripod was only a 10 dollar add-on so i thought.. oh well its going to be something cheap.. to leave in my trunk just-in-case. In fact it is a great little tripod. It feels like its got a sturdy construction. It has 2 level's on it. And it feels the opposite of cheap. FYI it does come with a little case for the tripod, now that is cheap, but it came with it so i'm not complaining.   Cleaning kit:  Eh, i probably won't even use it. Not a big deal, nothing special to me, but i suppose someday it will come in handy.     I WOULD RECOMMEND. Its not too expensive, and shipping to CT took from sunday to now Thursday. Not that big a deal seeing they couldn't have possibly sent it out sunday ;-).",3,2
"I was really happy with this case for the first couple months.  It fits my iPod Touch 3rd generation really well.  Love the color (red looks better in real life than the picture--deeper red) and love the little stand option.  The little arm that folds out for the stand is what I presumed would break pretty fast, but it's been fine.  It's the thin piece of rubber(?) that runs along the bottom of the case between the screen and the headphone jack that broke.  I'm not sure how it broke, but I had to put a subtle but still ugly blob of superglue on it to fix it.  Then it broke AGAIN, so I took another shot with the super glue and it's been okay for the past few weeks.  So be gentle, ironically, with your protective iPod case.  In all other ways, it works great.",3,1
It worths the money paid,3,2
"Nice metal, I think. Works to attach 8 gauge power to screw terminals. I have had no issues using these connectors.",3,1

The plastic is thin & the part that opens to insert the USB cable seems to be fragile.   So overall, it's alright but only for short-term or non-heavy-duty use.",3,1
"I bought my forerunner slightly used about 4 months ago.  For someone who is just getting started with a good fitness routine this product should prove to be beneficial. Depending on where I am it can easily interface with my desktop PC or my MAC laptop...definitely a plus.

Other than that I am quite pleased with it.",3,1

"1:  The kickstand housing bulges out the back so that the iPod no longer lays flat on its back; it seesaws.  If, like me, you like laying your iPod flat on a table and typing, forget it!  2:  When the kickstand is out and the iPod is propped up on its side, the kickstand housing bulges out the edge so, again, you get the seesawing effect.  3:  The kickstand rattles a bit when in the closed position.  The case looks nice, but (for me) it's just not usable.",3,2
"The retractable charging cord is OK, but fits loosely into my Kindle and other devices.  It seems the fitting is just a very little bit too small and has a tendancy to fall out of the device being charged if you move it even a little bit.

The other pieces are OK, but you can tell they are knock-offs in that they don't fit as an original would.<br /><br />However, on the high note, my cat, Cootie,  just loves the green wrist band.  He can bat that around on the floor and play with it for hours. He wanted me to thank the seller for including that.",3,1

The problem is 1.  the remote does not always work and there is about a 5 sec delay when you press a button and when you are driving that is not a good thing.  At first I thought it was the remote so I contacted the company and they relplaced it at no charge within 3 business days, (like I said GREAT customer service).  However I have had the product about a month now and it is completly falling apart I now have to put tape in the product to hold it in place.  I raley even take it out of the care so I am not sure how that happen.  also the soft foam in the holder just fell off and my I pod was falling out I had to glue the foam back in.  I like the product but it is poorly made.  I am not sure if I would buy this product again, even at the price, I should have gotten more than 1 month out of it before it fell apart.  Again sound quality is great and rarley do I get any static.",3,2
"Well, the placement for the screws is correct, but there is a lot of trouble.  First, when I opened the dash of my dart with the stock uconnect 200 stereo, it was clear that there was no room for a double din radio to fit.  So I had to cut out the plastic and metal housing for the stock single din radio, and I also had to trim away a bit of my dash bezel as well for my radio to fit through it after I gutted the inside. second, the plastic brackets for the side are much too thick to use the screws that come with the radio.  So I had to drill those out a bit as well.  Even though my new stereo looks good in the dash of my car now, this kit requires trimming, and if you have the same sound system as I do, you will have to trim your dash as well.",3,1

I was going out of the country to an area in Mexico where electric was not always going to be available so I needed some sort of backup. I finally settled on this product after a lot of research. I noticed that only one reviewer had had any questionable results while using the 9900. Well I guess I am the second. After charging two Iphones overnight the charger was on its last bar after a full charge that morning. The product worked fine but I was lucky electric was nearby to recharge during the day. The unit appears well built but it just doesn't perform as I had hoped.,3,2

"Pros:  + Good fit (seems just thick enough)  + Not a bad price, relatively (but I still think all these accessories are rip-offs)  + Easy installation w/ no bubbles    Cons:  - It absolutely loves my fingerprints (definitely more than not having it on...and I had it with no protection for a couple of weeks now)  - Has too much friction when trying to glide my fingers    Conclusion: Not bad, but gonna look for a better one. I just hate the friction...so much.",3,1
I wanted a mic clip to hold a handheld VHF radio.  Top and bottom fastening was desirable.  This clip fit the requirement and it has served me well.  The down side is that it came from SE Asia.  The clip cost a dollar and the postage was six dollars.,3,1
The screen print of the words is not as high quality as advertised but it still is a cute case,3,2
Nice little cheap charger. Next time I'd go with a float charger tho this one needs to tell you when its charged at least.,3,1
The first one that came had problems.  It would just shut down in the middle of operations for no apparent reason.  I would use the reset button (operated by poking a paperclip in a hole) and it would work for a while then shut down again.  I contacted the seller.  I have got to say they were very easy to deal with.  They simply asked me to send it back and they would send a replacement.  They even reimbursed me the 12 bucks shipping cost to ship it back to them.  The replacement came and to date I have had no problems with it.  There is a minor flaw in it though.  The screen gets blanched out in sunlight and is hard to see.  It's also very reflective so light behind you affects the screen visibility.  It does work well and has plenty of user defined options that are nice.  Good for the price I suppose.,3,1
"This is a very good speker and works well I was very surprised., but I just E mailed the seller because this is a rechargeable<br />battery speakr. Who would have thought the would not include charge cable for it, run time is 4 to 8 hours, what do I<br />do after that, otherwise great sound but for  the cost not to include cabe to recharge.",3,1
"this was another replacement toy from nylabone. it's hard like the chew fish toy, but not as hard as the teething ring one. popeye loves the corners and can manuever it well with his paws, but after 4 hours, i noticed deep cuts, puncture marks and shreds in this one too. it's heavy and kind of thuds around loudly when he plays with it, but if it keeps him busy, i love it too!",3,1
"I like the case. I like the belt clip. I haven't used the armband.    My problem is with the screen protector. As you may have read, many people have fought with them. I didn't really have problems applying it, only a few air bubbles. The problem is the quality of the plastic on the screen protector. The plastic was dirty and scratched when I got it! It didn't clean off, I think some of the dirt is on the sticky part. I cleaned the screen and I never touched the screen protector. It's just really poor quality.     I don't know if it's just mine, or they are all like this... I just feel that if I am going to buy a nice mp3 player with a nice screen, I should get at least a decent screen protector so it doesn't hurt the quality.     Also, don't think the cloth is a great deal. It's a little thin piece of cloth half the size of a toilet paper square.",3,1
"Within the first time using this product, one of the velcro circles came unglued from the armband. It is also an extremely tight squeeze to try to fit the ipod into the sleeve, and it is impossible to fit in with the plastic case. I would have preferred the sleeve for the ipod to be a bit more flexible so I can leave it in its protective case and still fit it in the sleeve to go running. Despite its imperfections, it still serves its function, but I doubt it will last a very long time.",3,1
"I just received my unit yesterday and set it up today.  My intention was to purchase an upscale clock-radio/alarm clock to be placed on my (rather small) bedroom dresser.  Well this item is quite a bit larger than I expected (I should have paid more attention to the published dimensions).  Also the styling of this item is remarkably drab and hardly contemporary, being more reminiscent of the 1970s.  If these concerns are unimportant to you, everything else about this audio system appears to be satisfactory.",3,1
Its a good device for its price. The only big problem is you have to constantly buy 3A batterys. I go through 1 or 2 batterys each day,3,1
"Its good, but does not close like I<br />would like it to.",3,1
"I bought it as a replacement for a lost remote. Everything on the remote works fine except it came with a dead batter and there is no MUTE button, other than that I'm happy with it.",3,1
The good news is I did not have to pay to buy an entirely new Bose Wave system.  The bad news is now I have to use two remote controls to control the iPod and the volume.,3,2
The instructions indicate that battery backup only works for a few days. I tested and only lasted 5 days. Must be hard wired. Didn't work for me.,3,1
ION controller neat tool for a quick gigs or house party's. I wish the jog wheels where move another inch or two can easily touch when fading from one song to another.,3,1
"Case is nice, fits my 80GB Classic, however, the back of the silicon case does say 30GB.  The only thing I DON'T like about it is that the touch wheel on my iPod does not work with the case on.  For a quick fix, I cut the middle circle out (where the click wheel is), works fine for now.  For the price, can't beat it.  Still looking for a case that's a little more durable though.",3,1
"Has pretty good Video in day light.  Night time very  poor, Sound has has lot of static on play back  Wish there were choice in color instead of black,  bad in  Ariz sun sticking on windshield,  unit tends to heat up from the sun,  every time I  park I remove unit and put in a case I brought,  always  hot.  Planning on making a shade or buying Alum AC duct tape and cut small strips and glue them to the top of the unit and mounting bracket . Never leave unit in your car when parked even in your own drive way. Control buttons functions on the unit,  paint wearing off,  buttons paint should have been printed be on case not on buttons function  very poor paint.  I should have cover them with scotch tape and carefull cut away exess tape around function buttons with a exaco knife.other wise work for what I want",3,2
The prongs part of this item broke the first week I had this item. Thankfully I had an apple one lying around so everything works great now and I really love the 2 USB ports.,3,1
"I ordered this for my nook color, but there was<br /> a nook simple touch case in the box, Oh no.",3,1
"The paint comes off.  That is all I have to say.  The blue comes off, and you'll see silver from the bottom.  Pretty much last a few weeks before things starting to fall apart.",3,1
"I bought this item. They were easy to install but a little disappointing. There is nothing special about these headrests.  They are cheap for a reason. They have the option of changing from video 1 or 2 but only have one video input. They have volume controls on them and the remote but only have audio in with no speakers attached to the headrest.  So unless you're just replacing some bad monitors in your vehicle or already have the rest of the equipment, buy something else. You will need a DVD player that's capable of powering speakers and speakers to set up a system in your vehicle. At the cost of buying all the equipment you could get a set that have the DVD player with speakers for cheaper.",3,2
"The bright pink color is true to life and it fits snugly, but the picture really doesn't show how thin and flimsy the cover is. The silicon case I had several years ago was thicker, with extra padding on the delicate corners, but this one has none of that. I definitely would be worried if I ever dropped it with just this case on it (which I do often!)    There is an opening in the bottom for the plug in, which fits perfectly, but the top has no coverage at all! I'm worried it will bounce around as I'm running. Overall, not worth purchasing.    The armband is nice though, fully adjustable as the entire strip is made of velcro.",3,1
"I  like the antiglare screen protector but it doesn't work well. it's really hard to place it on the iPod, and after I placed  the case on ipod the screen protector started peeling off and the glue in the corner dissapered!",3,2
good product but the instructions suck. needs to have clear instructions on how to use this product. spent way to much time using youtube to see how to do it.,3,1
"When i first got this item,i thought it would be a waste of time to even try it. Maybe it because of the color (light blue). I was wrong.It plays the song from each folder and it also remembers the last song when i switch of the ignition. The screen is a bit on the tiny side,don't try to see the title when driving,it also have a glare that make it harder to see.Remote works,but I have to play with the buttons before it actually do something.Compare to the CD and radio audio the sound is a little lite, and the equalizer doesn't help much.Other form that it a good little player, and it does what it says and for the price. thinking of getting another one for my sister.",3,2
"Folds up nicely for packing in a carry-on.  Plays any device with an iPod-style earphone jack.  Sounds good on the desk (it actually sounds better than the price might indicate).  Does not charge any iPod, so the device drains power while playing.  Great for travel and temporary use, poor for bedroom or work.    Note:  the photo does not show you that the power and audio cables stick out the top of the unit, making it appear very messy while in use.  Even while operating on batteries, the audio cable still sticks out the top, because that's where the port is on the iPod.",3,2
"Nice for the price, but unfortunately the belt clip falls apart only after 3-4 months of use. For the price, buy extra if you need the belt clip so you have a replacement on hand.",3,2
"I'm use lab supplies that I set the voltage I want and the max current to be delivered.  After reading the book, first page; &#34;This serial single switch power supply is a kiind of a DC regulated power supply&#34;, These is an inexpensive pwr supply that is not adequate if you need 0.000mA or 0.000DCV accuracy, the decimal point does not &#34;float!&#34;  Example; .385mA cannot be determined, it displays .4mA.  Lots of &#34;RULES&#34; to follow when using this pwr supply; page one of the manual warnings state, DO NOT CONNECT ANY LOAD TO PS BEFORE IT'S TURNED ON!  LIKEWISE, MAKE SURE TO DISCONNECT THE LOAD BEFORE SHUTTING DOWN THE PS.  DAMAGES TO THE PS CAN HAPPEN IF YOU DO NOT FOLLOW THIS. There are more.  I would recommend this to others unless they had adequate electron training or schooling.  Also, use quality bannana clips, the ones supplied are cheap and do not fit tight.",3,2
"I use one of these on my small, trailerable sailboat and it's really great at indicating wind direction. The size and shape make it very easy to read thirty feet in the air, and it's very sensitive.  My complaint is with the cheap plastic mount (the J-bracket). Since I trailer my boat to winter storage, I remove the Windex annually.  The plastic mount breaks every other year. It cracks easily when you tighten the set-screw so that the wind vane mast does not rotate.  Replacement brackets are available, but not cheap ($11).",3,1
"It's really pretty, I got a lot of compliments. The only con is that it's not durable plastic so the front part broke after one week of usage. I still have the back part on because I love the design.",3,1
"This is for Ipod nano 5g with camera, the difference is the earphones output.. because Its in the other side, but for otherwise is really comfortable and looks and has been of high quality",3,1
"GPS tracking collars have become an indispensible part of hunting with hounds. However, because my Garmin DC 30 collars persistently loose contact with the receiver I run my hounds with a both a Garmin DC 30 and a conventional tracking collar. Perhaps the best function of a GPS tracking system is the hunter can see exactly what an indevidual hound is doing, which hound gets hung up on a scent, which takes the direct line.",3,1
Kids seem to enjoy these.Don't believe the outrageous distance claims and you will be happy for the price,3,1
this is a good case but after use the movie stand wont click back into place because the plastic peice it locks into chipped so it stays out all the time but overall the case is good,3,1
"This ipod case is very cute. I've gotten compliments on it. But the downside is that this case is not very durable. The case itself comes off very easily, which is not good if you are looking for a case to protect your actual ipod. I also don't really like the material that is made out of. Although the interior of the case is hard, the exterior is made of this foamy material which can be easily scratched and may tear. But on the bright side, I'm glad I found a case for the 3rd generation ipod, because you can never find those in stores anymore.",3,1
"Well, you can't leave it on when trailering and it will not act as a sun screen.  (At least I can'f get t to shade the screen).  Other than that it looks cool siting on the unit.  I do not recommen this at all.",3,2
"I bought this item.  I found that it is OK, but does not work the way I thought it would.  I needed to put the vice part around the skinnier part of my GPS and not the wide part.  Maybe I'm doing it incorrectly, but that's the only way I could make it work.  This item said it was good for the 330 model, so not sure what I'm doing wrong.  I wanted an item that would work by not attaching it to my windshield.  This does serve the purpose, just not as easily as I thought.",3,2
"I have found that buying this type of product, I would rather do my shopping at walmart.com or monoprice, I have ordered some generic items and a few right from china that are junk.  The price was right, but the product was junk. So read the reviews. This particular product seemed to work ok.",3,2
"I really like this, but the display is an issue. Here's why you'll see reviewers that complain about the display being too dim (unreadable in the bright light of day), like me, and others who either don't comment on that or don't find it a big problem.<br /><br />It's about the vertical viewing angle. If the mounting is sloped, so that the top of the faceplate tips away from your line of vision, (you're looking at it from a lower angle), you can't see the display in bright light. Period. And anti-glare measures won't help. If your view the display from a higher angle more or less perpendicular or a higher angle, it's easier to see (although still ridiculously dim for a modern device). So, take this into consideration if you're thinking of buying it.<br /><br />I'm going to be replacing it. Can't see the damn thing.",3,1
The volume is too low,3,2
Doesn't work on 2005 Acura TL. Tested product on a friends Toyota Yaris and it worked perfectly. I'm giving three stars because the product clearly states it doesn't work on all cars. Just disappointed I wasted $50 and now will gift it to a family member.,3,2
made very well only the clasp to keep it closed does not work made out of leather fits nook good,3,1
"very beautiful, I loved",3,1
When it comes to sound quality and battery life I have no complaints. But the lack of an ear-hook made hard to keep it on. I lost it after a few weeks.,3,2
I use this speaker with my tablet most of the time while doing yard work . I also use while riding my mountain bike . I stream Pandora through it on both devices . The only problems so far is it doesn't work to good on the Bluetooth to phone while talking. Also it would only play music for about an hour an a half . The battery would not hold a charge . I has to pull the battery out of another device that I use to listen to my music from my sd card from my phone. I use that device for when there is no cell or internet service . I had ordered 2 extra batteries for it . I use those in this Bluetooth speaker to replace the one that came with it and those will make the bluetooth speaker play for 4 to 5 hours . The kick stand on the battery cover broke off 2 weeks after getting it . Overall it sound good and I can hear it with no problem in trafic . I think it will be loud enough for me to here it on the handlebars of my motorcycle .,3,1
"ok, for the price, not as bright as stated. 4 out of 10 defective.",3,2
"Are perfect Visors I bought them for the regular BT50, But when i received i noticed the where for the Mazda BT50 PRO",3,1
"The speakers are good, but the highs are too 'sharp' to my liking. Very fatiguing on long runs or higher volumes. May be good for the Ghetto Gangs with a loud sub",3,1
"The application kit was not that useful, you are better off using a credit card to take out the bubbles off the screen. Once the screen protector is on, you can see glare when you are looking at the screen (indoors).",3,2
Fabric is nice. More weight and beans needed to give it a solid base. Over all it is good for traveling.,3,1
"This little speaker is amazing, plain and simple! I have purchased a few portable speakers over the years and none have compared to this. Once I received the speaker (which did take a little longer than expected, but still by standard eight days if you subtract weekends), I was expecting very good sound quality due to all the spectacular reviews, but did expect it to be this fantastic. I think we've all learned to not expect too much from a portable speaker, but AYL has definitely created an exception to the rule! As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a replacement for  your current sound systems, but it is definitely an affordable and exceptional replacement for the crappy speakers that are on so many of our laptops, mobile devices, and (or lack there of) mp3 players. As portable speakers go, you'd be hard pressed to find better.  Update: Maybe I spoke a little too soon...suddenly, massive interference. Worked great for about a week, now the buzzing and cracking is a little too much to ignore. :(",3,1
"To the person who said the company tried to convince her they are supposed to have very little water and to turn volume up high for the water to dance, well they were telling the truth. I don't have this brand but the ones I do have and all of the ones I've seen are like that. I first thought the water wasn't even in mine but it was. Most of these type speakers are not high quality they are for the show. It's more if a novelty gift in my opinion but they are neat!",3,1
"The product is a good quality cover for the Sony 950 and the charger and screen protector make it good deal.  The bad part is that the cover is not specifically designed for the 950 or the designer wasn't very bright.  The Top elastic strap covers half of the on/off switch.  The top leather corner covers half of the memory card. The bottom elastic strap covers half of the WiFi switch.  The bottom leather corner covers half of the volume switch.  Now, most of the difficulties with this product are visible in the pictures and if I had looked a little closer I would have seen them.  So my dissatisfaction is of my own making.",3,1
The motor spins and is not stationary. That seriously defeats the purpose of why I bought it.<br /><br />Overall quality isn't bad. It feels solid. Sides brackets held on by tabs. Easy to pull apart if you need to. That's the only reason it got three stars.,3,1
"I really do like this product, but I have to say the two things they did wrong are so simple that the gave away perfection.  One, the band is not wide enough.  Symmetry is everything and the proportion of band to watch face seem off.  It could be me, but heck I bought it, so my opinion counts.  The second thing, and again it is my preference, though I did ask for a second opinion, it is too light.  The band should be heavier.  I would pay more just for a heavier, more robust feeling band.  As it is it looks the part, but is too light.  the band being too light makes it seem like a nano on a wristband, not a watch that is a nano.  More importantly, the lack of perfect unity, detracts from the fact that the marriage of a wristwatch with the technical capabilities of a nano-like device could, or should be represent a real evolution of the watch.  As a guy, I don't wear jewelry, so a watch is more than a time piece.  All the technical capabilities of nano on my wrist is too cool.  I just would love a heavier band.  Again, I like heavier dive watches and such.    Spater...",3,1
"bought for my itouch 32gb, 2nd generation. It fits perfectly and looks amazing. Only con is the screen protector didn't work out like I had hoped but honestly don't really need it with this case.",3,1
"It works well, and I will continue to use it.  I have used it with a laptop, mp3 player, and a tablet. The main problem is the volume loss.  Music with quieter parts will not be loud enough to overcome road noise in my work truck.  Expect there to be a noticeable difference in volume output.  Also, it emits a high pitch hum over the speakers from time to time but its not overpowering and it is usually not an issue.",3,1
I broke my screen on my i9 so I picked up a case to cover my replacement.  This case fits tight on the sides with plastic clips however it does not fite top to bottom. There is about a quarter inch gap at the top. I guess you could use this for your wraped up headset.  But it would be best to pass on this item,3,2
"The screen protector and the case are fine because that's the main reason I purchased this package.  The rests are okay, but don't look like they will last if I use them regularly.  Fortunate, they are my back up charger only.",3,1
Recently purchased the battery for HTC Prophet model. Am pretty satisfied with the battery life so far. It needs to be charged every 2 days. Decent i would say !!,3,1
"I got them as a gift and it is a good thing they come with multiples. They are not easy to apply and tend to get messed up easily. Once they are on the screen they are nice, but getting them on can be more work than it might be worth...",3,1
"Very durable- but and absolute B!+(# to put on without getting prints all over the underside. I got 2- and know that they will hold up longer than the old skins I used to buy- but when they both retire, I won't buy them again.<br /><br />The pictures make it look like the material is somewhat think- almost like a rigid piece of material that does not bend the way thin plastic would- I was hoping for this and honestly think a product like this (thicker) would do a better job.",3,1
works better than the DLO TUNE stick I bought.  Ability to use it with out connecting the car charge as well as set my own station.,3,1
"we got what we paid for. bought 6 for around the house. they have all broken over time, but they did last a year each probably",3,1
They aren't as loud as I thought they would be. I still love them. Just wish they were still a little bit louder,3,1
"I've been a user of Kenwood head units for nearly 20 years, this may be the last one I buy unless Kenwood improves their interfaces. What frustrates me the most is the volume/EQ control. Just like the Kenwood unit I had before this, the volume knob is too \\""short\\"" or \\""shallow\\"". I dont have unusually large hands or fingers and I find it very difficult to grip this knob in order to rotate it. I think my next head unit will have a toggle type volume control...that seems to make more sense. What makes it so frustrating with the KDC-MP235 is if you push on the knob it opens the audio settings menu...and it takes very little pressure to push. So, 1 out of every 4 times I go to adjust the volume I accidentally open the EQ menu. Then I have to push the knob another 6 or 7 times to get back to where I can adjust the volume. I cuss every time that happens. My 10 year old daughter, who's perfectly capable of rotating a volume knob, always knocks my EQ off the proper setting because of the sensitivity of the knob.  Kenwood really needs to re-think this interface. I also think the radio preset button are a little too small considering the frequency in which they're used. Ultimately the head unit sounds great and the tuner tunes in distant stations fantastically.",3,1
"Remember Pioneer from the days of the Supertuner in the 80's?  Well, this is not that kind of product.<br /><br />The bass button produces bass that is way too deep.  The sound with it off is &#34;OK&#34;.  The reception is a little below par.  The antenna is hard-wired into the unit, so you cannot add an external antenna.<br /><br />The good thing is that it is mutli-functional at a decent price.  You can play music from a CD, an Ipod using the built-in dock, or from a flash drive using the built-in USB port.<br /><br />This unit is not for the serious audiophile.  However, if you are looking for a kid's radio or one for the guest room that can do everything but will hardly ever be used (like me), this is a good unit.",3,1
"the case in and of itself is ok, it is just a plain case after all, but the connections at the bottom are a little close and when i plug in the car adapter it pops the case open because they don't play well together.  this is a common problem with almost all cases and i don't know what the answer is other than to be aware of the issue before you buy.",3,1
"It seems like a great concept but doesn't stay attached to the vent very well. If there are road bumps, it falls off. I ended up wedging it on the windshield where the mount apparatus keeps it secure enough. I can't really recommend this product.",3,2
"The color is cute, but didn't protect my nook at all. It actually ended up breaking during an international trip and only half of the screen could be seen. So, if you're looking for a case to make your nook look cute: it's a good buy. If not, don't bother.",3,2
"just gonna list out things that i didn't like about this alpine...    1) does not have additional slot for USB connection. so the only input methods are Ipod connection and Bluetooth from hand phone.( i bought it with the assumption that it had one.... not the seller's fault)    2)Multiple Bluetooth connection? yes .. but using them at the same time? NO! ... so what's the point for multiple connection?    3)to many wires!.. gawd!! the wires!!! good luck in hiding them.    4)Had to redo the power socket so that the unit doesn't on/off on/off itself when the car kick starts.    5) The controller seems flimsy to me and didn't like the slow response time.    other then that, it's all good.",3,2
"Got this to travel with my Nook HD +; while the Nook is only a mediocre tablet, this case with keyboard works well. Took 10 min to figure out the pairing via Bluetooth, but since then, it's worked well though I use it rarely.  NOTE: the color combo (brown and black 'leather') is not really attractive to me, but the price and its function won out for me.",3,1
I like but not. What I thought.,3,2
...but the product never arrived and they refunded in a prompt manner.  Appreciate it!,3,1
It took about 2 hours to get some progress and even then it still didn't program. You have to have patience,3,2
The plunger is so small and cute but so... CHEAP. It ripped in like 20 minutes when I took it of.. Don't buy,3,2
The Super tooth buddy is nice . we find it will not anwer the call every time.<br />When it works its great.,3,1
"I blew my subs after my amp shorted so I decided to just test a few products out.  Why sundown does make great comp subs I was fairly disappointed with these.  They have a lot of deflection in the cone but not a whole lot of sound.  For the price its just eh, there are better subs out there for the same price.<br />Before anyone says anything. Ive been installing sound systems for a few years now and had this thing hooked up to a 1800 watt kenwood amp.<br />If you are on a budget I would suggest looking at kicker comps, fosgate p2, or hifonics brutus. All of which will run you about 100 or less and have gotten nothing but positive feedback from people Ive installed them for",3,1
Simply doesn't work as advertised. It was cheap and probably I should know better. Pay more and get something that works!,3,2
I gave this as a gift to my father in law who listens to music on his iphone. It is easy enough to set up and when playing music sounds pretty good. When the phone is sitting in the cradle it leans forward a little and it doesn't take much for it to fall sideways and out of the cradle. If the iphone was able to stay in better I would give this easily 4 or 5 stars. It is frustrating you try and change the song or do something while trying to keep it in the cradle and it falls out.,3,1
"Is this speaker great for the shower? Absolutely. It has great sound, is waterproof, and sticks to tile. But guess what? it also sticks to the refrigerator, windows, doors, and mirrors!!! I love this speaker so much I bought another to stick on my fridge, and am going to buy a 3rd to keep on the living room window. It's reasonably priced, wireless, and provides excellent sound.  UPDATE 6/3/15 Well, this speaker was great while it lasted. It will no longer turn on, even when fully charged. When the power button is pressed, the blue light will turn on, but it turns off as soon as you let the button go. Bummer.",3,1
"I'm not impressed.  I thought twice before buying it to begin with because it seems to be very pricy for 2 small pieces of plastic - I mean really!  I've had one of the protector sheets on for about 2 weeks now and already the corners have lost their adhesion.  Which is really bad since I take my fire from the shelf to my recliner and back.  It doesn't get shuffled around in a purse or abused in any other way.  I bought it for extra protection for the screen, but this is a pretty crappy product.",3,2
"Having already owned a 30GB Zune for several years, I did not hesitate to buy this Zune model for my wife, sight unseen.    Pros: quality build, user interface, good sound   Cons: most display fonts too small to read without dragging out the eye-glasses  We had to return it.  Got a Sansa Fuze (NOT Fuze+) which is easy to read without glasses.",3,1
Works good for listening to music from a device. Speaker phone is so so.,3,1
"Alright, so I wasn't expecting much. That's okay because I'm putting this in my old Chevy pickup and if it gets stolen some day I didn't want to be out a bunch of money. The camera works. Now, here's my only complaint so far - this is quite possibly the most unbelievably bad manual I have ever seen in my life. It's so bad it's actually funny. The camera has three modes: video (called &#34;shooting&#34;), photos, and File management (playback). Got it, not a big deal. Now for the recording video there are a couple options that would be nice to control - like auto shake and auto night mode. Here's what the manual says, &#34;The camera start to record automatic when it is open up, press OK key to stop recording which pressed again to restart recording, press up and down key in recording model to save electricity Press up and down key in recording model for mode switch in day and night, night scene is open fill-in light.&#34; Yeah. That's typed verbatim. So, the up and down key &#34;save electricity&#34; and &#34;mode switch in day and night&#34; in &#34;recording model&#34;. Despite trying about a dozen things, all I can get the up and down keys to do are zoom in and out the camera. That was starting to get kind of frustrating because the fill lights were staying on and there was no way to turn them off or convince the camera to go out of night mode. Finally I resorted to a system reset which quite helpfully switched all the menus to Chinese and (amazingly) turned off the the night mode and associated fill light. Yay. There is also a G sensor (maybe that's the anti-shake?) that ambiguously offers me 2G, 4G, 8G, and OFF. I tried 2G and OFF in the hopes that it would reduce the number of times I thought, &#34;Gee, I have no idea how this option is supposed to work&#34; but alas, my &#34;Gee&#34; count continued to rise. Motion detection? Okay.....well, that's nice, but since it's in a car won't there almost always be motion? I was happy though to find out that &#34;You can press reset and starting up the product when a crash happened because disoperation, it will get right.&#34; Thank goodness! I hate it when I crash my car and it disoperates, but with a push of a button it will get right!",3,2
Works but gives Apple error,3,1
No instructions came with the system and the hardware did not fit through the speaker brackets.<br />Sound is just ok.,3,2
"I previously owned an Alpine amp so this was a breeze to connect in place of it. I rated it at 3 stars because I thought it would have more power than it did. Overall, it is a great amp. Maybe I was thinking of a 1,000 watt amp when I was looking to purchase a new one. I have it hooked up to a 10\\"" Kicker Solobaric sub. It does have nice bass to it, but I expected more.",3,1
"I got this for the screen protector and the silicone cases, but the quality received is pretty low. The retractable cord is a little glitchy and I would never think of putting my Ipod Touch in a magnetic case. I mean really. There's a lot of things in this bundle, and all of them are adequate, but none are standouts.",3,1
"The cover itself is ok, but was very disappointed with the color!! Not as lime of a green as I was wanting..",3,2
"I was marginally dissapointed in the condition of this IPOD, but then maybe my expectations were too high.  I am using it only as a backup to my other classic Ipod and it is working just fine.",3,2

Remove the electronics from the original unit and transfer after the key has been cut by a locksmith. Works great and save at least 50% of the dealer prices.,3,1
"They finally arrived, and I am grateful my son actually received his Christmas gift that I ordered on 12/15, though it came at the end of January.",3,1
"Pros:    -Lots of room for my classical, pop and radio broadcasts I've recorded from the internet.   -Decent sound (though I recommend using different headphones)  -Drag and drop functionality. I didn't have to install software. It shows up as another hard drive and you can create folders using Windows Explorer  -Great features like a sleep timer, equalizer, different types of stereo, shuffles, etc.  -Battery life is MUCH longer than the FY 200.    Cons:  - It does have a flimsy case. I wonder how long that is going to last. It feels fragile and cheap.  - You have to remove the player from the cover in order to use the USB connector.    I haven't had any of the freezing problems that others have reported (though it seems that almost every player has reviewers who make the same complaint.) I don't take these complaints seriously because who knows whether the review's computer has a software conflict or whether they've ever done a Scan Disk.    Update: After 3 weeks or normal use, my computer does not recognise it when I plug it into the USB port. After a call to the service department, it seems that the retractible USB connection is broken and will need to be fixed, at my expense.    My advice is to pass this one by for something that is less flimsy and will stand the test of time. It's a shame. I've had the FY 200 for a couple years and have been happy with it. I only bought this for the extra storage.",3,1

"holds my 1st gen nook well, but the way it opens is a bit awkward and not native to a book reader. The plaid isn't as matte as it is in the picture, it's a bit more glossy. But I serves the function and isn't an eyesore.",3,1
Nothing to brag about - nothing to gripe about.  Not so sure that it charges the device but the adapter allows it to run on car battery power while the car is running.   Other people have complained about the length and/or quality of the cord. This is not an issue in either of my vehicles.,3,2
"Was it a design I was looking for? Yes. Did I want a hard cover to protect my ipod? Yes. Did I want it to be too complicated and HARD to take off? No! This HARD ( difficult) cover is pleasing when you want it to protect your ipod and the doggy paws are real cute and the colors are neutral so its great. However, I wanted a hard cover that would do the trick but that would also be easy to take apart so i could charge it on my ihome and put it back on, when I'm on the go and have it look real cute( I'm a girl so, yeah). This hard cover is really hard to take off! I am not the kind of girl who gets her nails done but ladies, if you try to take this apart, I'm real sure you ill break and injure your nails. I literally had to use this handy tool that is thin like a bobby pin but way better. It is used to tighten instruments nails  which secure the keys. For example, a flute.That is the only way I can take that cover apart. I had to order one of those ipod chargers that you plug into the wall in order for me to keep this cover on my ipod  but its a real pain when you want to switch covers and you simply cant! At least not the easy way. It feels like if you try your hardest it'll break but it hasn't happened but for some reason I received two of them when I bought one so if anything happens I've got an extra.",3,1
"I like the idea behind this but it seems a little expensive for what you get.    The flexible neck is much shorter than you think it's going to be.  It would be better, especially in the cup holder version, if the neck were longer.    The part that actually holds the player has some drawbacks.  It's a generic part that Gomadic seems to use with pretty much all their car mounts. This same mount/holder works for my iPod and GPS if I needed it to.  Since it's generic, the adjustable parts tend to get in the way of the Archos 5's power port.  This leads to an unstable grasp on the player if you want to have it plugged in too (it does stay well enough if you tighten the clamp really tight, just make sure not to bump it too much).    Another problem with the clamp part being generic is that it easily comes off the flexible neck.  It becomes really annoying if someone in the car bumps the mount and the entire part comes off.  Then you have to fumble around to try and put it back on (hopefully not while driving).  Seems like a locking mechanism would have been better then just a slide on clip.    The ability to quickly install and remove a player is a really nice feature.  The release trigger is a littler awkward to get to if you have small hands.    Durability of this product is questionable.  I've been using this for about 3-4 months now and the quick release trigger is becoming difficult to press.  It seems like the teeth on the gears that push the clamp apart may be getting chewed up just from regular usage.",3,1
"This a great case it feels nice look nice and is nice, but there is one major flaw in my opinion. There isn't really a shock absorber on the case. Like if you drop it on the speaker end of the case it'll hit plastic and has a chance of cracking the ipod. That goes for all corners of the case the silicon isn't all that thick on the edges. I would recommend the survivor case by griffin because it offer more protection in my opinion.",3,1

"Ok you really want to know about this receiver? It's very good when it works. My first week with it is like helter skelter. Let me break it down;<br /><br />Looks:<br />unless you have a flat dash a double din unit looks like a add on. My dash has a angled curve to it so this unit doesnt look like a part of the car. I figure any double din will have this problem though, my factory unit was angled. other than the angle the unit looks good.<br /><br />Performance:<br />The unit is loaded with features but it really changed the sound in my car compared to the Kenwood unit it replaced. It just doesnt sound as good on the low end, but the mid to high end is very good.<br /><br />Remote:<br />Whoever designed the remote is a total idiot that probably never used a remote in a car! it's made like a keychain remote. its small with the volume buttons on the bottom so they are not easy or convenient to get at which is not good if you need to turn it down quickly to avoid getting a loud music ticket. also you get only folder up & down and forward and back, then there is a mute and Sound button. No way to adjust the bass only, just a button that steps through the EQ (flat, natural, bass, dynamic, user) no phone button, no way to use the phone without picking it up, unless you fiddle around on the front of the radio, its really been kinda useless.<br /><br />Bluetooth:<br />When using bluetooth it constantly shows \\""No Audio Device\\"" so far for the last week its been hit or miss as to whether or not the bluetooth is gonna work. You get in the can and it comes on, then you stop for gas and get back into the car and it wont work. very frustrating.<br /><br />USB:<br />The USB is just as hit or miss as the bluetooth, same problem, it might work when you step into the car or it might not, if it does dont cut the car off to run in a store, or stop for gas cause it may not work again for the rest of the day. When you plug it in, it wont go back to the last track you where listening to, it always starts from the beginning which on my phone is a folder that holds ring tones.<br /><br />CD Player:<br />Who knows? do people still use them? I havent even attempted. I bought this to stream over bluetooth or USB.<br /><br />Radio:<br />Well I at least listened to the radio, because I couldnt get the USB or bluetooth to work, it was ok, but who listens to radio anymore? I was supposed to be able to use Pandora right? I dont think so... it hasnt worked either. I really havent tried to figure out how to get pandora going, everything else haas already got me frustrated enough.<br /><br />Software:<br />JVC Smart remote is cool with the gestures but it doesnt show the names or any other artist info, I find it useless to be honest. Then theres JVC music control, its a good App I like it but it doesnt have the gestures built in so WTF? why not? OK no biggie but why is it constantly analyzing the songs? I have 529 songs on my phone and I keep my phone on 24/7 so for the past seven days its been analyzing everytime I look at it. so far its at 197 songs, hmmm doesnt sound right to me.<br /><br />Volume Knob:<br />Dont hit a bump or be driving on a rough road because the volume knob is so sensitive you'll be accidentally pushing it in and muting the music.<br /><br />In summary I do like the unit though it has its flaws, but I dont think I can live with it. It sounds more like it was made by Coby. Before buying this unit I checked the compatibility guide on the JVC website and I showed that I should have been good with my HTC Thunderbolt so that isnt supposed to be an issue. I think tomorrow I'll try to reset the unit and if that doesnt do it I'll be sending it back.<br /><br />I have a 2007 Toyota Corrolla S, Soundstorm SX10 crossover, Soundstorm EV1600.4 running Kenwood 6 3/4 components in front and Kenwoord 6x9 5 ways rear, also I have a Hifonics HFi 1500 running two American Bass XD 12 dual VC at 1 ohm, and a Soundstream Capcell 400.

"If what you want is a continuous tone piezo - i.e. a &#34;beeper&#34; - then this one would get 5  or maybe 4 stars.  (Possibly dock one star because it's a bit quiet for the rated sound level.)  However, if what you wanted was the thing described in the listing - i.e. a *buzzer*, for example something that would make the sound you get if you answer incorrectly on a game show &#34;bzzzzt&#34; - then it's 3 stars at best.

"Price was right if you consider what Apple charges.  Shipping was reasonably quick, but the tools are worthless. Even the cheesy little Philips head screwdriver didn't work.  It was to large for the screws. The plastic case tools were so weak they broke or bent instantly.  And what the heck would you need a thin guitar pick for?  Why bother sending them?   Imagine that. No instructions or recommendations.  How hard would it be to print one sheet of black and white paper with a few clues?   The battery I had lasted about 30 minutes.  The replacement does give me a couple more hours based on what I'm doing with my phone. The cost was pretty cheap, but overall, I got what I paid for.",3,2

"I have an older Garmin Nuvi that I needed to move to a dash mount.  This does the trick nicely, although I encountered several problems.      First, the included adhesive discs don't provide enough adhesion on an angled and textured service like my Dodge Intrepid's dashboard.  I added a drop of silicon adhesive to seal the deal.     Second, the fit of the mounting ball will be a little loose on some Garmin devices, like mine.  I've had to add a little adhesion to the ball portion to keep my Garmin Nuvi from slowly angling downward due to road vibration.    Still, it does what it says.  I'm sure that the ball must fit a little better with some newer units and the adhesion would work better on different dashboards.  Given that I was able to solve both problems in under a minute with a few dollops from a $2 tube of silicon, I'd say it works fine.",3,1

"They weren't too hard to install - just found 12v power under the seat and attached them to those for power.  They are fancy looking.  Those are the pros.  Here's the reality:  The instruction manual SUCKS.  And there's nothing helpful online.  The headphones are pretty, but with the car actually driving on the highway, the volume is so low, the kids can't hear the movies.  I would have to say the absolute most irritating thing about these (just got back from a road trip, so I'm all fired up right now) is how obnoxiously loud the buttons are!  Every time the kids touch the buttons on the monitor (power/volume/input, etc) the beep that comes out of the unit is ear piercingly loud and there is nothing in any menu anywhere to shut off that godforsaken sound.  It's like a dying baby tarydactyl screaming for it's mother over a loudspeaker in a tunnel.  My son was so mad that he couldn't hear the movie through his crap headphones, he kept hitting the volume up button and I had to come home to take motrin because I yelled like 8 times to get him to stop touching the stupid buttons.  It was like chinese water torturer.  I was two milliseconds away from pulling over on the side of the highway and throwing them out the window.  Please please please, if there is a rockville employee out there somewhere reading this, respond if there is a way to shut off that horrendous noise.  The point of rear dvd entertainment and children is the magic of silence in the car.  Fire the person who made sound come out of those buttons.  Immediately.

"Overall for the price a decent unit.  The plug for connecting the radio is goofy though, at a glance it looks like it would fit the dual speaker/mic connections which are standard on most radios - it doesn't.  The GSI connections are closer together, won't fit my Icom or Yaesu.  I got it to work using a splitter and shaving the sides of the plug off so I could squeeze both of them onto the GSI prong.  IF they gave you two separate plugs it would be MUCH more usable.<br /><br />Otherwise it seems to be a decent unit.  Wire grade is semi-flexible at Alaska-cold temperatures, and craftsmanship seems to be good. It's really nice having the dual speakers, most of the others are only a speaker on one side.  With a stereo splitter I can listen to my iPod and be on the radio at the same time, pretty cool, I can hear it in both ears but it's not is stereo due to the mono plug they use on the GSI.<br /><br />PTT switch is good.  Connections between the segments are a little slow to plug in / unplug.  Getting a lot of wind noise in the mic when I xmit, will have to do a little work to my helmet.",3,1

Horizontally, length was about 2\\"" too long and the width was about a .5\\"" off. This is not to say I easily cut and fit them myself, but the title of their product is misleading.

"I purchased the SMH10 to replace my Parrot SK4000. That unit was discontinued and too old to pair with by new Blackberry. My review may not be fair because I don't need intercom. I only use a GPS, phone and MP3 player.<br /><br />I will start with the negatives. I was very disappointed that the unit does not offer FM radio like my Parrot. I use my bike for work around NYC all day and I primarily listen to radio. I tried internet radio, but my phone battery went dead within 1 or 2 hrs. I can only listen to MP3s on my smart phone with the Sena and only some of the music player functions are remote. I must start the player manually, but can skip and control volume with the jog dial. This is a pain because the player has stopped working a few times while I was on the highway and I have to stop to restart it. Music typically resumes after a hang up from a phone call I received, but will not restart if I made the call. I could control all of these feature using the remote control on my handle bars with my Parrot SK4000. Maybe a smart phone with better voice command software would work for the Sena, but the Blackberry apps are too limited and Vlingo doesn't work because it does not rely on the side key. You may still have problems with any voice command software because the Sena appears to lack a noise canceling feature since I can not make calls using voice command over 30 mph. I never had this problem with my SK4000 and most people could not tell I was on a bike even at 65 mph.<br /><br />Now for the positives. The sound quality is much better than the Parrot. It's so loud that I can listen to music with my ear plugs in. The jog dial is very easy to learn and work. The Sena is quick changing at 2 hrs and the battery life is nice and long. Customer service has also been been very good.<br /><br />I will continue to use my SK4000 for work with all my calls forwarded to an old cell phone I have and will only use the Sena for long trips. I just returned from Americaid in Lake George in the rain, then rode to Maryland and back home to NYC. The unit preformed will, but I think will become better in it's future incarnations.",3,2

"I would have expected this to fit better than it does on my iPhone 3Gs, 4, and 4s.  I've tried this on multiple iPhones, in and out of cases, and it always seems like an awkward fit.  Almost like I'm going to break something.  It doesn't plug in well, as with most iPhone connectors.  That being said, when it's plugged in, it works as advertised.  Next time, I'll probably go with another brand.",3,1
It does work but it requires my phone volume to be all the way up and the stereo volume to be most of the way up.  At these levels there is background noise that is quite noticeable when the music stops.  I would not buy again,3,2
"I had little difficulty applying the protector after watching the video on how to do it a couple times.  Not sure I'm liking how it's made the screen look though.  No air bubbles, the few I had pushed out easy enough.  Just makes things less crisp than without the protector.  I do plan on using my Kindle to read a lot while in the sun this summer, so I'm going to leave it on for now.  I've already experienced glare from the sun and difficulty trying to read just while sitting in my car in the afternoon.  Had to reposition the Kindle so I wasn't seeing my reflection, which made it difficult to read.  Hoping this helps and I get used to the way it looks.",3,1
It's hard to navigate the folder system and I've had it just freeze up a couple of times.,3,2
"I ordered this for my daughter's 5th generation iPod classic.  The color is absolutely perfect for her, and it does look really strong.<br /><br />The problem is that I can't get the dang thing on!  I see some reviews in other colors having the same complaint, and I really think this should be marketed more to the 6th generation iPod classic, which is thinner from front to back.  I got the skin on halfway, even used a membership club credit card to attempt to wiggle it on bit by bit, but I just couldn't get it to budge any more.  I haven't returned it, but will try to slip it on again if anyone has any suggestions.  Yes, I did clean it thoroughly with Screen Cleaner before trying.",3,1
"Color is nice, the size is as it is described but I am not overly impressed with it. It will work for it's intended purpose and I guess it's better than not having a case at all. It doesn't have much cushion to it and is very thin.",3,2
"Looks great and is accurately portrayed in description. However, the case does not completely lock shut at the top, so there is a small gap since it is not securely closed. If dropped, the case would probably break, so my 8-year-old has to be careful with it. Coming with a stylus was a bonus.",3,1
"I use my scooter for my works and needed a producto like this, but I've some minor complains. It takes almost 8 seconds to pair woth my Blackberry 8520 and some times it doesn't complete the pairing (it only pair 2 of the 3 modes available. The other thing is that the cradle that fits in the external part of he helmet it doesn't fit exactly secure (you feel that the device is very loose -but never fell-). The last thing is that you have to press very hard the bottons in the control to increase or decrease the volume.",3,1
I ordered this for my two way radio. Only to find that it doesn't work for mine. So I really can't give a review on the item other than quality which is ok for what I paid. That said costumer service was excellent.,3,1
i got this screen and when i opened it it was cracked it works i put it on but it is still cracked and its missing a piece of glass at the bottom all i want is a replacement i like it its just cracked,3,2
"I bought this product expecting several things. Mostly what I wanted, however, was a simple dock that had a remote. The included cables and such were just a plus to me. <br /> <br />I came home disappointed with it and returned it the next day. <br /> <br />It's basically $100 for a piece of plastic and some cords that allow you to connect the iPod to your TV/Stereo. To me, that's a rip off. I just didn't realize it at the time. To others, it might be worth it, because all of the extra included equipment (dock, remote, and chords) which would cost way more than $100 bought separately. But to me, the average person who just wanted a simple dock, it was definitely not worth the price tag. <br /> <br />The only functions I found myself liking was the ability to charge the device and play music/videos at the same time. The remote was also a bonus, but at the same time, it's not terribly functional. It was easier to just get up the 4 feet to where my iPod was docked, and manually control it's functions, rather than line up the IR remote directly with the dock and fiddle with some buttons. <br /> <br />One problem that really got me annoyed was the fact that the volume doesn't adjust (using the volume control buttons on the remote) when you dock your iPod and plug in speakers to the headphone/speaker jack. The volume up/down and the mute/unmute buttons on the remote essentially become useless at that point. Most likely the volume buttons on the remote control the *Docks* volume only, and not the iPod's volume. So if you connect powered speakers to the iPod's headphone jack, forget volume adjustment across the room. <br /> <br />I contacted DLO support about that serious engineering fault, but to this date I have gotten no response.    <br /> <br />In summary, this dock probably isn't for the average person who just wants a simple iPod dock. It's more geared for people with home stereos that can be used in conjunction with the iPod, and people who want to connect their iPod to the TV for various reasons. If you fit that description, you'll probably save money buying this combo. Otherwise I suggest looking for another dock.",3,2
"Don't expect to get what you see and maybe what they say (NEW). The suction cup mount isn't as pictured. And as for being new, there were deep scratches by the Micro SD slot and the plastic protector on the screen seems to have been removed then replaced sloppily. Camera works ok. Picture is clear but battery only lasted about an hour.<br />It was listed as free shipping but I bought it using the fast checkout and did not get the free shipping.",3,2
"It charges quickly enough via USB cable and has enough capacity to charge my phone back up 2.5 times.  However, even with the additional solar panel add on, it recharges PAINFULLY slowly in the sun.  After three days of full sun it finally reached 50%.  I did \\""condition\\"" the battery by charging and fully draining several times, and I did remove the film from both the base unit and the solar panel add on.",3,1
"This item is a great, secure fit for my Garmin 1300. Do not order it without the rest of the mounting. It is not complete as shown on the website.",3,1
Worked great for a while then started getting this device is not supported message.  They are cheap so for the month of use I guess it works.,3,2
"Fragile feel, not surprising given the price.  It works to play MP3 books over my car stereo using the auxiliary port, which is what I bought it for.  However, it badly needs a manual (a downloadable one would be fine) beyond the 7.5\\""x3.45\\"" (approx) sheet provided (mostly occupied by diagrams that have button labels that don't all match the device); that sheet doesn't even list all the options.  For example, one menu item is \\""Camera\\"", which isn't even mentioned on the sheet.  It took a while to figure out how to use the camera.  Also, there's no obvious way to delete files just using this device, if you just took an inadvertent picture and wanted to erase it, for example.  The only way I have found (so far) to delete files is via connecting the player to my computer as a removable drive.",3,1
"I replaced a Mio C220 that I'd had for almost 5 years.  It cost $180, but the R403 was $90.  The configuration changes were much easier by comparison...more intuitive.  If hardware and software has to be navigated via a 200 page manual, it's too complex(with the necessary exceptions, of course).  A GPS should not be so complex a manual is necessary to read (to have, yes, but not forced to read).  The navigation compared to the C220 is not better in the routes it chooses.  The lane guidance is great and works without a problem.  There will never be a GPS that will pick a route that is best because it is better than other choices.  It will pick what is configured to be fastest, shortest, cheapest, etc..  One option that needs to be included is to exclude neighborhood streets.  I've tested it and found the C220 to more my liking, but it's broken and I'm not about to go \\""backwards\\"".  When I've chosen a different route then it gives, it doesn't endlessly try to re-route me back.  It moves on as it should.  I have navigation through my phone, but it's slower when going through city streets.  I've missed turns because of that.  I chose the Mio because I'd have one before and as it would turn out, the power adaptor for the C220 works for the R403 as well.  There are not many details given here, because the liking of a GPS unit is fairly subjective.",3,1
Not well pleased that for this to work the phone cannot have a case on it. The audio cord is not of decent length for large smartphones unles phone is positioned more than midway up.,3,2
I purchased this adaptor primarily for when I go camping.  I have a spare 12V battery that I use to power all of my electronics while sitting around the campfire. It works but is slow to charge.  At least I can use it without discharging the internal battery.,3,1
"for the size and ease of transporting these little speakers are and excellent buy.  BUT, they quit after only two months.",3,1
"I put the batteries into this walkie talkie system and at first my daughter and I were talking back and forth and we were having fun even though it was really full of static.  But, then in the midst of our fun, another voice answered me instead of my daughter, we laughed it off until the man kept answering me.  I got a little spooked and turned the walkie talkies off and put them away, not actually sure if I will let my daughter have them back anytime soon.",3,1
"Everything worked as explained in product overview.  I did have problem conneting device to my older computer for some reason.  Connects to my laptop perfect with windows xp.  I was used to ipod music selection, this device took me a while to get used to finding my music.  Shuffle option is different from ipod if you pass a song you like, pressing back will only shuffle the songs more.  Display is not as bright as other comparable devices, hard to see when driving in car with sunglasses.  Video files and pictures are stored in same folder as music.  It also came with a stylus which is helpful but nowhere to store stylus on device making it hard to keep up with.  All in all good device for the money, just takes a little getting used to I would suggest trying out in a store to save the hassle of returning if you don't like it.",3,1
Be sure to check out Garmin's web pages directly for this.  Map prices have been coming down lately and you will get the latest version too.,3,1
Did not the 4th generation shuffle. Which was my mistake when ordering however it does not fit the docking station on the Sony cd/stereo system,3,2
The screen protector came bent because it was in a paper envelope. The case itself doesn't fit very well. I guess that's to be expected for this price range.,3,2
It does the job.,3,1
I'm surprised this product has such great feedback.  I purchased two and neither works very well. They don't fully charge my Samsung Galaxy S2 and at times when I connect it to my phone (and other people's phones) it will continuously beep to show that it is connected then disconnected  and this will continue until I unplug it.,3,1
"Pretty much \\""you get what you paid for\\"".<br />Pros:<br />Can play flash video<br />Light Weight<br />Multi-function(picture, video, text file display(ebook), voice recorder, camera, FM radio)<br />Low price<br /><br />Cons:<br />Had to try several times pluging-unpluging USB cable to different USB ports of my computer to get it recognized<br />Can't delete any files directly from the device<br />Have to manually organize file by creating different folders<br />Battery doesn't hold charge very well<br /><br />Overall, everthing works but not very well.",3,2
"Made to hold 2 batteries (not 1), but that isn't in the description.  I needed a battery holder that only holds 1 battery.  Tip:  To hold only 1 battery, the terminal needs to be bent downward to have enough pressure to hold and maintain contact with the battery.  I was able to make these work, but would have preferred an accurate description.  Shipping took a while (I think they come from FAR FAR away), but that was to be expected.",3,2
"this holder thing does NOT stay on my ipod if i put my ipod in a coat or backpack pocket. it falls off super easily but, then again, i paid like $3 for it or something. it def does a $3 job. but nothing more. the color is great, though!",3,1
"Great sound. I wish the charge held longer. When it's ready to run out, it only beeps a few time, then that's it.",3,1
"I'll be blunt, it isn't a great product.  It's a bit flimsy, if the louvers on your air vent are vertical instead of horizontal it wobbles from side to side, and you have to push the buttons very hard to make it release the GPS unit.  Why does it even get three stars? Because I've tried the alternatives.  The mounts that attach to the windshield with a suction cup not only tend to fall off at the most inopportune moments, they also obstruct your vision while driving (as does the power cord that hangs from it).  Using those types of mounts on a dash you find that they won't attach to a dashboard that has any sort of curve or any sort of texture.  Ever seen a car that had a dashboard like that?  The nonskid beanbag mounts that supposedly stay in place while you're driving don't.  Even with it's imperfections, this mount is much better than the other alternatives.  It works, and you can live with it.  If you don't have a GPS built into your car, this is about as good as it gets, and it's cheap enough to just buy another when it eventually breaks on you.",3,1
"The item indeed fits its description though not completely in a satisfactory manner, for the material used in it is kinda cheap. Also, it has no protection against scratches on the touch screen (i.e. it has no protective cover whatsoever, it only protects your device from scratches in the back).<br /><br />This item is described as a WATCHband and indeed you would have to wear it as a WATCH.<br /><br />IT IS NOT GOOD FOR SPORTS<br /><br />Read the other review:<br />&#34;This item came as described and it fits perfect I was concerned with the ipod falling out when I ran but it stays put. I used a different band for it though.&#34;<br /><br />-&#62; &#34;I USED A DIFFERENT BAND FOR IT THOUGHT&#34;<br /><br />The band that comes with is does not hold the iPod in its place not will it fit your arm.<br /><br />If you're just looking for an IPOD CASE, this is ok, but if you want it for SPORTS, this is not ok, that's why a 3/5",3,1
"The case works, but it should really have more cushion inside. The GPS still has room to move around inside when it is carried, which means it isn't very well protected from damage. This defeats the reason I bought the case.<br /><br />Also, the screen protectors are just a tad shorter than the actual length of the screen, although the height is the same.",3,1
"This little gizmo is great to recharge your phone on the go, but it's a one time deal per charge up that gives you about half a battery charge if you don't use the phone while it's charging. Not great if you know you have to rely on it or are going to use it often, however, it's a very nice, small size that is travel or pocket friendly. If you're looking for a portable charger that's going to give you a full charge and is completely reliable for such a thing, this isn't it. If you're looking for something as a &#34;just in case&#34; kind of situation, this is perfect.",3,1
"I have used this case for a while for my kindle DX and absolutely love it. I like it so much I bought the same style case for my iPad. I don't love it so much for my iPad. I have a Zagg screen protector on my iPad, and the plastic corners at the top keep trying to lift the screen protector. Not much can lift a Zagg screen protector but these plastic straps are managing it. Would definitely not recommend this for the ipad2, but highly recommend it for a kindle DX.",3,1
Great product if my lock-in clamps didn't come bent and broken. Also had to cut out some of the dash just to make it fit. Would be nice if you guys would send me the proper clamps so I can securely lock it in place.,3,1
"... this one at least didn't come broken like the last one. It is basically the same OEM case sold by several distributors on the web. But for around $4 including shipping, what would one expect? It is a disposable case that should give a few months decent coverage until the weak hinge breaks on the clip. Just spend another $4- I haven't found any better options for a case with a clip.",3,2
"After playing with this unit for couple days I decided to return it. The unit has average sound for its size and I'm get better sound from a smaller coosh speaker. What's really annoying is that every time unit is turned on, paired, or connected via aux there is a voice confirmation in a funny at first accent that gets old very quickly. I just want the unit to play the music not to talk to me especially because there are only two inputs and I know if I'm using aux or bluetooth. Also when volume button is held to turn it up to the max the speaker lets a very strong beep to let you know it can't go any louder. This too is annoying. Buttons can be hit and miss and they function only when you feel them click under your finger.<br />I liked that the unit has a rubber foot which keeps it from moving around from vibration. It paired quickly and reliably but the range was a problem. My wifi could be interfering with it so I think I'll go with long range unit with stronger bluetooth reception.<br /><br />Overall a decent unit that looks nice but can be more polished for better experience.",3,1
It's OK but not worth the price,3,1
not enough space for cords,3,1
"I just purchased this product and as far as sound quality they are excellent; however, the remote control tracking buttons do not work on my iPod touch2 and my ipad2.  The play/pause center switch works fine.  The tracking buttons would be a great feature if they worked.  Has anyone experienced this problem?",3,1
"Don't do it unless you have to. It is light, takes up no room, and looks \\""pretty\\"" good. It will tip over if you do not secure it. The sub seems good, but why no 2 ohm version? Most will not run 1 single 10 inch sub at 4 ohms. Todays amps just don't produce the \\""true\\"" power at 4 ohms unless you spend a fortune and go way overboard with an amp that takes up more room than this box. Buy it if you have no choice because the quality is there. Remember to not expect miracles out of 1 - 10 inch sub in a .35 cubic foot box.",3,2
"Not much to say other than it is what it is.  I would never use it for anything other than something solid to attach it to... it needs solid support to mount it, otherwise you will not be happy with it.",3,1
"I agree with William Wallace, I too had the misfortune of the speakers dying on me, although it was after a year and a half. It turned out the power supply had died and after buying a cheap replacement from Hong Kong, I was back in business.    For the first month, the speakers were flawless, however, they started to develop an annoying rattle from the bass port after that time (it wasn't the iPod rattling in its cradle like other reviewers had experienced since it happens without an iPod attached as well). I opened the speakers up and tightened every screw I could find inside but alas, the rattling remains, so I simply keep it at lower levels and play less bass heavy material (not so easy if I have it connected to the computer while watching a Blu Ray...    All in all, I was satisfied but I would definitely have liked them to have lasted longer, both in sound fidelity and power supply.",3,2
"UPDATE:<br />After 18 months this thing is tattered. It has peeled back and does not hold to the form.  Tons of gunk in underneath that peels off.  The indentations and nicks on the plastic make it difficult to see the display, though admittedly this is better than having scratches on the device.<br /><br />This is the 2nd one of these I have owned (first iPod & protector got too close to the hot tub).<br />When I removed the first cover after over a year it was in like new condition on the outside.<br />The lifetime guarantee and replacement makes this a relatively risk free option, and is much cheaper than continually buying new face covers.",3,2
"When I got the package, it was well packaged in the box. I think the pictures are little miss leading. I see in the picture that the clear case I would think  be for the arm band, or even the black silcone sleave one. But neither are. They do not have any slits, you would have to make your own. The clear case, from other pictures did show it has a clip, that would allow you to keep it standing up, on its side. It does not come with a clip at all, just a clear plastic hard case. The long power cord. (not the retactable one). For some reason, seems to be too big to fit into my ipod. I had to kinda force it in, and it did not work when plugged into the power addapter. The retractable cord does work in both. The fish to wrap my earbuds around is great! I did not hse the included ear buds, because I have my own that I bought for comfort. The JVC jell buds, with mic. Everything else seems fine, beside the few complaints. For the price I can't complain. You get what you pay for.",3,1
"I was optimistic this unit would be the answer to my prayers for a reliable swim radio/MP3 player. Unfortunately, those prayers were not answered.  While this thing appears to be sturdy, the control buttons are small, the menu can be confusing, and it can take a while to figure out which button does what. But the killer is that this device is NOT waterproof. After a few exposures to water, it becomes schizophrenic and eventually freezes. After this discovery, I would downgrade my rating to 1 star because it does not perform as advertised.",3,2
"You know when you buy a watch or a new cell phone and it comes with a cheap piece of plastic overlaying the screen to protect it in shipping?  Well, this is basically the same thing - the difference being that the factory screen overlay is applied in a dust free environment by a machine designed to do it, whereas you will be trying to apply this with your fingers in a room in your house or apartment.  Best bet: if you want a piece of plastic on your screen, leave the factory one on.",3,1
Have any one tried this on HTC M8? Is this really compatible with HTC M8? Or can anybody recommend an MHL HDMI adapter compatible with HTC M8.,3,2
"I literally had ONE cassette tape that I needed saved onto my harddrive.. and this did the trick.<br /><br />I plopped a tester cassette in and tried to close the door but it wouldn't stay shut! I shrugged and just set my iphone on top of the case to keep it shut, worked just fine for me. i played the tape and listened to it from my computer, and the quality transferred fairly, but the speed was at like... 1.7.. everyone sounded like mice. I just slowed the audio down to normal speed in editing and now I've got my tape all transferred and I'm satisfied. I'm even keeping the damn thing in case I need it again.. but honestly.. this thing couldn't survive more than a couple more uses.<br /><br />Just about everything that could have gone wrong with this thing DID go wrong.. but I'm giving it 3 stars because it did what I needed it to do in the end. BUT if you plan on KEEPING your hard copy tapes, I recommend you not buy this.. it did quite a number on my original.",3,1
"This speaker is cute and small , so it's good for traveling but it wasn't much louder than my tablet speaker. The one difference was the base it provided. Okay buy but if you want more than base I suggest you buy one like the pill. More money but way more volume.",3,1
was a little disappointed that it did not include the glue tape nor the plastic that secures the glass in its place for reinstall but overall i made things work and its fixed,3,2
"These are cute, come in pretty clear for the price you pay. But they do run through batteries fairly quick even when you really make sure to turn them off.",3,1
"I bought this as a gift for my teen son.  It seemed rather nice at first, he was content with it, but it didn't take long before the ear plug hole gave out and he could no longer use the device without a lot of wiggling of the cord to hear.  He quickly became very unsatisfied with his gift.",3,1
"I use it for a few days, until I got my screen protection, the screen protection stick on the plastic, no recomended If you using. A screen protection. Although it keep it safe.",3,1
"Works for 3gs and higher, other than that i doesn't work for 3g at all, but you get what you pay for as usual, i bought it for a 3g phone, but we could still use it for our 3gs phones",3,1
its alright,3,1
this is a very good pre amp it cleans up your music and raises the volume to your system by about 30 % why i gived it 3 stars because the bass does not give u the epicenter effect i was looking for  and to adjust the master gain on top is a pain,3,1
"&#34;Excellent item. The only down side is I cannot find a software or cable that work with it on any operating system of any year, so unfortunately programming it is not really an option.&#34;",3,2
It's a fair price for the item.  What I can't understand is why there is a different price for the different colors.  Basically you get what you paid for.,3,2
"As a buyer of well-over 300 Baofeng radios (and counting) for the group I belong to (not all of which were purchased through Amazon but many were), I'm always amazed at the lengths some sellers go to to hype their products as being \\""newer\\"" or \\""better\\"" than other models, or perhaps (to give them the benefit of the doubt) they just don't know any better.<br /><br />First, the Baofeng UV-5R series (including the original and still extremely popular UV-5R, I'll explain why in a minute) is what is normally referred to by many as a SDR radio (or software defined radio).  While not a true SDR product (you can't use it with your computer to control the radio's functions or scan a wide amount of VHF/UHF frequencies with it), none the less a large chip is programmed on the circuit board built inside each radio.  That chip determines what capability the radio itself can perform.<br /><br />Every UV-5R series radio has the ability to transmit from 136-174 MHz on VHF and from 400-520 MHz on UHF in both narrow-band and wide-band modes (very useful for the occasional FRS or MURS use, which requires narrow-band mode to work correctly).<br /><br />Every model does \\""at least\\"" 4W on VHF/UHF from the factory, but occasionally you'll get a batch that does 4.5W or even 5W out, but the difference between 4W and 5W is minimal at best.  A 4W radio with a better antenna will easily outperform a 5W radio with the standard crappy antenna that Baofeng ships on ALL (including the UV-5RA, -5RA+, -5RAX, and -5RAX+) models.<br /><br />Baofeng DOES NOT program those chips any differently for the UV-5R vs. any other UV-5R series (including the UV-5RA+).  Version 307 of the firmware (which is the most current release I have in any of my radios) works EXACTLY the same way as previous older releases of firmware at least back to the 295 release (over a year ago), so any claim from a seller that this release provides additional features (at least from a user's perspective) is simply BOGUS, since the firmware inside both radios have the same features.  In fact, my UV-5R radios with the 307 firmware release is EXACTLY the same radio (inside and within the firmware) as my UV-5RA+ radios with the 307 firmware release.<br /><br />Second, you CANNOT in any way upgrade the firmware (unless you count buying a different radio and it comes with a different firmware release), so again the claim in the listing (from some sellers) that you can is simply BOGUS.<br /><br />Third, you can believe that two thinner pieces (glued or screwed together on the faceplate of the UV-5RA+) is somehow stronger than one thicker piece of plastic (on the original UV-5R series) if you like (and maybe it is), but I haven't seen that in real-world use from my own UV-5RA+ units.  The standard UV-5R units that we use seem to hold up just as well (when dropped in the desert dirt or rolling down a hill) as any other Baofeng radio we own and use.<br /><br />Fourth, and my biggest issue with all of the non-standard UV-5RA, UV-5RA+, UV-5RAX and UV-5RAX+ units, is that NONE of the Baofeng battery accessories (except the little 1800 mAh standard battery) work WITHOUT modification (unless you use a Dremel tool to grind or cut off part of your extended battery that works on the standard UV-5R - but won't work on your UV-5RA, UV-5RA+, UV-5RAX or UV-5RAX+).<br /><br />Getting new UV-5RA+ units that don't work with Extended 3800 mAh batteries (without modification) doesn't make my group happy.  That may not bother you, but NONE of the sellers of the non-standard UV-5RA, UV-5RA+, UV-5RAX, and UV-5RAX+ units ever seem to mention that lack of hardware compatibility in their listings, so buyer beware!<br /><br />BTW, NONE of the \\""AA\\"" or \\""AAA\\"" battery shell packs work on the UV-5RA, UV-5RA+, UV-5RAX, or UV-5RAX+ units either, so that's 3 different battery accessories (including the 3800 mAh extended battery) that you can't use on these radios without hacking them with a Dremel tool (but they all work without modification on the original UV-5R units).<br /><br />So \\""if\\"" you want a \\""pretty\\"" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (-5RA+, -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.  Oh, you should see how well that shiny faceplate lights up when a flashlight hits it in the dark, just the thing you don't want for night use.<br /><br />Virtually every guy in our group ends up carrying a standard UV-5R and giving the UV-5RA, -5RA+, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ to the wife or kids, since the wife and/or kids rarely care about the other accessories working and they (the wife and kids) tend to like the \\""pretty\\"" radios, but again there is NO INTERNAL difference and NO EXTRA FEATURES in the UV-5RA, -5RA+, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ units (other than a different looking shiny faceplate) vs. the original and still wildly popular UV-5R (which I refer to as the M16 of radios, as all the accessories you match it up with just plain work).<br /><br />Now you know the real background on these radios.ion on the original UV-5R units).<br /><br />So \\""if\\"" you want a \\""pretty\\"" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (-5RA+, -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.

okay good,3,1
"I bought a pair of these and have been using them for about 2 weeks.<br /><br />Pros:<br />  * Very portable and convenient to move around<br /><br />Cons:<br />  * Sound quality<br />  * Difficult to pair with another device<br /><br />In regards to the sound quality; the speaker sounds raspy, almost like it's blown. Both speakers exhibit the same issue, I tried pairing with a second device; no luck. I even returned a set an got a new one; same result. Not all music sounds raspy, softer music get's raspy as the volume increases, rock/pop sounds raspy at any volume. Needless to say, I'm only keeping it for the portability as that is a benefit and it's probably the best speaker right now for that purpose.<br /><br />In regards to the blue tooth; pairing an already paired speaker requires the following:<br /><br />1. Turn the speaker off<br />2. Switch the speaker to \\""R\\""<br />3. Turn on<br />4. Wait for rapid blinking on the blue tooth light<br />5. Turn off<br />6. Switch the speaker to \\""Mono\\""<br />7. Turn on<br />8. Device should be ready to pair with another device.",3,2
"I love the retro style of this case very great looking but it's very flimsy as well! When I put it into my pocket the case tends to slide of very easy! But besides that, nice case!",3,1
"Head shells should be lighter than this for really good tracking of warped records.  That said, for dubbing 78's with an appropriate cartridge, this'll do.  It's a casting, far heavier that it looks.  The graphite fiberglass zippidy do-dah ultralight headshells cost more, and - if you just want to track flat records, this shell is ok.  If you are trying to track warped LP's, shop for a lighter shell.",3,1
The cover looks well-made and fits my Garmin etrex Summit but is does not fit tightly; it wiggles easily and is definitely not water-resistant.,3,1
"I have to pair it every time I use it, and there is a little bit of a delay on voice.",3,1

"Not big enough magnets to create a decent sound.  Very good for vocals, and a lot of treble, but lacking in what little bass it provides.  I put these in a 1990 Wrangler, and with the doors on, it sounds good.  Take them off, hit the highway, and you will be disappointed.  Looking at replacing soon with either the Alpines or Blaupunkt 4X6s.  Bigger magnets mean bigger sound, without getting all technical.  The stock speakers were very heavy, and lasted 24 years.  They sounded much better than these.",3,2
"I recently installed this head unit in my 2013 Suburban. I ordered the plastic tools to help with removing the trim around the radio which helped a great deal since the clips can be difficult to remove, and the plastic trim is not very thick. The harnesses were simple to match up. I did have to make sure that I connected the pink wire for the Back LCD. I also made sure to order the USB 2.0 A Male to Mini-5 Female Adapter to be able to connect the USB from the head unit to the USB harness in the vehicle. I ran the antenna for the GPS to the stock location under the dash panel near the defrost vents. I decided to use the Bluetooth with the head unit since I wanted to have the ability to use the touch screen Bluetooth that is included with the head unit since it gives you more options than the factory Bluetooth. I watched a video on vimeo.com that shows where to place the GPS antenna and Bluetooth microphone, [...]. Following this video makes it easy to install the GPS antenna and Bluetooth cable.Other posts have mentioned that the radio reception is not as good as the factory unit which has also been my experience. My steering wheel controls work, but I did notice that while you can scroll through your radio presets, you can only scroll to the next station when using satellite radio which is annoying. You should be able to use the steering wheel controls to scroll to the next satellite preset just as you can with the radio. I have had a couple of issues in which the satellite radio is not picking up a signal when I am driving the vehicle. Powering off the radio and restarting it has resolved the issue, but this can be annoying as well if you have to wait to power down the unit to use the satellite radio. The navigation works very well. It is very detailed. I like the speed limit and speed indicators as well as the lane details for upcoming exits while traveling on a highway. I also connected the iPod cable and it works very well with both my iPhone and iPod. I had a rear back up camera installed and it connected easily to this unit. The picture is very clear and was much needed since my Suburban did not come from the factory with a back up camera. I used the Back LCD to connect to an overhead monitor that I had installed but found that only the audio/video for the DVD and CDC can be used. I wanted to use the AUX input to send another audio/video signal from a Sirius Backseat TV unit that I had installed, but with this unit it is not possible to do so. I had to find another option to feed the AUX audio/video signal to my overhead monitor since you can't use the Back LCD to do so. The Back LCD also seems to control the volume of the audio that is output from it which is an issue if you are not watching the DVD on the head unit and the children watching the overhead monitor want to control the volume of the audio from their headphones. I have to agree with other users about the delay when turning on the unit and when using the GPS for the first time, but it is tolerable for me. I did find a link from Fly Audio that will allow you to install your vehicle manufacturers logo so that you can see this at start up. I have not done this yet but plan to do so. Here is the link, [...]The issue with the GPS not displaying the time can be resolved by touching the speed indicator on the GPS. If you hit the speed indicator it will also show the speed limit and time. Overall this is a nice unit. It looks factory and retains all of the factory functions which was most important to me.",3,1
"For some reason I am having a hard time figuring out how to load this. I'm sure it can't be that hard, but it's driving me crazy.",3,2
The case is good itself but it is too loose as I put it on my iPod Touch 4th gen. I wouldn't recommend it.,3,2
It hasn't lived up to my expectations.  I purchased it primarily for TV viewing but I find there is a slight delay with the sound when using Sony headphones.  It's even worse when I use external Sony speakers.  I have to cut the TV speakers completely off and then there's a noticeable sync problem with the video and the audio.  I can live with the headphones but it's annoying at best.  I rated it ok since it works when using it with audio only.,3,1
The product description on this page doesn't match the product manual description. It's only 6 hrs battery life and only 1.5w output power.,3,2
"I have had this for 2 months now.  I purchased it to transmit TV audio to my hearing aid bluetooth receiver.  I mounted it just below my TV and I sit approx 9 feet away.  The audio quality is fine, but the signal is so weak as to be &#34;line of sight&#34; at 9 ft away.  That means if I fold my arms, or anything comes between the transmitter and receiver, it loses lock and I get a &#34;stuttering audio&#34; effect until they link up again.  I am going to try and mount the unit above the TV or close to the ceiling to try and expand coverage.  There are also phasing problems with the audio source (TV), but I'm not sure that is the units' problem.  I would have to summarize that its OK for the price.",3,1
Charge does not last long does have a good sound!,3,1
I had to put 3 stars because 1 of the 6 items that I bought were harmed in usb port. but this product its awesome,3,1
Do not complete my expectations!!!,3,1

"My sister got a nook WiFi +3G for her birthday and her favorite color is blue so I though, why not? The case fits well, the bright orange on the inside with a microfiber feel to it is nice. The color is not true to the picture. The blue is more of a green and it looks a bit faded. I would not call any of this leather. It also gets dirty easily was well. I wouldn't buy this again for her because the colors were off but it you don't mind a different color product, this is for you.",3,1
"The cd, dvd and backup camera feature which I had installed worked great. The only issue I had was with the navigational system that wanted to keep taking me to Houston texas and for that reason it received only three stars, so I am now in the process of returning it and hopefully getting one that's working as advertised. It seems that this unit may have been previously own by some in the Houston Texas area for the fact that it keeps trying to take me there.",3,1
"The speaker does have good sound I will give you that. But I tried making the volume higher and I guess it was at the max volume, so it made a noise and then shut off. I haven't been able to turn it back on since. I charged it and everything and it doesn't turn on. But when ever I press the play/pause button the blue light turns on",3,2
It works well - the speed differs slightly from my phone GPS.So who knows which is correct. I have not attached the film onto the windshield yet so I dealing with a bit of a fuzzy look.  It is easy to set up - plug it in and set it in place.  I have it for a utility vehicle so it is not used daily and if it were used daily I might find the fuzzy numbers aggravating but in my case it is fine.,3,1
Nice,3,1
wasn't as good as the last one I had..unfortunately the VCR chewed the other...got a new VCR now...but this one seems thinner????  And makes a lot of noise when cleaning..,3,2
"case is as expected at such a low price. It is very nice, fake leather and the touchpad does fit the case but not perfectly. I wish there was a clasp on the open side of the case to keep the touchpad from shifting, causing the case to cover the camera.

It's not difficult to tune to the right channel but It can pick up other kids' talking once a while.  One odd thing is it will sounds (some kind of signal sound) suddenly which forces you to turn it off.  My kid can talk to her neighbour across the street without any problem.,3,1
"Nice product and it does the job. however, the front is stamped with the word KIWI, which is clearly not visible in the preview photographs.

"Liked this product well enough, but you have to set up the plastic screen protector yourself; I ended up throwing that part away because the sale sticker left gunk on it.",3,2
It worked but was hard to get it to play in the car. The sound was very distorted and not good at all. It was ok but nothing you can use to Jam your tunes with.,3,2
I like it but it is not protective at all I don't reccomend getting it unless u want a unprotcetive case,3,2

So I'm going to have to return them :(",3,2
"The device is ok, but read other reviews for the many features no longer available. This is a Sirius device, not an XM device. Make sure you understand the difference if you already have an XM device. If you have XM and want this radio, you wiil be forced to fork over a couple of hundered extra bucks per year for a new account. The Sirius XM websites says there is a cross-platform discount. There isn't. This is a Sirius device and will require a Sirius account.",3,1

"Video quality is great, for the price.<br /><br />I don't want to spend >$200 for a dashcam, and from the video examples some people uploaded ... this one had great video quality at a great price point.<br /><br />The problems I had with my unit and why I chose to send it back:<br />A) cycle recording failed.  THe card would fill up (16GB class 6) and recording would stop with \\""card full\\""<br />B) recording would randomly stop and randomly pick back up.  3min files are approx 400mb (@720p) File 3 would be 132mb next one would be 82mb and there was 6min of driving missed between the two files. I checked the sdcard to make sure it wasn't trippin out on me, no errors.<br /><br />This particular unit did appear to be used or open-boxed.  There was a plastic, opaque green tab on the 2\\"" LCD display that would not come off.  The unit shipped configured with a foreign language, as expected, but was easily changed over to English.<br /><br />All in all, I was pleased with the product for daytime recording.  Night recording is what you'd expect - hard to distinguish anything.  The LED lights are useless, unless you need access to a decent flashlight quickly.  Unfortunately, my unit appeared to be flawed and proved to be unreliable.",3,2
"It’s both wonderful but not without a few terrible flaws:<br /><br />Pros:<br />• It is elegant looking in a modern car, not bulbous or tacky, it’s a lot smaller than it looks, it’s very tiny, narrower than two finger, thin as an oreo or so.<br />• the forward and back buttons let you go a track forward and back the main button does play/pause and connection/on/off.<br />• The sound quality is very good when it’s working.<br /><br />Cons:<br />• Every time you get in your car you need to press and HOLD the main button for 8+ seconds… this is very very very annoying.<br />• The blue LEDs are gorgeous… BUT THEY DON’T STAY ILLUMINATED. they blink, about once every 7 seconds or so, very faintly and so quickly you can barely see them - the photo is basically a lie, at no time do the lights ever stay lit - it’s a shame - they SHOULD so that you can find the thing in the dark at night.<br />• It BUZZES when not connected, that means that when you get in the car and haven’t re-connected your phone (8-seconds long procedure) it makes high-pitched buzzing sounds through the AUX input, strangely enough even though the device is OFF- pressing the buttons changes the tone of the buzzing, basically it’s electronics have no filtering, and you have to turn the volume down or else it’ll kill your ears.<br />• Pressing and holding &#60; or &#62; does nothing. at all. no fast forward, no rewind.<br />• The main button ONLY does play/pause, there is no Siri/voice activation. Double tapping it invokes REDIAL of the last number called - be very careful with this one, especially with streaming services where you might not be sure it’s playing or buffering so you hit play twice, ‘brrrrringggg’ yeah.<br />• Pressing the track forward/next button causes a strange bluetooth induced ‘skipping’ of the first few seconds of any song/audio, like it’ll cut in about 2 seconds after the beginning of the song, and then jump to about 5 seconds in, it’s very noticeable and only happens when you press it’s buttons (doing next/previous on your phone doesn’t make that happen) this is mostly just oddly annoying but means it’s low quality.<br /><br />The device is so gorgeous and very ergonomic, I hate that it has these flaws, if they were to fix these, it’d be the best. but for now, it’s just ok.s very noticeable and only happens when you press it’s buttons (doing next/previous on your phone doesn’t make that happen) this is mostly just oddly annoying but means it’s low quality.<br /><br />The device is so gorgeous and very ergonomic, I hate that it has these flaws, if they were to fix these, it’d be the best. but for now, it’s just ok.",3,2

Need to improve more looks like this one battery has less time at lest one hours other wise looks good,3,1
The volume on it was bad from the start- I read the reviews and thought I knew what to expect. Bought as a toddler's night night CD player and it fried itself out on the AC cord. Never used it with batteries until it fried- then it worked with it on the radio and that was it. Less than $30 for it- never could get it to work with the USB cord either.,3,2

I like the design and bought it because it was a cheap version of an otter box. but it came with a screen protector but not on the case like an otterbox. it fell from my hands a couple of times and already chipped. buy a real otter box if you want protection for your device,3,1

"First up: I'm a professional Driver (Big Trucks) and drive more in a day than most do in a month and under all conditions (day, night, snow, rain, etc.)<br />Second: I worked for a company that had a good video system on the truck, while I was unsure of this thing at first - after the first civilian attempted to claim that I wrecked them and we played the video to the police --- well lets say I want one in my truck from now on, I can see the day when all trucking companies will do this as most of us drivers (big trucks) are safe and such.<br /><br />NOTE: the manual for this camera is a joke, don't even read it as it will just confuse you.  Just start hitting buttons and  you will figure out more than the manual will tell you.<br /><br />AUTO RECORD MODE: to engage this mode is simple.  1) Do NOT use an external power source, 2) Start the unit in loop recording, 3) Plug the unit into an external power source.

It was a little crooked in the ipod but the screen worked great! and repairing it was pretty easy. Just make sure you dont strip the screws,3,1
The M-Edge cover is Great. The USB cable and Car Charger however will NOT CHARGE my Nook Tablet. Do you have a USB Cable and Car Charger that does work on a Nook Tablet? If so I will send these two items back after I receive the proper items.,3,2
It started out as good player at first. It lasted about 6 months with me until it stopped charging. There was no website for repair information and no way to find the seller for return. Not really worth the buy at all. I'm really mad that I got cheated.,3,2
i bought it to use while i snowboard because i prefer not to have headphones in on the slopes it fits in the inside pocket well and is flat against my body so it dosent hurt much when i crash and burn the case is hard and rugged but the sound isnt that good but oddley enough in my jacket pocket through the jacket it sounds way better.,3,1

"I thought Apple had the touch screen technology down. This iPod touch screen is so unresponsive when playing audiobooks that it is almost unusable. Multiple taps and presses sometimes fail to pause, play or fast forward. Then, for no apparent reason it responds. Or the multiple attempts result in the volume increasing etc. Perhaps I bought a lemon, but with this low level of functionality I avoid using this aspect of the touch screen as much as possible. Interestingly, the touch screen works fine for most other apps and functions. It is marginally better playing music.",3,2
"It seem like a great bargain, but most products didnot work well with my iTouch. The wall chargers actually do more harm to my apple products",3,1
"So there's a couple of things that come- the skin itself (I got black), a screen protector, a belt clip, and an armband.<br />The skin is fine, it fits perfectly, seems durable, and doesn't obstruct any buttons.  The downside is that, WOW, is it linty.  Yikes!  You cannot keep that thing clean, but such is life, and such is the nature of that material.  Silicone skins like this one always end up lint covered, this one just happened to start out that way too.<br />The screen protector I actually think is very good.  It's cheaper than ordering from Creative, and I actually can attest for the fact that it can be removed and reapplied.  See, I ordered the 8 GB Zen originally, but decided it wasn't big enough.  So I ordered the 16 GB and when it came, I took the screen protector off the old Zen (it had been on for a few days) and stuck it right on the new one.  No bubbles, no peeling- I was totally amazed!  I was sure I was going to need a new one, but nope, not necessary.<br />The armband is useless, just forget about it.<br />I cannot get the stupid belt clip to work!!  I'm sure it's just me and I don't care enough to spend a lot of time messing with it, but some instructions would have killed them?  I put the little round plastic thing in the hole but then the clip wouldn't slide on and click in place.  But maybe you'll have more luck.<br />Anyway, I think this skin package is perfectly decent quality for the money, and should work out fine as a basic mp3 cover and screen protector.",3,1
I thought the design was cute. good for boy or girl. bought to protect my sons new ipod nano 7th gen .,3,1
"It arrived on time.  Worked well for a short period of time.  I purchased the product in july 06.  I used it for about 2 to 3 months and then stopped.  I went to use the product again a few weeks ago and the product didn't work anymore.     I wrote the review above in April 2007.  Just in case anyone needs any more information.  It is a cheap products which looks better online than in person.  It is not ugly by any means.  The products holds about 100 songs or so, it is not very user friendly.  If you want something to use occasionaly then this may be a decent starter if you do not have the funds for a better mp3 player.  It is small but there is not a carrier for it and it is not the size or shape of most mp3 players.   If you can do without it until you can save up for an Ipod or another mp3 player then do so.",3,2
I really like tthegarmin  products. The only thing I can say otherwise is that I did not realize it was a refurbished gas but that was probably my error,3,1
"Battery dies a lot quicker than expected, probably only about 2 hours or so. It has to be on while charging it.",3,1
"The device menu and instruction manual are both lacking. It works (or seems to be working) fine, but understanding all the options is very difficult. The instruction manual is NO HELP. It is basically plug & play so it was working right out of the box, which is a good thing. Bad thing is understanding the menu options and what the different available settings actually do.",3,1
good value but you get what you paid for.,3,1
It does not give enough juice to charge my EVO which is what I bought it for. It would be terrific for smaller electronics though.,3,2
This product works ok but it is almost to small and I'm not a big person. It doesn't breathe very well,3,1
"This case is hard to get on/off because of the 2 layer design. The outer silicone layer is fine but has a ton of little holes and flaps that don't seem very streamlined. The inner hard case is a clamshell design and once it is snapped in place it's almost impossible to remove without a sharp object. I've seen better cases out there, but my daughter wanted this one for her iPod Touch, but changed her mind after only 1 week so now stuck with it.",3,2
The eclipse duo is an ok mp3 player but it will not play WMA formatted ebooks. The menue is difficult to read and the lettering is much to small for these old eyes. The music quality is acceptable. It is nice to be able to plug into the usb slot in my car.,3,2
Nothing to rant and rave about. It did the trick for mounting my Hummingbird 560's original sonar transducer.  More moving snap in parts than the original mount that came with the 560 unit had... A bit pricey for what it is and does...,3,1
"I bought these thinking I would need something to protect my Kindle's screen. They came with really easy to follow instructions and are as easy as any other screen protectors to put on. My main complaint (and the reason I removed the screen protector and don't use them anymore) is that they are plastic so they create a glare on your Kindle screen. One of the great things about the Kindle's screen is that there is NO glare even in direct sunlight and I really like that. If you are really concerned about your screen these are great screen protectors and are scratch resistant, but you will be able to see yourself in it at certain angles which I found distracting and took away from the Kindle experience.",3,1
"It was nice and stuff, but when you take photos with flash the whole thing turns green. And in regular pictures it has this yellow thing on the corners, shaping the picture like a circle. I didn't get the stylus so I can't review if it works or not, but I don't mind. Overall I would get it again coz it's cheap. And the buttons and ports worked fine too :)",3,1
"It worked well for a while, but the corners cracked not too long after getting it with normal use. It looks nice though.",3,2
"i bought 2 of these, 1 for my 10, and 1 for my 14 year old.  as far as a ereader, great purchase. i am no techy - the ereader downlowds into a tablet. they can fb, and download a few games with the download and no memory card. if thats all u need its perfect. the wifi doesn't detect connection very well is the 14 yr olds complaint. he has to be in the same room as my modem for signal. they both say its thick and heavy. for $88, its worth the money. it entertains them and serves the prpose. i bought my 18 yr old a sylvania tablet, for double the money and its a better gadget all the way around. my opinion if u r buying this for a young child its durable and easy enough, but your older children will complain its not that great.",3,1
Love the color.  The skin was very nice and has a 'leather' feel to it.  The case is bright and has a nice closure but feels a little cheap.  It will work fine for my tween daughter though.,3,1
okay,3,1
The sound quality and power are better than stock.  Has alot of features but some are a bit quirky.  Pandora does not always work as advertised and many of the pioneer aps available are not compatible with this head unit.  Google maps works well with this and with soften music levels to tell directions through the speakers .,3,1
"I ordered this at the same time that I ordered my 2g iPod Touch 8GB. I love the skin! It fits well and has slots in all the right places. I believe it will give my iPod some nice protection.<br /><br />That said, the wall charger and car charger do not work with the second generation of iPod Touch. I did a little research and found that Apple made a change so that it can no longer be charged with firewire. If you have a first generation iPod Touch, there should be no problem with these chargers. In fact, I'm going to give mine to a friend who owns one.",3,1
I chose this case for my granddaughter's mini iPad.  She is 12 years old and is careful with her things.  However within a few weeks time one of the bear's ears ripped off.  She was very disappointed.,3,1
"This adapter does a pretty good job, so long as you don't need anything charged quickly.  I could charge an iPhone and HTC Desire HD simultaneously, but it took some time.  I've not tried it with an iPad or other tablet, but I imagine it would be less than ideal.<br /><br />The large diameter portion almost limits the use of the product.  It fits fine in my wife's CR-V, but in my 07 VW GTI it is a tight fit.  It fits, but barely.<br /><br />I do like that it has a replaceable fuse and the blue light around the circumference when it's plugged in.",3,1
I really like it and the light is great but it gets super hot when charging (when the light is off).  I don't know if that is normal. My other portable chargers don't get hot. I have yet to see if there will be long term affects.,3,1
"It snaps over your car alarm remote to protect it from the hazards in your pocket and purse. We've had to replace our remotes several times because the back cover snaps broke in my purse and once when dropped. This is an adequate solution, but I believe it would be a little better if it fit more tightly.",3,1
It's very cheaply made. Good for younger kids that break everything. All plastic outer case screen setup is like that of an Ipod.,3,1
"very good product and liable. I tell them to buy this product, comfort and easy to use. tough shell that protect your iPod Touch.",3,1

"I recently purchased the 4.8\\"" GPS Car Rearview Camera System with Deluxe Accessories Kit.  As stated in the title of my review, it could be an awesome product at a great price.  The GPS unit is a slick looking, seemingly well-made and accessorized device.  The camera, by appearance is impressive as well.  Unfortunately, I have yet to get the camera to transfer a picture to the GPS/monitor.  To further complicate things, Since the electronics I have purchased in the past have all worked as advertised, I didn't test the system immediately after receiving it, which a practice I will make a point of doing in the future. Because I assumed it all worked, I really didn't have the time to get to it until after the 30 day warranty period had expired, which was about 3 days ago.  I have not contacted the seller about replacing the seemingly defective camera.  I will do so in the next few days, and hopefully, the issue may be solved over the phone, or the company will replace the camera if necessary.  The documentation is minimal at best, which is not usually a problem when devices work without the need for troubleshooting or replacement.  I will submit (if I am allowed to do so) a follow up review on the customer service experience. I will state if the issue is solved, and the satisfaction I have or do not have with the company's customer service department.  I really think the system could or will be a great value.  That outcome, however, will now be the sole responsibility of customer service.  I am betting they will make me a happy customer who will follow up with a like review.",3,1
"My first impression on this mini car dvr camera was its light weight. It is very light, maybe because it is built with most of the plastic. It has an internal 600mAh battery. It works on my first power up. After I inserted a sd card and start recording fine. The video quality is pretty good. It records in HD 1280x720 with 30fps/S and sounds; Loop cycled Recording could choose 2min/5min/10min; it also records in continue mode. More, it comes with motion detection and Infrared Recording. It also feature a screen protector or screen saver. It could takes snapshot still photo in 5M. It said it could support SD/MMC card up to 64GB. I only tried it with a 8gb sd and it works fine. It has a USB 2.0 interface. It does recording automatically after the car power up and power off after the car shut off. This car dvr also feature a slideshow on photo playback mode. It also comes with an usb cable where you could charge the unit on the pc and the unit could use as a flash drive or use as a Webcam. But I haven't tried the Webcam since I do not have a webcam app in my pc. The only thing is when I tried to charge the unit with the usb cable on the pc, if I turn off the unit while it still charging, then the unit will stay off unless I reset it. In order to solve this problem, I turned off the auto power off feature and make sure to unpluged the usb cable before power off the unit. All in all, at this bargaining low price with so many features on this unit; it is a decent mini Car Dvr.",3,1
Snaps on easy enough. Like the  look and thinness.<br /><br />Only gripes I have are it tends to get dust trapped under the case. I have to remove the case about every week or so to remove the dust\dirt.<br /><br />The case is already fairly scuffed and scratched. I've only had it about 4 weeks.,3,1
"I like the arm strap but the strap is too big. It doesn't fit very snug on my arm so it keeps slipping down to my elbow when I walk or run... It would be nice if the strap was adjustable but I guess, for the price, it's a great deal for men with big biceps or women with thick arms.",3,1
This is a tight fit so don't expect to be able to remove it easily when battery replacement or recharding is needed but it serves the purpose of protecting the two way radios.,3,1
I ran a pair of these subs in a sealed box wired to 2 ohms at 95 watts rms per coil and the outer coil blew in less than 1hr of play time. While they worked they sounded great.,3,1

"When I first found this FM Transmitter, I should of known it was too good to be true. If you want a good Transmitter like this you need to pay more than 50 bucks. This model feels cheap and the sound quality is not that great no matter what station your on. Turning it on is sometimes a hassle, most of the time I dont bother turning it on because I dont feel like trying to out wit a Transmitter. For the price you can only expect so much from it I guess soo dont expect a great sound quality or for it not to break in half-in a week.",3,2

"Now I wish I looked at the other reviews more carefully, and would have realized they were fake reviews that were artificially improving the rating, which now looks pretty obvious once you examine the reviewers' history.  Anyway, This case does indeed fit the next generation Nexus 7 2013.  It is kept securely inside with the outer perimeter have fixed (stitched) flanges. Adequate coverage distance is given so that if you put any edge of the case on a surface, the tablet itself will not make contact with the surface.  The inside keeps the tablet from slipping out with a velcro flap, which is very secure. Two magnetic nubs keeps the cover shut when not in use. I wish they didn't put the name of the case on the front; it looks tacky, but fortunately doesn't stand out.<br /><br />I bought the sapphire blue version, and has a textured leathery feel to it. There was also a very strong chemical smell to it, which I assume will fade in about a week; it didn't help that they sealed it in plastic wrapping.  I wish the inside had a smoother felt feel to it. The JKase I bought for my paperwhite had a better felt smoother.<br /><br />The strap used for holding the tablet works, but doesn't feel comfortable for several reasons.  One is the strap is too narrow, about 3/4 inch. In contrast, the case for the paperwhite I bought had a strap of 2.75 inches so it was much more secure.  Additionally, there is no padding on the back of the strap, just the flexible/stretchy elastic canvas (the same material you commonly find in the waist of your pants).  Interestingly enough, they put leather padding on the outside, which looks nice to the person across from you looking at your case, but doesn't do anything to protect the back of your hand.  There's also no secondary strap, so that when you're using the strap, it will cause the tablet to sag due the weight of the tablet.<br /><br />There are appropriate slots/holes for the usb ports, rear camera, and power/volume buttons,speakers, headphone jack, etc.  Generous room is given for the power/volume buttons, so accessing it shouldn't be a problem.<br /><br />It does come with a combo pen/touchscreen rubber tip pen.  Although I won't be using it, it's a nice touch.  Unfortunately, this also means that there's a useless pen holder now.  The pen writes smoothly, but you have to take it out when you're using it; it will interfere with accessing the volume buttons. I also worry that the person using the pen might confuse which end is which, and then use the inky hard tip against the glass.<br /><br />Closing the cover does put the kindle to sleep, but it takes a while (30 seconds or so) for it to wake up from sleep when you open and lift the cover; probably an issue with the device and not the case.<br /><br />Using the rear lip/flange allows you to view the tablet at 135 degree angle or 60 degree angle.<br /><br />The box did come with a warning that it will not work with wireless charging, but that probably applies for all cases.  If I want to be very picky, I noticed about a 3/4\\"" of thread that was too long, but still sealed/pressed into the case, possibly when they were dyeing it.<br /><br />Now I wish I waited until more cases came out instead of getting the first thing that was available, but it wasn't too bad of a choice.  It gets the job done if you're in a hurry to get some protection for your case and has all the basic features (has the lip so you can view at different angles, magnetic closure).  Shipping was a bit faster than expected, took 6 days when earliest DHL said it would arrive would be 7 days.",3,2
"Gin Rummy is one of my favorite card games.  A few days ago, after getting tired of the online games that are on the Internet, I started a search for an application that I could run locally on my computer.  This turned out to be a not-so-easy task.  When you do a search for gin rummy software, there are a lot of sites that offer \\""free\\"" software.  I recommend being very careful about which \\""free\\"" sites you click on.  Anything listed as free on the Internet has a good chance of having some nasty stuff inside.<br /><br />I finally settled on this program because I just didn't like the other ones I'd tried.  Many of them have interfaces that don't look good and many lack flexibility to be able to play the game as though you were using an actual deck of cards.<br /><br />I found this program on the Bicycle cards web site.  You can purchase it and download it from the web site.  One downside is the software is not shareware.  You either have to buy it or you don't get to try it.  Once the program is loaded, be prepared for the application to do some weird things to your monitor.  Like so many graphic-based games, this one doesn't run well on the high resolution Windows desktop right out of the box.  If you have a display like mine, which is 1680 x 1050, go to the program settings and run the application from a window.  By doing this, the program won't change your screen resolution.<br /><br />When you get the program going, the graphics are quite good.  In fact the cards look like real cards and the animation is quite impressive.  The game makes you choose which cards to put in your melds.  If you don't properly lay down your melds, the game will count the cards as deadwood.  It takes a little bit to figure out how to lay down the cards.  Watching the tutorial was helpful.<br /><br />There are a few things I don't like about this application.  Even though you can supposedly enter your own name as the human player, during actual game play, you are always Damien.  I've gone back to the settings section and it still has the name I entered, but in the game, I am Damien.  There are only two ways that the program will let you arrange cards, by rank or by suit.  You cannot group melds together in your hand unless they end up being together under the 2 sorting schemes.  So you have to really pay attention to the cards.  On more than one occasion, I've discarded a card I didn't mean to because the card wasn't grouped in the meld.  The game does not allow going \\""Big Gin.\\""  You must discard when going out, so big gin isn't possible.  And my final complaint is that the program requires you to completely close the application after a match.  Then you have to restart the program to continue play.<br /><br />When this program is compared with the others that are out there, it's not bad.  If you want to play Gin Rummy locally on your computer, this is the best there is.  Just remember that it isn't anywhere near 5 stars.ll has the name I entered, but in the game, I am Damien.

The goose neck holder is a little awkward because if the vehicle has a deep recessed cigarette lighter, this may not work well for you.     If your iPhone is in a case, this makes for a very tight squeeze. So it doesn't make sense pulling your iPhone in and out of a custom case.     The iPhone plug in came apart after a few weeks.

"Cord too short for me... and I do not have a very large car.    For me, the cord was way too short to reach from a power adapter on the dashboard to a the windscreen where one would normally mount a GPS. The cord length states 3 feet in the product description, but that I guess that is the 'uncoiled' (stretched out) length. At that extreem uncoiled length that you need to have the cord, it places way too much side-load tension on the 'power in' port on the GPS and I fear will at some point break the power port. The tension is so taunt that it sometime pulls the GPS suction mount off the windscreen.    That said, it did power up my GPS. If this cord lenght can work for you, then it is a low cost charger replacement. I sent mine back due tothe cord length issue, so I cannot comment on long term durability other than it did power up and operate my Magellan GPS.    Jim",3,2
"Alright so I got the pack of all three for my new iPod and don't get me wrong they work for what there made for... But... The Case doesn't really look like it could withstand very much.

"I checked the reviews on this camera and it seemed pretty good, received it super fast and got it working within a half hour but like the other reviewers said the manual isn't to much help. Picture is real good but the only gripe I have is it only runs on the built in battery and only lasts like an hour so you continually have to recharge it every time you want to use it and that gets to be a pain. You can put a USB plug and charge it in the car lighter socket after every use. It needs to be working every time you drive or its useless because you never know when mayhem is going to strike. If your serious about this next step in security like I am you might want to spend a little more and get one that's a set it and forget it until you need it.This one is set it and recharge it. Just my 2 cents on it.",3,2
"My teammates and I used several of these headsets for a Chump Car enduro race at Road Atlanta this past December.  We were able to hook them up to a Motorola radio and had in-car communication with our team in the pits. We had no problems hearing the pits with these earpieces - very good volume and the sound quality was pretty good.  However, I'm thinking the mic isn't good quality as we had difficulty in hearing the driver when they were on track.  We kept the windscreens on the mics and had these placed in full face helmets, but it seemed like there was a lot of background noise transmitted by these headsets to pits.  If they have problems with our in-car environment, I'm not sure how they can be any better in the more open motorcycle environment.  Couldn't complain based on the price of them, though.",3,1

"The Hybrid Kickstand works fine and the black outer cover works great for screen protection.  Also, if you're interested in clipping the device to your clothing or bag, the clip function on the black outer cover works.  Here's what I would change:  the rubberized casing kickstand only allows for horizontal placement of the device.  The device cannot stand vertically while in the casing.  The black outer casing also has a kickstand -- that kickstand is a nice one that would allow both horizontal and vertical placement.  Unfortunately, the device only fits into the black outer casing with the screen covered.  The device, with or without the casing, does not fit screen side out in the black outer cover.  Because I don't carry my device around too often, the black outer cover is pretty useless.",3,1

"I use another transmitter that isn't wireless that has a clear sound, but I wanted one that would charge my iPod while I listened.  I found this one, and the design/aesthetics are excellent and it had what I was looking for.  The charger plugs into the bottom of the transmitter while the transmitter plugs into the bottom of the iPod and also has a simple couple button remote.  Well this one does charge the iPod, and does so well, but it sacrifices the sound.  No matter what channel I put it on, or settings that I changed, I always heard static - and not just a little buzz, but a consistent scratchy noise that increased with the volume.

You can't adjust the volume with the iaudio 9 loaded.  The holder is only big enough for the iaudio 9 without the plastic case.,3,2
Not impressed: I was looking for a slim light weight protective tablet cover and the 8.9 size was difficult to find.  I guess it meets the description but the design is chintzy.  The front cover has a crease or hing for when using as a stand.  I haven't used it as a stand yet the cover does not lay flat when closed like a book.  The inside of the cover that closes against the tablet screen does not have a soft finish.  So now to get picky.  The picture dosn' t show it but there is a P7300 in a gray oval in the center of the cover!  I guess it is the product serial code but why spoil the cover?  I have seen much nicer tablet covers for the i pad and book readers; hopefully they will become available for the 8.9 tablet.  (Side note: I love size of the 8.9 tablet!),3,2
"the sound quality is excellent, BUT once the blue tooth is disconnected, the speakers turn off.  So every time you'll need to turn them back on and re-connect to the iPhone.  To me this is really annoying.",3,1
"It certainly is pretty loud for the compact size, comes with a nice little pouch for the speaker.  My only wish is that it should have a volume switch so it's easier to control the volume on the device itself, rather than on the phone.  Not sure why they didn't bother doing that.",3,1
"This works well but the instructions are vague at best.  It comes from China and some intallation intructions were missed in the translation.  Hopefully you have some analytical abilities but I figured it out after a few failed attempts.<br /><br />Over all, it pumped my 0 - 1 bar up to a solid 4 bars for T-Mobile",3,1
"The product does protect the device very well. The feel of the material is very nice and allows your finger to glide quite effortlessly over it. However there is quite a bit of friction felt between the figure and the film with sliding your finger around it. The film also gives off a \\""rainbow\\"" effect under certain angles and light which is also noticeable when you are using the device. But the price for the product is very nice and the company delivers in a timely manner. Processed my order on a sunday and shipped it to me in two days(USA). As for protection AND clarity you'd be better off looking for another screen protector.",3,1
Works ok. Little of a challenge to learn how to operate it. Very brief instructions included. Only charges using USB.,3,1
But i have yet to install this unit on my truck cant give a good rating now. maybe later this summer.,3,1
Printed circuit board is of poor quality and was improperly labeled and spaced for the components.  I had difficulty soldering components to the board.  The solder that was included in the kit is the lead free variety and was absolutely terrible for soldering the components to the board.  The capacitors were of decent quality but the tolerance could be better. I finally used 60/40 kester solder with copious amount of rosin flux.  The switches were of good quality and the embossing on the case was ok.,3,2
"I purchased this product with the two add-on solar panels, bringing the total number of panels to four (inclusive of the one on the main unit). Unfortunately, the panel connector part arrived broken (seems to be a common problem). I was able to use a twist-tie to \\""fix\\"" it, so I thought I'd give it a shot. I followed instructions and let the unit charge via USB power prior to first use (I did this several times even though the manual said to do it once--as I saw comments here before I ordered saying that it's better to charge/discharge via USB 4 to 6 times prior to placing in the sun). Using this method, I was able to fully charge my HTC One smartphone twice on this charge level. So far so good.<br /><br />With the unit drained after 5 charges/discharge cycles on USB power, I then tried charging it in the sun. I have a large, sunny backyard so I thought this would work well. However, even after a full day in the sun WITH the add-on solar panels, I couldn't get the unit above 50% charge. I thought it might be a fluke so I left it out all day in direct sun the following day. Still the unit wouldn't charge above 50%. Finally at the end of the third day it showed 3/4 full, so I decided to see what I could get out of it. To my disappointment, I was only able to get my HTC One charged 75% of the way before the unit showed no power. This doesn't make sense since I was able to get two full charges by USB with 4 bars showing, whereas I only got 3/4s of a charge with 3 bars showing.<br /><br />Worse, after a few more days the charge capacity grew less and less--I wasn't even able to get it above 50% under any length of time in the sun. I thought I could still live with it but then the unit's flashlight began turning on by itself. I'm now no longer able to turn the flashlight off, so whatever power I'm receiving is immediately being wasted. Time for a return.<br /><br />Hopefully I'll have a good return experience. If so, I'll append this review.<br /><br />----Update----<br /><br />The seller, Accessory Genie, shipped a replacement panel connector part for free. That did the trick. Apparently the poor charging issues and the inability to turn off the main unit's flashlight were all connected to the damaged panel connector. While I appreciate their honest and excellent customer service, I still don't feel that the product deserves more than 3 stars since it is very fragile and doesn't charge anywhere near as rapidly as promised. However, it is adequate for its purpose and if used carefully it may yet prove to be a fair source of backup power to charge one's phone or ipod when no other power is available.",3,2
"Bluetooth doesn't work all the time , seems like I'm re syncing it every day to the same item",3,2

"I basically loved this case from the minute I saw it and I loved it just as much when it came in the mail. I ordered this case at the same time that I ordered my Kindle. The sad thing was that it didn't fit. I didn't realize that there was such a difference in the sizing of the different Kindles. I have a regular Kindle and this case is made for the Kindle with the keyboard. I will say that the only problem I had with the case (and this isn't a major problem) was that the map on it is upside down. That makes it look a little strange but other than that it is an great little case, just wish I could have had the chance to use it.",3,1
I bought this product even after reading all of the bad reviews about it. I am glad I did. It is the only mount I found that I liked for mounting my GPS unit on my motorcycle.It did need a lot of modifying to make it hold the GPS unit well. Now it works fine.,3,1
Sound isn't that great,3,1
"The good thing is that it can play music downloads from Amazon and very easy to put songs on it<br />pros:<br />1. Good screen size<br />2. You can easily play files once organized<br />3. It can play movies<br />4. Build quality feels good<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Touch screen is resistive(though it includes a stylus)<br />2. poor quality music playback even using good earphones<br />3. has a speaker though not loud enough<br />4. No fm radio(not every one cares about fm radio)<br />5. Poor battery life<br />6. Lacks Bluetooth(many MP3 players do)<br />7. Not responsive at times you have to press hard.<br /><br />Oks:<br />1. Camera(but low quality)<br />2. It accepts only videos in avi format<br /><br />Bottom line: I would recommend this MP3 player if you don't mind the cons listed and just need a low cost MP3 media player. Otherwise look for better quality such as iPod nano or iPod touch, or another well known brand such as Sony Walkman, Samsung, or sandisk.",3,1
$18 for a stick on picture about 1.5 inches each way is too much but if your daughter is obsessed with JB what can you do.,3,1

"This works fine. Stays on while running, iPhone 4 fits in it well, but if you see something while running you want to stop and take a photo of, other than taking it off your arm you also have to take the phone out. That happens more than I thought it would.",3,1
not bad,3,2
Fit was Ok but a little hard to install and creases easy but over all I believe it will do the job.,3,1
Easy on and easy off.  My 6 year old loves it.  It is 2 inches longer than the iPod so you need to take it off in order for it to charge. I would not recommend this if you are buying a case to protect your iPod.,3,1
The product is decent and does a fair job but the translation doesn't seem to work the best that it could.,3,1
It's a good watch because it tells you stuff like the date  but I got a white one and certain parts start to fade and look blackish gray,3,1
"Really great product.  My kids love having their music in the shower.  However, battery life only last for one showering.  A real pain to have to take off the wall & charge between showerings.",3,1
A bit confusing while installing the software. Works well with OBD2 vehicles. I attempted to use it with an adaptor for an OBD1 Camry and couldn't get it to work.,3,1
These Screen Protectors are a mid priced protector and you get what you pay for!<br />They are fairly easy to apply and reasonably clear!<br />They have not been as rugged as more higher price protectors I have used!<br />Since it is a multi pack they can be replaced when needed!<br />Thay work as promised and a good budget/mid priced Screen Protector!<br />I would buy them again if they were all I could afford!,3,1
no booklet on how to use it and i can find one online. there doesn't seem to be a random song function. but other than it seems ok.,3,2
The product at times has to be reset.  I have had for several weeks now and had to reset GPS.  I have also attempted to update maps but had had no luck with steps provided! I give this product just a very average rating.,3,2
"I wish this product was a bit steadier.  The hard inner shell popped out the first day I got it.  It also doesnt fit in the grooves properly so it doesn't sit up very well. I will likely get a different on soon, this is not likely to last much longer.",3,2
"This is a great \\""extension cord\\"" for my iPad, the only problem is the part that plugs into the iPad does not click in or stay pluged in. You have to plug it in and not move much, other wise it comes out. The reason I purchased it was to have the oppurtunity to use the iPad while it was charging. I was surprised That it was labeled as apple approved, and it does not stay tight when you plug it in.",3,2
Worked great for 3 months but then just quit right in the middle of a song. Won't charge up or recongnized by the computer.,3,2
"The bass is horrible compared to a Bose, but it's good to have while camping.",3,1
You try out the PowerSupport USA one....I like these protectors a lot actually....I purchased 2 other much cheaper protectors that had a lot of fingerprints/smudging.  Just like the previous review mentioned that these look really great until you start using your phone then they get prints all over them.  I went down to the Powersupport store in Burbank and purchased their crystal shields (they also have really great anti-glare ones) and let me just tell you it's like night and day...yes the power support ones cost 2 for $20 and are not as cheap as these but the quality is at another level...of course they will get prints/smudges too but not for awhile or unless your hands are moist...the material is very durable too....another thing is on these protectors the smudges/prints arent super easy to wipe out...on the powersupport ones the smudges come right off.  I like these for the money and as a temporary solution...however if you are looking for something more long term than I would recommend the power support ones,3,1
"Why settle for less, when you can get a brand new original iPod Video 60GB for Free! I got mine from this web site:  ilikethis.info/ipod-video",3,1
nice color but my Nook was too small for this case.,3,1
"This install took me almost 3 hours. Ok, perhaps I was being overly careful because I didn't want to break my son's iPod touch any further (I was the one who dropped it off the kitchen counter... sigh). After the install I notice a smearing of the image toward the top and bottom of the vertical screen when pressing--the LCD smears into a broad halo that disappears in a couple of seconds. Otherwise it functions fine. I am getting him a stronger case with some rubber corners so this doesn't happen again... and to wrap around the edges of the bezel a bit to help hold the new screen in place. The instructions I used (below) used both the supplied tape (almost all of it) and a bit of super glue. I opted out of the super glue and just used tape.    The blue color is perfect for my son-- really electric blue.--his favorite. I did notice that the screen is a bit harder to keep clean though. There is either a residue still on it from the manufacturing process or it's simply a cheaper grade of glass. Oh... and before I finished the install and removed the protecting plastic from the digitizer (the silver part on the underside) I noticed some scuffs that I couldn't blow off. Not sure if this will effect performance in the long run. Again, cheap Chinese replacement parts.    Here's a link of the install instructions I followed. It was very comprehensive--perhaps making me slow down so I was sure not to make a costly mistake.    [...]",3,1
The visor is fine. I just wish it would have come with English instruction.<br />The game was a hit. It made my 12 year old smile.,3,1
The product was as stated. It was easy to apply. The problem was that one of the sheets did not peel away on one side. This could have been a manufacturing flaw. Since I needed only one sheet I did not return for credit.,3,2

Simply a decorative cover. Doesn't provide much cushion or protection if the iPod is dropped.  Cables/cords don't fit perfectly with the case but it is manageable. :),3,1
I needed to obtain a separate power chord as it did not work of the USB connection.,3,2
"I got this for my Motorcycle, it looks cool, however Please make sure you read it correctly.  The pic shows 2 lights, but its only for one. Make sure you get the correct amount,  I thought I was getting a pair but only got one. Now I have to wait to get the matching set another week.",3,2
"Because it has a clip on the back, the new Nano doesn't really lend itself to to being fully covered like the old Nano did, but it still needs some protection around the screen, as the screen protrudes a bit from the body of the iPod.  This covers the edges of the screen and is just thick enough to keep the screen from being the first thing that hits the ground when you inevitably drop your Nano, and because it's rubberized, you're less likely to drop it in the first place.  It's hard to tell from the photos, but the case has just a bit of a \\""lip\\"" at the top and bottom that hold the cover in place and give a bit of protection to the buttons without getting in the way of using them.  Unfortunately, this lip has the side-effect of making some headphone jacks impossible to plug in, but the Apple ones fit just fine.  The fit of the cover on the Nano is otherwise perfect.  It's snug and will not slide or come off accidentally, but it's also not hard to remove if you want to.  I got the black for my silver Nano, but this cover also comes in a bunch of colors.  Highly recommended, particularly at the price and free shipping.  Edit to add:  Removing two stars for the durability of the rubberized material.  Some of it rubbed off just from the friction of being in my pocket for a few days.  It still does the intended job of protecting the unit quite well, but it doesn't look all that great anymore.",3,1
These cables are not very long. I wanted them to organize a charging station but they are too short for the I pad in the station.,3,2
The screen protectors are not as easy to put on as shown. It is a good thing that it came in a two pack because the first one had to be thrown away.,3,1
"Plugged it in, didnt work.  That is to say, any wire worked just as well, and that is not enough.  I live just outside a metropolitan area where radio signals are strong and plentiful.  The oem antenna on my car is poor relative to my others, this is unusable.  Maybe there was a break in the wire somewhere?",3,2
"The reader looks really good, but once you begin to use it many of its flaws become apparent.      The internal processor is slower than what I expected.  The touch screen is responsive, but it does reflect quite a bit of light.  I always find myself adjusting the reading angle to reduce glare and reflection.   There is an optional stylus to use on the screen and I prefer to use that because the screen really shows finger prints and smudges.     Another issue is the font sizes for ebooks.  While my ebooks are free downloads, the font is very small.  There is a zoom feature to enlarge the font, but I don't like this because not all the page fits within the viewing area.  I have to \\""turn the page\\"" 3 or 4 times to complete one page of an ebook.      The biggest issue is the software which comes with the reader.  It is very slow and must be installed on your computer to access sony's online books.    I would like to see a drag-and-drop feature which  would make adding documents to the reader much easier.  Instead, I have to go through a long process of searching and finding which documents to add and then use the program to add the documents to my library.  In other words, the software that must be used with the reader is not user friendly.    There are optional ports for extra storage and that is a plus.  I have added music and pictures to an SD card.  The rest of my documents are on the readers internal storage.    My honest opinion: Go for a Kindle or Nook instead of this.",3,1

on the pic it kinda shows a glare over the screen and i was hoping there was a clear plastic that covered it but it doesnt. the only vulnerable and most important part of the device is left wide open. i ended up just throwing saran wrap around it then puttin the case on. why isnt there a simple case with a screen cover for these things?,3,2
heavy and works.  gets warm.  Don't bother signing up for new trents free product testing that is just a way for them to send you nonsense emails.,3,1
Not as bright as I expected. Pretty much just as bright as the original old style 42 mm glas blubs I wanted to replace. The only plus for me is the color is good.,3,1
No instructions included,3,1
"This is a beautiful and sleek case but not good for protecting, or standing up to every day wear.  When dropped the red chipped off and when I put it in a tight black case the black rubbed off on it and I couldn't clean it off.",3,1
"Thought it was going a to be a bigger case, can't put original car charger in with it, too small.",3,2
"this appears to be a good item, but you need to have some basic electronic assembly skills in order to assemble it. plus you need to purchase a project box or find some way of protecting it from damage after installation. the instructions that come with the unit are hidden in the hanger card that seals the package so don't rip the package open, and again you must have some basic knowledge of electrical components and a good set of eyes or strong magnifying lens.",3,1
"It was really good at the start, but after a few weeks of use some rhinestones began to fall off.<br />I would not recommend this to others.",3,2
"i really like this cover, its so awesome and cute, the only thing is that the little cover for the screen that comes with it attracks dust really easy and it never slides on without stuff underneath.. i know its not too easy to fix considering its sticky.. but yeah thats just what im reviewing.. other wise cute!",3,1
"The vendor shipped promptly.  The product was as described and did solve the battery issue on my phone.  However, I is a very difficult installation process.  Cracked the screen in the process so was no better off.  Would not try this again.",3,2

The camera only lasts about 20 minutes on a charge.  The only way to really use it in the car is to plug it in.,3,2
"This is a great product for what it is meant to do, prevent liquid damage to your Kindle. The problem is that you have to open it to hibernate the Kindle, and you have to completly remove the device to charge it. My only other complaint was that it was not assembled evenly. The part of the cover where the fabric meets the plastic screen that covers the front is not strait. I don't know if they are all that way, or if mine is unique.",3,1
It blocks the remote control function on it because of the overlapping case. No fix for it rather than buying a new case or cutting away the material blocking it.,3,2
This case is nice looking and fits well but the two halves come apart easily.  Every time I put the charging cable in the bottom it pushes the IPOD up which separates the case.  I'll probably put something sticky in the junction to hold it together until I find something better.  Shield for face is difficult to apply without getting lots of bubbles.,3,1
"Purchased this case for my new Verizon Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7; build quality is good - this case is well made, and nice and thin, but not quite perfect. The tablet snaps into a plastic backing that has nice rounded corners and edges, which makes it nice to hold. However, those rounded corners prevent this case from allowing you to prop the tablet up at the two viewing angles the cases allow - the rounded corners keep slipping  the edges on the case. Also, the case allows the tablet to be rotated to prop the tablet up in portrait orientation, but the rounded edges on the plastic backing don't allow the tablet to stay on that position either.<br /><br />Didn't see many other options, so I will stick with this case, but not really pleased that it won't stay propped up.",3,1
plastic tab at the bottom broke. Otherwise it is ok for what I wanted it for and works as stated.,3,1
Works well,3,1
"I had to give it three stars, because I think the idea of this is excellent. I lament the fact that the pieces started to fall apart immediately. I was really looking forward to going to work with them. With some redesign (make it easier to use) and better materials I would buy it again. I loved the idea of this product, I just wish it were better.<br />Very hard to tune the radio, operate the mp3 selections and work the volume. To the manufacturer: Please improve this, I think it would be worth it.",3,2
"Nice interface, easy to use.<br /><br />One thing is that I had to reset it a couple of times in the middle of a long trip. Basically, I was stuck until I went inside a gas station asking for a needle. I would recommend buying a smaller, but more reliable one from another known brand. That will also get you the advantage of getting the latest maps.<br /><br />UPDATE :<br />What I would do is pull over at the nearest gas station and beg for a needle. This is exactly what happened on one long trip from Massachusetts to Virginia. I lost the signal halfway there and just went on the main road I was going on and I was hoping to stop somewhere at my destination to get a needle or get a fix. And that's what I did. Luckily I had some paper directions just in case. The second time, a similar thing happened in New York and I used the same needle. Buy this and a needle altogether if you want.",3,2
"Pros: <br />- Good build quality <br /> <br />Cons: <br />- Display is to bright, even when dimmed. <br />- Alarm volume is way too loud at the minimum setting.

That turned out to be wishful thinking on my part.<br /><br />The product will certainly allow you to import tapes,  but it will do it at real-time speed. I found that to ensure a good recording I would need to monitor the recording software as well, so the process ends up requiring a bit more effort than you might expect.<br /><br />Overall the product is functional, but it feels pretty cheap and limited.",3,1

"We used the Garmin Dog Tracker on the deer hunt in Ontario( we can legally hunt deer with hounds) the first week of November. The terrain is open hardwoods and rolling hills. The longest tracking we got was just under one mile (1.46 kms) which is a far cry from the product claims. I can't see this product working during the summer months with full leaf coverage. We also have a lot of cedar swamps which would cut GPS transmission at any time.  On the positive side the unit does work in it's limited range.

I thought this was going to work out great.  I also bought the extenders so I could charge phone/iPad without removing protective covers every time.  But unfortunately it didn't work that way.  When I put the iPad on the extension adapter it was so heavy it started falling.  Us inning the adapter for the iPhone with its case on proved similar.  So it did not do what I wanted.  It will work great if you don't use protective covers on phone or iPad.  I wanted the convenience of charging with covers on.,3,2

I have to keep the plug partially plugged in at the perfect angle, so that it will play correctly.  The speaker didn't cost enough to bother with sending it back....I just ordered a new one of better quality and higher price.  As they say, you get what you pay for.",3,1
"This MP3 player did not hold a charge for very long and died completely after a few months.  For the price, I guess I got my money's worth.",3,2
"ok, but doesnt fit too well.<br />Used for a bit, but found it to be more of a hassle than needed.",3,2
This charger is good for a person who is travelling and does not need to lug on a laptop for charging via USB....otherwise the time taken for charging the Archos is roughly 4-5 hrs similar to the USB charging....so there is no addded benifit for fast and quick charging with this charger.,3,1
Not much of Bass Sound at all. Volume range is mediocre. Made of poor quality materials. Bad choice of purchase.,3,2
"The charger works pretty well, but the fm transmitter kinda sucks.  The transmitter works better with the Ipod function on the Iphone, but is really bad (fades in and out, scratchy) with Pandora.",3,1
"I had a smaller FM transmitter before, it use to produce lot a static noise. I think this product fairly does the job, have used it for few days now. cradle could have been little longer so it doesnt hit when changing gear.    Main problem is I have Navigon installed on the iPhone 4, its doesn;t work when placed on the cradle. works just fine when I take it off. I think the FM transmitter is causing some interference.     Does anyone experienced similar ?? are there any good product in the market which has Cradle, FM tranmitter, charger and still work map applications. ??",3,2
under par for Boss,3,1
"I have installed the bypass per included instructions.  For the first minute or so after starting the car, and intermittently thereafter, the head unit acts as though there is no bypass.  In other words, the head unit is supposed to sense if the parking brake is on, and make certain functions active or unavailable accordingly.  For example, the phone dialer on the head unit will alternate ON/grayed out every half second or so.  After the first minute or so of the car being on, it seems to mostly work properly, so I am still happy with the purchase- it's better than nothing- but it hasn't worked as smoothly as hoped.",3,1
Little bit cheaper but work alright.,3,1
I had a problem with getting the complete product.  Vendor was able to supply clips I was looking for.  I still think the product I received had been opened.<br /><br />I also have been having trouble getting music in the correct format.  I will get there though.  Have not been able to use it yet.  :-(,3,1

Pretty delicate.but work if u need cheap battery case.,3,1
The Treo leather cover is of nice material but I find the cover to rap around the key board too close and makes it difficult to press the keys that are close to the sides of the cover.  The Vaja phone cover is far superior but it also cost a lot more.  The Vaja cover protects the phone well and the leather around the key board comes up flush with with base of the keys; this allows for easier access to the keys around the perimeter.,3,1
"HELLO ...  I Really liked this NAXA Player for Several Months, until it started Acting-up !<br />  Everything seemed to be Working - GOOD ~  Until I Cycled thru a span of songs/albums, and then a Problem arose ....<br /> &#34;There was a Lack of  *POSITIVE RESPONSE* ~  It Would NOT Cycle with any Certainty//Repeat-ability!!&#34;<br /><br />  Thanks/Regards,  JCN.",3,2

"This is a great product for a charge, but unfortunately the actual plug in wire backed out on me only a couple weeks in. I  would recommend getting a quality fire wire for your Zune device.",3,1
"The digitizer is pretty much what you would expect, but the plastic tools are sub par.  They broke during installation and I had to use my own.  Not a huge deal as the item is pretty inexpensive.",3,1
It was shipped great and very fast.. it doesnt work really that well it has to be on the side closest to the antenna of the truck for the radio to pick it up with out any white noise...,3,1
"Can't complain too much because it was a great price, but it definitely is not Apple fit and finish.<br />Apple tends to give really cheap wires to begin with so I am impressed that this wire is a heavier duty wire than the apple wire. However, the lightning plug does not fit into the phone the way my apple charger does. This one rather requires some force to push in, and even more force to pull out. Whereas the apple charger tends to click in and out, this one does not have that same effect.<br />All in all, I would buy again as it is really cheap, and long, but the quality of the lightning plug is barely up to par.",3,1
"had a couple of the 12 that I bought that didn't work that well. One of the selector buttons on one broke almost immediately. For $10 they are pretty good, though.",3,1
Don't laugh but my friend just got his deck installed in her car and couldn't figure out how to detach the face...car audio is my second language and even I'm stumped!  I don't want someone breaking in cuz she left her faceplate in! Help!,3,1
I have not checked everything on this device seems to be ok however the earphone DO NOT WORK! Good thing I had extras laying around the house or I would have thought the device didn't work at all. I even attempted to plug them up on the computer and still didn't work. The earphones are trash and if you buy this be sure to buy another earphones somewhere else.,3,2
"I love this cover with one exception. When I try to use it as it is pictured - \\""standing up\\"" for viewing, the transformer is too heavy for the case and it falls backward. If I really work at bending and holding the cover back it will eventually work . . . until I close the cover for a while. Then I have to shape it all over again.  Other than that it's great - wonderful color, good feel, and I feel like my transformer is adequately protected.",3,1
worth the 5 dollars i suppose.  would not purchase again.  Took over 2 weeks to arrive at my house.,3,2
"I bought this as a gift for my sister. I wanted to set everything up so when she opens her present, she can use it right away. The screen is sometimes hard to detect a touch. My computer wouldn't recognize it when I plugged it in (I have windows 7)what's up with that? Also make sure you upgrade it, how you can do that without encountering problems. I don't know, because I still can't get it to upgrade. Other than that, I can't complain too much because one, it isn't mine, and two, this is what you get for $84 bucks.",3,1
"The cable and block don't look anything like the original chargers, not that I was expecting it but just so you know.   It charges my iPhone 4, but it is absolutely impossible to use it while charging because the phone just turns unresponsive when plugged.   I also try to use the block to charge an ipod and it didn't work.",3,2
"[Used it for two days; Ordered on 06/14, delivered on 06/22] <br /> <br />First of all late delivery (8 calendar days, even after $7.x of shipping), other items I ordered arrived 3 days earlier than this one.  Not sure if it's Fedex or the seller.   <br /> <br /> <br />Bad thing: <br />Poor quality earphones (silver in color, where as the player is black). Not enough length to keep in pocket.  You have to wear it around your neck with the player hanging at the other end.  Sound is fine with my Altec Lansing headphones, but it's my computer headphone with mic.  Bought a Sony ear-headphone for some $13 and now it's all set.  Be prepared to buy one. <br /> <br />Player body fine - not very attractive; big compared to memory sticks, but decent if you compare it to say Sandisk's mp3 player; the cap doesn't look very secured to the player, but haven't faced any trouble with it so far.  You have to remove the cap in order to change the battery.   You have to first slide out the cap and then slide out the battery cover if you need to change the battery.   <br /> <br /> <br />Good thing: <br />Plays FM fine.  Did an auto scan of channels, and it detected 11 channels (missed a few).  Can easily switch between channels, can tune channel manually, and can set a manually tuned channel to one of the 11 presets.  Haven't tried the FM recording feature yet.  I'm not sure if I'm going to use FM much anyway. <br /> <br />The software is well designed and makes good use of the limited hardware available. <br />The controls are well placed and convenient to use. <br />The user manual is sufficiently documented. <br />Is quite cheap. <br /> <br /> <br />Finally: <br />For 50$ I guess this is a good value for money.  But I'll suggest spend some more dollars and go for a known brand like Sony, Philips, Creative if not the ultimate iPod!  On the least, you won't need to buy a new headphone ;)",3,2
"For the price it's okay. I like the color and it's padded, but it feels cheap. The binding is flimsy.",3,1
These caps are for 36 psi use.  The 36 psi rating is not shown on the Amazon product description.  Regretfully I needed caps for 50 psi.,3,2
Yes,3,1
"The protectors are fine, just a little big.  Better than being too small.  A little trimming and there fine.",3,1
"Great product.  It works great for my daugher who uses it all the time.  The one before this one broke, so be careful that you have a cover as they are not that durable.",3,1
"It was great - fits good.  It was a very light baby pink instead of a hot pink.  the picture posted is hot pink, it is misleading",3,1
"The car charger works with my husband's phone too.  It really does charge a lot quicker than any other generic one and it's sturdier than the original charger.  It doesn't connect right all the time and makes the electronics turn on and not charge so I can't use it.  The case is the same as the one I had before.  The magnet was detached from the inside and didn't close anymore.  We'll see how long this one lasts.  I imagine any stylus for nook is the same.  It doesn't have as much sensitivity or precision as my finger and the tip is almost as big as my pinky. The headphones didn't work right.  I have to plug in only the tip or you can't hear the sound of voices, just music.  I thought I was getting a good deal, but overall, the quality makes this package very expensive.",3,1
"I have an iPhone 5, which they do not currently make a FM transmitter for which is why I bought this one that plugs into the headphone jack. There are two problems, one is that it is not wireless. It has to be plugged into your cigarette lighter in order to work and the cord is short so when plugged in my phone does not reach the mount. The second is that the wires fit loosely when plugged in and if they are not in tight enough you hear a lot of static. I wish I payed less then $11.",3,2
"I have used this MP3 player everywhere, riding the bike, jogging, at the gym, taking it on trips and still works.  Sound quality depends on the MP3 music recording format. I got iPod and the Sansa delivers crisper higher volume music using the same type of MP3 songs.  The only thing you should know is that every now and then they tend to freeze, and I mean that they will appear to be dead and do not respond. It is a simple fix, just push the button toward the Power side (UP) for more than 30 seconds and it will reset itself. You know what, my Apple iPod has crashed a few times and even the internal HD died having to send to warranty. The iPod cost me $225.00 through Apple store and still crahes, so these things do happen no matter you go high end or low budget.  The Sansa is very unique when choosing memory cards, so try not to go cheap buying EBay knock-off brands, and expect to work. Although it states that it can handle any memory size, that is not true. The most it can handle is around 16 GB. Did try 32 gb and it froze or will not respond after a while. The Sansa is more stable because there are no moving parts compared to the iPod that uses a HD. The good thing about Sansa you can have multiple cards with different songs, conferences, audio books and its as simple as removing one card and adding another. With a iPod you have to plug it to the comp, transfer files, etc, its a pain, too much work for me.  Movies, at least for me, did work but the sound in combo with the movies was off by fractions of a second. I really dont mind, for the price is a super deal. Bought another one as a spare with different song cards depending on the mood. What I like about Sansa is it has radio, and that is a plus.  The software that comes with it is optional, songs can be drag and drop on the fly with Windows. That is the good thing about Sansa, no need like iPods to use the stupid iTunes etc.   The batteries last a long time, one can be easily listening to music for two days before it starts to go low on batt.   Do recommend the Sansa, good quality, great price and a one year warranty from the manufacturer.",3,1
"My dad ordered one of these for his iPad because the speakers didn't get as loud as he would like.  He got these thinking it was going to be a great improvement.  He plugged them in and couldn't even tell the difference between the loudness of the internal iPad speakers and the Boombug.  Needless to say, he is sending it back.  I felt the need to post this review because of the 5 star glowing reviews posted previously.<br /><br />UPDATE: We were able to get more sound to come out of it by a bit of tweaking.  It's still not super loud, but it is louder than the ipad speakers.  Not too bad for the price that was paid, but not still not outstanding.",3,2
"Nothing tremendous to said here ...it's a csae for your Zune HD . Shop it around , I purchased one for a friend at $11 and then one for myself at $4 . They were exactly the same by the same manufacturer , down to the packaging .",3,2

I've swam laps with this MP3 about 10 times. The instructions are vague but I was able to get music on it easily. One side of the head phones clonked out. I'm considering weather to get better headphones or exchange this one for another. I'm disapointed with the headphones but the rest of it works well.,3,1
"It states it works for an Iphone, but this is untrue. My does not fit in this case. It is made for an HTC",3,2
"Works fine. Snaps on and off easily.  The way they are shipped is not good.  I my case only one arrived broken, which is pretty good under the circumstances.  They can fit a 4mm cable wrapped so it passes through twice.",3,1

"This case gives good protection to the back of an iPod touch, but gives no protection whatsoever to the front face of the device. Had I realized that, I would probably not have ordered it. Luckily, I also purchased some film to protect the front glass against damage. If you buy this case be sure to do that!    The \\""free\\"" wrist strap is useless. There's no place on the case, or on the iPod itself where it can be attached.",3,2
Looks good but was hoping for better quality sound. Too much treble sounding. The oontz should learn how to be &#34;all about that bass&#34;,3,2

"This stereo was way to $$$$ expensive. However, I was desperate to find a stereo system to listen to my old audio tapes. I looked in stores, and was only able to find boom boxes. I don't necessarily want to transfer my tapes to CD's - just listen to them.    The stereo works, although the sound quality is not great. Granted, my tapes are old (15+ years) have not been stored securely or cleaned as needed. The stereo manual mentions these issues to explain any degraded sound quality. Also, the manual mentions a problem with listening to tapes over 90 minutes (most of my tapes are 110 minutes).    I had a Sony stereo similar to this one 20 years ago, until the tape player stopped working. It was heavy, looked nice and good quality. This stereo is very light, making it feel cheap and plasticy, but it looks pretty good and fits nicely in a small area.     So far, so good. Will update later.",3,1

Well it makes the Kobo look pretty but that's it.  I thought it would protect the reader if it was dropped like the rubber one I have for my Kobo Touch but it doesnot.,3,1
the sound quality is good but the battery life isn't so good. last about 30 minutes. good for short time periods.,3,1
"I really like the tower itself.  It puts out a great sound.  My reduced rating is due to the fact that this was a new product and the adapter for whatever device you wanted to use in it (iphone, ipod, etc) was missing.  When I called them asking for them to send me the missing adaptors, they said I would have to box it all back up and return it (at my expense).  This thing is BIG.  When asked what they do with the returned product, they said they destroy them!  OK, not only am I missing parts from what I paid for, but I feel they lied to me too.",3,2
"This was a very nice case for my iPod Nano 7G.  Not high end, but not high priced, either.  The cover protected the iPod very well.

Then a small piece of the hard plastic for the clip broke.",3,1
"I bought the 2-pack of 3ft cables, one in white and one in black. The white one did not support my Iphone 5 and when I tried to charge my Ipad Air on both my computer and with a wall charger, it kept flickering the charge on and off, which I consider pretty useless. Luckily the black one charged. Paying $17 for the pair, I would have been better off buying a better brand for one cable, or trying my luck with a 3 or 4 pack for cheaper (I did the latter..I like to take chances :p)",3,2

we bought this item for my daughter for Christmas and promptly returned it when we discovered that buying books for it was near impossible.  Sony books are more than 50% more expensive and many of the books she wanted for it were unavailable    Love the touch screen.  It was the reason we originally bought it.  The need to connect to computer frustrating.  It should be wireless for this price!,3,1

My daughter was really dissapointed.",3,2
"I loved the price of these bundled products and that's what got my attention.  I was looking for a variety of Zune accessories and the description fit the bill.  I received the items and was mostly happy.  I really wanted a better set of ear plugs for my player, but the ones included in this kit work intermittently at best.  A slight movement of the wire and the sound was lost.  I liked the rubber case (although not the black color), the arm band and the chargers.  I was sharing a charger with my husband and it was not convenient.  I also liked the \\""rope\\"" that attaches to the rubber case so I could carry it around my neck.  This is good for bicycle riding and beach trips.",3,1
"The actual Nano is fine and good value for money.However, the headphones at time do not produce clear sound.",3,1
I really liked it because of the fm radio and the fact that it was rechargeable. I bought this product for my iPad but the cable didn't fit.  The company contacted me to resolve the issue and I have to say that they are very conscience of making sure that their customers are satisfied with their purchase.  I would purchase from them again.,3,1
"I'm using this RH951S Diamond Antenna (144/430/1200MHz & Wide Band Receiving Coverage) on my Baofeng UV-5R+ Plus. The RH951S is about 14\\"" long with a center load. The antenna has some flexibility and it seats properly on my Baofeng.<br /><br />Sorry, reception and transmitting is about the same compared to the factory rubber duck antenna.

Beats the heck out of an FM transmitter though because you can hide the iPod and control it via the steering wheel.",3,1

"theres defiantly some limitations and the interface looks like they slapped it together in a day. the sd card slot and usb port do not work, ive tried all different formats and cant get it to play. its an alright basic unit but the card slot was one of the main reasons i bought this.",3,2
"After about a year the battery goes and you basically have to toss it in the garbage because of the high cost of a new battery. This player has very few features other than the bare minimum. You cannot slow down or speed up audiobooks, record voice and a bunch of other options that would be nice like an SD slot. Do yourself a favor and save 50% and buy a Sansa Clip 4gb for 40$. The sansa has every feature you would want in a player and is built very robust, I have bought 3 of them so that if they are no longer made, I will have a steady supply.",3,2
"To start, this in NOT an Apple product as implied, but surely no one expects anything from Apple for $30.  The unit seems to do what it's supposed to do, but there are no instructions whatsoever.  The ad implies that the unit shows time, and it does- just the time elapsed since it was plugged in, as far as I can tell.  I don't see any way to set the time, only the tuning.  But you didn't want another clock, did you?  It also references remote.  No idea what this means, but rest assured there is no remote control.  Maybe they're talking about the fact that it's a transmitter and can maybe be picked up a few feet away. Tuning is a pain since all you can do is scroll up and down but then you don't have to tune that often anyway.  Don't be misled by the \\""two dimensional tuning\\"" verbiage.  All that means is that as you hold the button longer it scrolls faster.    All in all it gives acceptable service and is a good value.  No big downside that I can see.  Just don't think that you're anything more than a basic cradle transmitter.",3,2
The case protects the iPod touch. However it tends to slip off and the thin rubber on the bottom front buy the menu button moves and is really flimsy. It works okay but I will eventually have to buy something else because I can tell it is just a matter of time the flimsy piece will fall off.,3,1
"I obtained an iPod Touch through a friend, coming with just a worn out cable (which I separately ordered). I decided to get this since I already knew I'd be using it in the car a lot and since I needed a few other things so I could share it with my husband on trips. It came with everything described (please note there are only 10 items technically listed but it comes with 2 silicone dock adapters). The case is very thin and doesn't seem too durable but it's good for if you need immediate protection. The plug adapter works as well as the car charger. Headphones are very cheap but the sound is ok, which is all I expected. The headphone split adapter works as well as the aux cable. The stylus pen doesn't do so well on the iPod so fingers are better. I got a screen protector with the other case I ordered so I didn't use the one provided in here but it does seem to fit the iPod and looks simple to  put on. The dock adapters were really the only thing I didn't need. Overall, starting out, it's a good accessory kit for the price and if you need most of it, but for the most part there could be better ones out there. This suited me for what I needed.",3,1
"Bought my daughter an IPod for her birthday. She picked out this car charger but was really having problems with how her IPod fit in it and was afraid it would break something. Also, had trouble getting the remote to work. She no longer uses this charger.",3,2
"I am not sure why everyone raves about this case - except that it does fit the Nook snugly and the pattern is interesting.  When it came out of the package it smelled strongly like burnt plastic.  The fabric was not as vibrant as I expected, almost washed out or grainy.  I agree with a reviewer of another color who stated that it looks like a bad attempt at silk-screening.  The cover is not a tight fit and the magnet is weak.  There is a loop and space to hold a pen.  If you do not place a pen inside, there is extra room and this causes the top flap to overlap the cover in an unattractive manner.     I am still considering returning this item, but the initial smell is fading (after 5 days).  There are some positive features.  It holds the nook securely in place. This cover feels good in my hands.  Unlike some covers that are stiff like a board, this one has a nice amount of padding.  The inside materials and stitching are nice.      Overall, I do not think the product is worth the price (as of 1/14/2010).  It is nice at a glance, but not great upon inspection.    However, the JavoEdge company provides to notch customer service.  Fast shipping and response on returns.  I had my return authorization number in just a few hours.",3,1

"Maybe I'm just not *there* yet in terms of audiophilia but fifteen bucks for a LOD is more than I'd like to pay, except I already paid it. :/ Anyway, it does offer an an improvement over using the headphone out, most notably it gave my higher impedance phones a LOT more volume when paired with my E5, and a bit better SQ. If I had to buy it again, I might pass on this because after 2 weeks I can already see some strain where the cable connects to the dock and jack, which I don't think would be as big a problem with the longer cable on the L3. I guess time will tell but I took off one star because already I'm not confident this will last for long.",3,2

I originally gave this item just a 1 based on what I felt was excessive charges for shipping and handling. I admitted in the review that I shared the fault by not being more attentive when I ordered. I am pleased to say that the company contacted me promptly and apologized for the misconception and refunded the shipping charge. This shows a company that cares for its clients.,3,1

I bought the filter just in case at same time as the dashcam, expecting to be able to use it in case of glare, but not realizing that the nighttime image was significantly affected.  Nothing wrong with the filter itself.  My windshield was typically, with some tinting imbedded in the windshield. I suspect most other drivers would have the same complaint relative to the dark dashcam image at night, and will remove the filter.",3,2
This case arrived a little big for the 2nd generation Ipod Touch.  It does not fit close on the sides but rather catches and pulls on many things because it is loose.  It is not a good fit for pocket use.,3,2
My IPod fits well in the case and I like the magnet closure for a more secure feel.  I do wish it had a belt clip on it or a strap so I could hook it to the waist of my jeans.  However...it's not a super-high quality purchase.  The thin strips that hold the face of the unit in are uneven and curled.  I will keep it only because I love red and it wouldn't make sense to spend the postage to return it.  Maybe I'll try to add photos later to show you what I mean!,3,1
"this replacement screen and digitizer is perfect, for an ipod touch 3rd generation. that's very important because once you've destroyed your original screen and attempted to put on the clip for the digitizer, you'll find that the clips are incompatible. further, in the teardown of the OEM screen, i learned that the ripping off of the broken glass that there's a very important housing that the home button goes into that doesn't come with this screen. in addition, this screen doesn't come with adhesive to fix the glass to the old housing. so if you're to put it onto the old housing, the glass would just fall out. keep that in mind when buying and attempting to teardown the old ipod and repair it with this screen.",3,1
"This fits very well and I like the color a lot, but it picks up lint and other debris very easily, it never feels clean.",3,1
This product was okay; but after two weeks (after replacement) it cracked in the top left corner.  Not sure why!,3,2
"I loved this media player until the day it stopped working.  It's small and can play most common formats.  It's pretty easy to use.  However, right about a few weeks after 90 days, it suddenly stopped playing.  The blue LED light kept flashing and it was very warm (some would say hot) to the touch.  I thought it overheated so I unplugged it for a day.  However, once I plugged in again, there was no respond, not even the LED light.  It continued work, however, as an external hard drive when plugged with the USB cable to the computer.  Anyhow, the company told me to send $15.50 with the Micca Slim to have it repaired.  I am still waiting for it.  Just a warning to potential buyer out there.<br /><br />+++++++++ UPDATE ++++++++++++<br /><br />I received it back with updated firmware and new AC adapter.  I was told that it was the faulty AC adapter that caused the failure.  I do love this media player.  I would have given it 5 stars if I didn't have run to problem so soon.  I understand that every gadget has a failure rate and they did fix it quickly (at a price.) I hope the fix with last.  I don't know how common is this issue.  However, I think potential buyers should be aware of the failure rate.",3,2
Some of the mat were not cut exactly for the space wihile other were cut perfectly. This made the mats look cheap.,3,1
This product is sturdy and will fit in glove box of smaller cars.  I wish there was enough space for the additional adapters.,3,1
"As a buyer of well-over 300 Baofeng radios (and counting) for the group I belong to (not all of which were purchased through Amazon but many were), I'm always amazed at the lengths some sellers go to to hype their products as being \\""newer\\"" or \\""better\\"" than other models, or perhaps (to give them the benefit of the doubt) they just don't know any better.<br /><br />First, the Baofeng UV-5R series (including the original and still extremely popular UV-5R, I'll explain why in a minute) is what is normally referred to by many as a SDR radio (or software defined radio).  While not a true SDR product (you can't use it with your computer to control the radio's functions or scan a wide amount of VHF/UHF frequencies with it), none the less a large chip is programmed on the circuit board built inside each radio.  That chip determines what capability the radio itself can perform.<br /><br />Every UV-5R series radio has the ability to transmit from 136-174 MHz on VHF and from 400-520 MHz on UHF in both narrow-band and wide-band modes (very useful for the occasional FRS or MURS use, which requires narrow-band mode to work correctly).<br /><br />Every model does \\""at least\\"" 4W on VHF/UHF from the factory, but occasionally you'll get a batch that does 4.5W or even 5W out, but the difference between 4W and 5W is minimal at best.  A 4W radio with a better antenna will easily outperform a 5W radio with the standard crappy antenna that Baofeng ships on ALL (including the UV-5RA, -5RAX, and -5RAX+) models.<br /><br />Baofeng DOES NOT program those chips any differently for the UV-5R vs. any other UV-5R series (including the UV-5RA).  Version 307 of the firmware (which is the most current release I have in any of my radios) works EXACTLY the same way as previous older releases of firmware at least back to the 295 release (over a year ago), so any claim from a seller that this release provides additional features (at least from a user's perspective) is simply BOGUS, since the firmware inside both radios have the same features.  In fact, my UV-5R radios with the 307 firmware release is EXACTLY the same radio (inside and within the firmware) as my UV-5RA radios with the 307 firmware release.<br /><br />Second, you CANNOT in any way upgrade the firmware (unless you count buying a different radio and it comes with a different firmware release), so again the claim in the listing from some sellers that you can is simply BOGUS.<br /><br />Third, you can believe that two thinner pieces (glued or screwed together on the faceplate of the UV-5RA) is somehow stronger than one thicker piece of plastic (on the original UV-5R series) if you like (and maybe it is), but I haven't seen that in real-world use from my own UV-5RA units.  The standard UV-5R units that we use seem to hold up just as well (when dropped in the desert dirt or rolling down a hill) as any other Baofeng radio we own and use.<br /><br />Fourth, and my biggest issue with all of the non-standard UV-5RA, UV-5RAX and UV-5RAX+ units, is that NONE of the Baofeng battery accessories (except the little 1800 mAh standard battery) work WITHOUT modification (unless you use a Dremel tool to grind or cut off part of your extended battery that works on the standard UV-5R - but won't work on your UV-5RA, UV-5RAX or UV-5RAX+).<br /><br />Getting new UV-5RA units that don't work with Extended 3800 mAh batteries (without modification) doesn't make my group happy.  That may not bother you, but NONE of the sellers of the non-standard UV-5RA, UV-5RAX, and UV-5RAX+ units ever seem to mention that lack of hardware compatibility in their listings, so buyer beware!<br /><br />BTW, NONE of the \\""AA\\"" or \\""AAA\\"" battery shell packs work on the UV-5RA, UV-5RAX, or UV-5RAX+ units either, so that's 3 different battery accessories (including the 3800 mAh extended battery) that you can't use on these radios without hacking them with a Dremel tool (but they all work without modification on the original UV-5R units).<br /><br />So \\""if\\"" you want a \\""pretty\\"" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (or -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.  Oh, you should see how well that shiny faceplate lights up when a flashlight hits it in the dark, just the thing you don't want for night use.<br /><br />Virtually every guy in our group ends up carrying a standard UV-5R and giving the UV-5RA, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ to the wife or kids, since the wife and/or kids rarely care about the other accessories working and they (the wife and kids) tend to like the \\""pretty\\"" radios, but again there is NO INTERNAL difference and NO EXTRA FEATURES in the UV-5RA, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ units (other than a different looking shiny faceplate) vs. the original and still wildly popular UV-5R (which I refer to as the M16 of radios, as all the accessories you match it up with just plain work).<br /><br />Now you know the real background on these radios.f\\"" you want a \\""pretty\\"" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (or -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.

I love the way it fits the case and the choice of light levels....however I've had mine for less than a year and it will no longer hold any position!  The tiny plastic stops have worn almost totally off.  Not for someone who uses it frequently.,3,1
This armband is a no-frills kind of armband. It isn't anything more than you would expect but it delivers what it says it will. The armband comfortably and snugly fits an iPod Nano and allows you to be active without the hassle of wires going in every direction when keeping the Nano in your pocket. Lightweight and non-annoying. Good buy.,3,1
"I wasn't expecting much because the price of this sleeve was so cheap, but I mean come on!  It still wasn't the cheapest one on Amazon, so it kind of disappointed me because I received kind of a faulty one (the bottom part is like not melded together, has like an overlapping part and a slight cut that is definitely going to rip in the near future.  It doesn't stay on too well when you're taking out of your pocket but overall it keeps my new ipod touch pretty clean and dent/scratch-free.      I got the yellow one and the pattern looks really cool!  doesn't look cheap EXCEPT for the giant soon-to-be rip.  Also, the button at the top doesn't click as easily anymore probably cause they didn't make the material in that area thick enough.  Same goes for the volume buttons.",3,2
"The speaker worked fine when I tried it out for the first time but after a week or so it developed static and I am not sure as to why this happened. My daughter loves the purple color and the flashy lights but I don't think that this is a product I would recommend. The controls are hard to operate and I did not like the box it came in was flimsy and not protective of the speaker. If it was not for the other products in the bag then this product would have been damaged easily. This is a good starter Bluetooth set for a child because this is all FLASH and not worth the price, should be cheaper. I bought another Bluetooth speaker and it sounds marvelous but from a more established company and I have no complaints about it so you can take a chance on this speaker and the results may be different. Good luck.",3,2
"This clock/radio is &#34;okay&#34;.  I fully expected it not to stay lit up blue... because I had read the reviews.  HOWEVER... I did NOT realize that the numbers on the clock aren't even lit up.  You can't see the time unless you have a light on in the room, or if you press a button to turn on the backlight on the clock.  Very disappointed in that.  Even with a light on in the room... it is a struggle to see the time unless you're near the clock - because the regular display is a dark tint to begin with.  The radio works nicely.",3,2

Love the color and design but there are no magnets in the cover and so there is no smart cover at all.  I am sure it isn't needed but was used to it with my other cover and since they advertise that it has it in the description you would think it would be there.  not disappointed in the rest of the cover though.,3,2

"8/06/2013  The radio cycles thru a sand clock timer, logo, loses the time, and get the time back from the internet pretty much on a daily basis when I turn it on. The process takes like 3 minutes. Then it works fine until the next day. Seems like it is updating software but I find it odd that it does it so often. It has actually done it twice while listening to music. Very strange. Also the \\""on\\"" button would not work on the device while it is throwing a fit, only the could be turned on by the remote. There is something wrong with the software of the radio. I noticed the new radios dropped $40 in price form $300 to $260. There is a reason for it.<br /><br />7/12/2013 I got my refurbished radio today. It came more wrapped than if you were mailing a dozen of eggs. It was actually annoying having to open 3 boxes (this is the Russian Doll of radios), peel plastic wrap, pull a foam cover... Turned on, connected to wifi, programming is straight forward but the touchscreen is not very sensitive. It's one of those cheap mooshy resistive touchscreens. The remote is ok but the radio is on the slower side responding to commands. Time comes automatically from the internet. Radio reception is less than average with the stock antenna. Internet radio was ok but had a lot of buffering pauses making it close to useless. It might be better with wired internet but I doubt it since it is sitting next to the wireless N router. Pandora sounded great, no pauses there. The Bluetooth function was easy to set up with a Galaxy 4 phone and works fine up to 15-20 feet. I haven't tried the ipod dock yet, so I'll have to update later. It already had a glitch where it stopped responding to the remote, lost the time, and cycled through the logo for about a minute. I'll keep an eye on this. As for sound quality it is ok, just ok. FYI, I'm not an audiophile but I'm not deaf either. They describe it like every radio in the world: \\""fills the room\\"". What is that supposed to mean? That phrase is tossed around so much that it is already meaningless to me. You cannot find a review without that stupid phrase. It's just a peppy small radio in the end, and it sounds like such.  You are not going to throw a big party with it. As for the remote, it is small and will probably get lost easily. I programmed my Harmony universal remote but took like an hour. Every single key had to be taught about 100 times because the Harmony had a hard time recognizing the commands. Very annoying indeed.<br /><br />Overall, I paid 200 plus shipping for it and it has more features than any other that I looked at for about half the price. That's its main selling point. Bluetooth will probably be the most used, even to stream Pandora (or Spotify) because if you sit away form the radio you cannot see the screen and change the station. If it fails I'm screwed since it cannot be returned (refurbished) and the warranty is only for 90 days. I guess I'll get an overpriced Bose with the Bluetooth adapter and consider it as a very expensive radio lesson. I'll update in a few weeks/months but keep in mind no news is good news.",3,2
The headphones in themselves are great.  The cord is not long enough.  I have to hover over my radio orTV to use them.  A the computer they are ok because you have to be next to it.,3,1
"took awhile to recieve my product but of course I ordered around christmas so shipping was a little longer, was just as pic shows, white with 2 inserts, I have not really used it yet, but put it in my car and am happy it fits nicely in my glove box so I have it when I do need it.........",3,1
"Not familiar with dash cams, but reading many reviews, I am finding that there is a huge difference between various dash cams - some do not have a screen for a user to immediately view what has been recorded, others seem bulky like this huge black thing hanging from your windshield. I have learned that with \\""computer stuff\\"" I have to read the directions several times before I can grasp that pressing this does that, and clicking that does this, otherwise, I am great at confusing myself and messing everything up!<br /><br />As mentioned, some dash cams do not come with a view screen so, the first thing you'll need to do is download the viewer from Lukas website ( http://www.lukashd.com/gnuboard4/bbs/board.php?bo_table=eng_viewer ) which enables you to change settings in the camera. I have both a P C and a Mac Book Pro - I downloaded the viewer to my Mac Book. This can be done without first, buying the camera. What you need to do is open the viewer in what ever computer you'll use, insert the SDXC memory card and change settings, and save them. Changes you made through the viewer are saved as a \\""config.\\"" file on the memory card. You cannot see the results of your changes until you go out, run your camera until you're finished and re-insert the SDXC card back into your computer for viewing. OR, you can buy a small 12 volt view screen for your car, connect it to the camera and work through it.<br /><br />My dash cam came with a 16 GB SDXC memory card, but you can increase the card size to 128 GB. You must use either the dash cam or the Lukas viewer to format the card and make the changes, telling the camera it is working with a different sized memory card.<br /><br />A great feature of this camera is its tolerance to high temperature or low temperature. A dash cam in the southwestern states can get pretty hot.<br /><br />Another great feature is the low lux. This camera works in lower levels of light.<br /><br />The camera has GPS which acts like a trigger, it tracks when your moving or stopped, and likewise, it changes recording modes. There is a setting that allows you to change how long you're parked before the camera changes from moving to being parked which changes the camera to sensitivity (sudden motion) mode in case someone hits your car.<br /><br />The rear face digital display on the camera shows your speed as you're driving down the road. I discovered my speedometer was a couple miles an hour faster than I was actually going.it changes recording modes.

Good fit for the Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 but they forget this Tablet comes with a infrared thing to be use with any device you have at home and this cover this part on the Tablet.

I finally found a tutorial for another product, but the library worked and the pins all matched.  The tutorial I used was on Ladyada's site.  Search under ds1307rtc.

"Ive applied screen protectors to many products - this one was a tad bit more difficult. Otherwise as advertised.

I would look at a cheaper offering.",3,1
"This skin is alright. The good is that it is quite thick, the adhesive seems good and the print is of a good quality.<br /><br />If you look at the picture, it does to its credit show that the peice for the back will not cover the whole back and that is fine. The problem however is that the front peice also does not cover the front completely like it shows here. There is a little bit of white that shows around all the edges. Also, my particular one had a defect in the factory cutout for the eInk screen. Because it was not completely cut out, when I peeled it out, it took some of the clear overcoat off causing a tear. Now there is a bit of the clear coating that is loose and can be unsightly.<br /><br />Overall, it's not bad but you can't really expect them to redesign the front part considering they don't sell the 1st gen nook anymore.",3,2

Can't really go wrong with the price - if you need a short cable.  I use this with a portable battery to charge my iPhone in my pocket.  Works well and doesn't take a lot of room.<br /><br />I had one already fail after a week of use.  I am on my second one and have been using it for about 2 weeks.

Trimming the foam inserts in the case helped, but not enough.",3,2
My radio worked great but it just died after 2 years.  Not worth the price for such a short life.,3,2
"I like the screen of the ipod touch and the ability to scan and see more than other mp3 players. i am used to it and it is fairly easy to navigate your msusic. It has a good number of problems though. I haven't figured out how to organize the apps, it gives random messages of its inability to do things, and the wifi connectivity is inconsistent. 8GBs does not hold much.     The iessentials stuff is all knockoff garbage. the retractable headphones simply do not retract at all and the little bits of plastic on the earphones come off in your ear. The other stuff is basically useless and has similar knockoff issues.",3,2
"streaming doesn't work as well as I expected, but backup camera works flawlessly.",3,1
The charger arrived w/in the time set by the shipper but it took the entire time. Seems to work well enough. I did notice some of the tiny writing on the plug says that it's a product of Abble. So I'll probably continue to  use my charger that actually is an Apple product and save this one for when I'm in a pinch.,3,1
It's awesome. I use it all the time while doing yard work and it keeps everything outta the way!! I would highly recommend getting one of these if you do yard work or exercise,3,1
"I can just get it around my arm (15 inch bicep relaxed),  otherwise appears to be a good product.  Construction is of good quality.",3,1
"Works great so far, but it's cheap plastic and I'm not sure if it will last more than a few months.  I use it with a Monster cable that doesn't fit into my iPhone with case",3,1
The screen is not very bright and the on/off swich does not always work properly. The camera end is small enough for my needs and the L.E.D. light on the tip is very bright.,3,2
This is a very well constructed case; however it is too small for all of the accessories that come with the GPS. Which it was a little larger.,3,1
Good,3,1
"I paid a little over $10 for this transmitter for my old work truck. And, for that purpose, it works well. It actually locks in the radio signal better than more expensive models that I've used. But, the sound quality is compressed and makes the high end frequencies crackle and distort. It is very compact and easy to use. Again, for $10, you can't complain too much.",3,1
"does the job so cant complain overall,so if you want real reviews check out the eevblog teardown of this same charger",3,1
"This is an ok product, especially for the low price. However, it is very complicated to the find files, menus, etc. that you are looking for. Basically you either have to spend 30 minutes trying to navigate your way through the complicated menus, or scroll through lists of hundreds of songs to find what you want. I would most likely spend an extra few dollars to get a better player.",3,2
This case is ok it dosent match with black but it does with white which I have. I've dropped a few times and no marks. But on the back the silicon part does with the hole and dots on the back.,3,1
ok,3,1
hing broke off soon afterwards,3,2
"The speaker was surprisingly good the first time or two we played it.  But after that, it sounded like it lost some clarity / crispness.  It is very cute, but nothing special.",3,1
"Easy to setup and intuative however, the level of volume is somewhat less then say, while using your radio (AM or FM) and CD player.",3,1
"This product is good,  but I was going to return it becuase it did not fit my ipod.  I just sent the product back",3,2
"This little guy is surprisingly loud and bassy for its 2ich size.<br />Does not have the greatest sound but for the price it is decent.<br />Does not come with any chords or anything.<br />The white middle part is silver not white.<br /><br />Would have rated better if they would not have come shipped badly scratched, however the company is sending me 4 new ones for free. Speedy response.",3,2
"decent quality, not keen on its swivel but i can deal with it. but it was well put together. I think my issue is mostly i should have got one with out a swivel",3,1
Power cord failed in a couple of days. Camera works fine.,3,1
"This is an amazing speaker for what it is. That is a speaker that is smaller than a can of Coke, that doesn't need wires, and can play from any device that has A2DP Bluetooth or a 3.5 mm headphone jack. However, don't let the excellent reviews of its sound make you think that this will sound like a large speaker. It is still a tiny form factor and while it sound is big for it's size, it is still small.<br /><br />The worst thing for me is that it is very difficult to choose the source, that is Bluetooth or the headphone jack. You have to press in and hold a button for unspecified period of time then let go and hope sound comes out of the speaker, repeat as necessary until you find your source. I don't know why they did not just put a sliding switch to choose between Bluetooth and the headphone jack.<br /><br />Additionally, it loses its Bluetooth connection quite easily. I have had no problems with the Bluetooth pairing, but the connection drops.<br /><br />Also, in mine if I am playing it and charging it at the same time, it will stop playing after some short (5-20min) arbitrary period of time. The device continues to play the song, but no music comes out of the speaker. Between the charging and the Bluetooth problems, the only way that I have gotten it to play for over an hour without any issues is to connect with the headphone jack cable and not charge it at the same time. Another reviewer attributes this shutting down to overheating, I don't know if this is true, the device does not feel hot when it stops working.<br /><br />Finally, the blue LED is way too bright and gives you no useful information. I do not know why manufacturers want to put blue and green spotlights on their devices, but a lot of them do. This will light up a dark room, cause seizures, signal aliens from another galaxy, cause your paint peel, interfere with your sleep, induce hypnosis, and if you live on the water it could be mistaken for a lighthouse beacon.<br /><br />It comes with a velvet-like storage bag, a 3.5 mm headphone jack cable, and a mini USB cable for charging. Not a micro USB cable, so you will probably not be able to use your phone's USB cable to charge it, which means you have to carry yet another cable. It does not come with an adapter for the electrical socket to plug the USB cable in. You must have your own adapter (that probably came with your cell phone) or plug it in to your laptop or desktop computer. It will charge from an electrical socket if you have such an adapter.",3,2
It's broken in a month but the good thing was it had a lip to it so I can put it on a desk without scratching it face down,3,1
"The case is alright. The only reason I bought this case was for the price and the kickstand.  The kickstand feels kind of cheap and feels like it could break if just the right amount of pressure was applied.  When I squished the sided of my case, the colored and clear part separated and left a gap that made a slight cracking noise, but the case didn't break. I don't know how protective this case can be, but all the buttons and holes match up.  Overall I probably wouldn't buy this case again.",3,2
"The thing we had to do when we first got this is charge it for 3 hours. We tried charging it just til it stop charging, but the battery life only lasted about and hour and half. After charging 3 hours ( and it does NOT instruct you on how long to charge it in the directions) the battery life lasted several hours. It works great. And all I did to load it was use windows media player- I drop and dragged files to sync into it.",3,2
I thought I would like this cover but as it turns out I really preferred using one that opened similar to a book.  I also decided on a bright color so my Kindle would be easier to find.,3,1
"I ordered these new charges for my boyfriend and I's iPhones. I have a 4g and he has a 3gs. It said on the selling info that it would work on either. I bought two of these, the cords on them seem to be fine its the charger Dock that is bad when charging if you try to use the phone it goes all wacky and freezes. So the cord was good, dock was bad.",3,1
"I'd rather not write anything \\""bad\\"" but I don't know where these chargers are coming from that are being sold on Amazon bc they are not working effectively on the iPhone or iPad. SMH",3,2
"Sounds tinny. Also doesn't stay in my ears well. Went back to the standard Apple buds, which have superior sounds",3,2
Bought this because the ad seemed to be exactly what I was looking for. It enhanced my speaker sound in a big way and the touchscreen with stylus is great but it has more short comings and functions that don't work than ones that do. The GPS time resets itself every time you use it and cannot be set to your time zone. When I contacted the seller they advised me that they do not have any updates and could not help me with the non-working items. Not worth the money at all. Would NOT recommend to buy.,3,2
"I bought this radio for work because I had a 20 year old clock radio with no antenna that was getting tons of static!  This radio is better but I still get static.  The sound from this machine is much better.  I still only get two stations, but that is what everyone in the building is getting.  I really was hoping this product would fix the static problem!",3,2
"First and foremost let me remind people this is for $50. With that said lets get into it. For $50 dollars this mp3/mp4/mp5/pmp is decent. Its durable, nice looking, can fit in pocket however,    Pros:   *Supports most video formats without conversions. Which is awesome..you can download from youtube, dailymotion, hulu whatever you like and drop videos right on it in works fine with nice picture and sound  *Supports mp3,wma,aac, mp4, flac files  *Pretty good looking ebook thing, which lets you turn the text and zoom in  *Has time wasting swf games    Cons:  *I hate the fact that you can't add multiple songs to playlist at a time  *Cannont rename or move files on player  *Ebook only supports txt files which are time consuming to find and convert  *Volume is pretty low for music but works great on movies with headphones or hooked up to play in car  *Radio reception sucks  *No unlock button, have to slide the on button which can be annoying  *Battery life isn't that long on a single charge  *Can't change wallpaper size  *Hard to find swf games, jar games would have been much better  *Annoying clock lock screen    So that's it, this player isn't the best  however  for $50 its cool. I would use it as a temporary player until I find something I like but its not a bad player for just $50. I got it strictly for the music and video that's it the rest is just additional",3,1
It's OK?!?!?!?!  I am not a game expert so I can't really tell you anything except playing around means different things to different people.,3,2
"These walkie talkies are not so good.  Only a child who REALLY loves Strawberry Shortcake might like these.  My daughter who is now 6 got these when she was 5 (maybe 4) and still likes them but I can't stand playing with them with her.  There's A LOT of feedback and at times I can barely hear what she's saying (and she can't hear me much either.)  We have to stand within 5-10 feet of each other to get as optimal a sound as we can.  There's one button that is like a call button (makes a beeping sound) but it really only comes through when the receiver has their walkie talkie open (I thought it would be fun for it to \\""call\\"" the other walkie talkie when it's closed to warn the receiver that they have a call coming in....Nope...so I don't get the point of the \\""call\\"" button when it's only used when someone has their walkie talkie already open and in listening mode.) My daughter has been a HUGE Strawberry Shortcake fan for 2 years (just starting to come out of it) so she doesn't mind them.  But if she knew how good other walkie talkies are (i.e. what she's missing out) I'm sure she'd put these aside quickly.",3,1
Didn't change my reception at all but quality seemed okay. Guess each vehicle is different,3,2
"Ok, 3 stars because it works as stated, seamless  integration with both my car and cellphone...you cannot beat the price.<br />With that being said, the sound quality(for me) was horrid. My car has a Bose sound system and my cellphone has Harmon Kardon audio software. When I stream via this device my music sounds inferior. I gave it to a friend... She gives it 5 stars as it sounds almost identical to how her audio usually sounds in her vehicle anyway.<br />PS from what I heard, most of these (if not all) &#34;dumb down&#34; the audio quality anyway.",3,1
"This unit is only OK. It has a lot of quirks and I wish it was a lot better, but it does the job and I can't complain. Here's the issues I've noticed with it...<br />1. It disconnects in the middle of use. While playing music through the unit it will sometimes automatically disconnect. This happened a few times, and usually happens during long car rides. The unit will seem to disconnect, and then after a second or so it will reconnect to the phone.<br />2. There's no password to bluetooth connect. The directions give you a code that you can input if it does ask, but everybody I've had connect to the unit has never been asked the code, so the unit is essentially unprotected<br /><br />3. I've also had issues connecting to the device after walking away from the unit. If I happen to walk away from the unit for a few minutes and then come back to the car, the unit will still be on but the phone won't connect. I'll have to power down the unit and power it back up in order to reconnect.<br /><br />4. The directions are very simple, and miss key information. For example it doesn't tell you how to power down the unit. In order to power down the unit you need to hold the play button for a few seconds. If you have your AUX on in the car, you'll hear a sound through the speakers which designates it's powering down. Same goes for powering on...the difference is that the directions don't tell you how to power down.<br /><br />For those wondering if you can still use your car's bluetooth unit to talk, the answer is YES. The call will come in and actually go through both your car and the unit, but if you use the car's phone controls (My car has the call pickup and hangup buttons on the steering wheel) the call will be bluetoothed through your car instead of this unit.<br /><br />The unit does work, and is pretty easy to set up, but I wish it was more reliable with streaming the music. I also wish that when I start the car the unit would also start up automatically. I've got the unit plugged in constantly, so I wish that when I start the car and power would be directed to the unit, it would automatically start up (I realize that old cars sometimes don't have this function and that power is ALWAYS being directed to the ports, so it's not a deal breaker).",3,1
"So, I love the look and the texture. The only problem I have with this is that when applying the back vinyl, it is sized to curve a bit over along with the Nook. Problem with this is that it doesn't stick very well, and the edging sticks out a bit. If the backing was a slight bit smaller so that it didn't curve around the edge (I know that means exposing the Nook more around the sides), it would then show with a smooth finish. The cover should either wrap all the way around or small enough to just cover the back.",3,1
"the cassette worked for a bit, but started messing up after a couple uses... i would have rather bought one from a regular store",3,1
"After having sold my prized Sony MZR910 MD recently to purchase the H320 I was furious to discover that there seems to be pure laziness and/or stupidity on behalf of iRiver in that it does not have gapless playback. This means that if you listen to dance mixes there is an annoying gap between files when there should be a seamless transition from one track to the next. <br /> <br />Apparently this has been broached with iRiver by others but as yet they havent moved to fix this repairable annoyance by issuing the relevant firmware upgrade. <br /> <br />The only things a device needs to be able to do are: <br /> <br />a) Decode music slightly faster than real-time, so that the next track can be buffered up properly while the current one is still playing. (All MP3 players have CPUs capable of doing that these days.) <br />b) For MP3 files, support the standard LAME-encoder tag which specifies the exact length of each track. (Other formats have always had this tag.) <br /> <br />Only one device I konow of doesnt have this annoying feature and thats the RIO Karma  - wish Id known about this before I purchased. <br /> <br />Marco",3,1
Item is a bit bulky and if you over tighten it so that it stays in the cup holder it breaks rather easily. I was sent a replacement via the manufacturer with no problem or charges.,3,1
"Expecting at least be compare the Zen X-fi2 with the i-pod 'touch' it is way too much to ask... Poor respond of the touch screen, the equalization and the X-fi is horribly to the ears. But it is a good mp3 player and once you figure out how to convert videos will make this device more usable. I also use this device as a memory flash to transport my files. It isn't worth the money for what this device deliver. With $100 more and a change I could get the windows 'Zune'... but by now is too late for me to exchange it.<br />I'm ok with my Zen it just way too mediocre in comparison with the rest of these devices.",3,2
Unfortunately you cannot go down low enough in the stations sometimes to get a clear signal.  In other words - some of these let you go down to 88.9 or something like that while this one cuts you short.  Then when a radio station is picked up say at 91.1 then you have to move to 91.3 and so on.,3,2
"This was advertised as a factory refurbished product. Due to the fact that the unit was not reset to the original factory settings, nor did it come with a users manual, I don't believe the refurbished claim. As far as I know, it could have been an individual selling their old unit, or even stolen.       The unit has intermittent issues upon starting it up. Sometimes it won't boot at all.  If restart it a couple of times, it has worked. I'll be using this as a backup as I don't trust that it wont leave me stranded somewhere.  Three stars, as the price was good, it works, and it arrived in a timely fashion.  Probably should have given 2 stars.",3,1
"The car charger lasted me about five months. After that, the usb port stopped working. I would recommend investing in a better quality car charger.",3,2

"By now, everybody knows that the Droid RAZR's battery life sucks, which is why Motorola quickly introduced the RAZR MAXX.  But for those of us who got the original Droid RAZR, it's critical to have some kind of portable backup power option.<br /><br />The P793 serves this function well enough.  It's small and light.  However, it can only charge my RAZR up to 30% before running out of juice itself.  It's enough to be useful, and it can squeeze a few extra hours of life from the phone.  But it's still very disappointing. Even though it's small, I would have expected a battery of that size to hold a lot more power than it does.",3,1

"I just needed a double-DIN trim ring, not the side brackets for glomming two single-DINs together. Trim ring got the job done and the scoring on the back made trimming to size easy. All-in-all, 15-bucks for an 1/8th-inch thick piece of black plastic seems a little steep.",3,1
"This hard shell case holds the Tom Tom 4.3\\"" GPS unit firmly with built in elastics, and the attached carabiner is very handy, but there is no place to put the cord that attaches to the cigar lighter outlet in the car, so you have to carry this important attachment separately (in another case) which is a real nuisance.",3,1

"Fast Shipping, brand new product, great price, but the end did not fit into TomTom XL 340S (too large to fit into the socket due to the plastic housing around the end).  I did not return due to shipping costs.  Thanks anyway!",3,2
"I got the pink one a few months back, and I'm pretty happy with it. It protects my Zen Vision:M from scratches and the like, although I also have one of those clear stickers stuck on my screen to protect it from just that. The video stand comes in handy as well, although I've learned that it depends on how high the table you put it on is to view the screen well.  <br /> <br />My only complaint about it is that the dye used in the backing has stained the back of my Zen. So now the back has pink blotches on it. Must be from the heat of the player, because I never wet the case.",3,1
"After loading it, it died twice and had to be restarted to work.  As a longtime &#34;Wild Flower Production&#34; user, I thought there would be significant up grades and improvements.  There weren't.  Loading maps into the GPS is easy.  When I tried to print a map, even though I pulled up a print preview, 3/4 of the page was a gigantic picture of their logo.  I don't need to see their logo on my map out in the field.",3,2

"220 is an underutilized asset in the amateur community, so having a LOW cost means of working 220 is a good thing.<br />The TYT TH-9000 is a decent cheap gateway to 220.<br />Typical Chinese radio, NOT equivalent to YaeComWood.<br /><br />Pro:<br />1. 55 watts without a fan, nice for indoor air conditioned use<br />2. All the repeater necessities: tones, DTMF, scan, control via mike<br />3. Appears well made overall.<br />4. The manual, though mediocre, is better written than most cheap Chinese radio manuals.<br />5. Good audio both in and out according to QSO's.<br />6.

"Maybe I didn't take good care of it, but my headphones gave out after no more than 3 months.  The sound is very good, the comfort is very good, but now I only have sound in 1 ear.  I think this is due to how I store the item.  I usually wrap it around in a circle or around my phone and now I have to position the cord near the male insert at a certain angle to get sound.

The nubs that attach the hinge to the body are very weak plastic.<br /><br />I give it three stars because I'm still using the case even without the hinge, because it's a good case with a nice, slightly rubbery feel to it, and it doesn't attract lint.

not a bad radio but not the best,3,2
"Pro:  Once you get it to work, it's worth the $10.  Cons:  You have to find a radio setting with little or no static on it to get it to work.    There's a 'quickset' button that the instructions don't tell what it's for, and I haven't figured it out.  Oh well...  The remote control doesn't work AT ALL.  Sound quality not as good as FM radio but acceptable.",3,2
"Product is OK, it's not bad but it isn't very goo either.  In my personal opinion .. the PROS: Navigation looks nice and modern and it works (although the traffic feature I don't think works very well or doesn't work at all).  The radio interface looks nice too and it sounds good.  The unit has a TV feature, aux input which I use for the backup camera, and you can load dvd movies and songs/video through the dvd, sd micro, or the usb port. CONS: the bluetooth feature simply sucks.. you can hear static in the background when you play music and though you can Learn to deal with it, it becomes annoying as soon as you get into another vehicle and realize how good their system plays.  Don't even try talking through the bluetooth when you're driving, the other party won't hear you at all.  The system crashes unexpectedly and you have to reset it.  When it comes back online after the reset, everything sticks but the radio stations!..  For the price I guess is a good deal and it does what I wanted but if you're looking for premium sound and quality, this is not for you!",3,2
We hooked these DVD players up before leaving for vacation.  The speaker doesn't work on one of them and when you try and watch the same movie on both screens you lose a lot of the sound. They work better individually with separate movies and with headphones plugged into them.  I could barely hear with the headphones that were included.,3,2
"For the price, the clip-Dat Mini clip MP3 player provides good sound, easy pick up from the song you left off on, and convenience of portability. The biggest issue I have had with this product is that when inserting the headphones, or pressing the fast forward/rewind buttons, the pressure causes the micro SD card to pop up/out and has to be reinserted. The product I purchased did not come with the USB-HSD cord, luckily I had a spare one to attach to it. The player does not work or even read without the micro SD card,and  because there were no instructions, I found this out through trial and error. A plus is that this device can support up to a 8GB micro SD card so I can have a large selection of music at my fingertips.",3,2
It won't protect you iPod at all but it lame and it isn't really stylish like I thought it wss,3,2
its a nice portable speaker but it seems everytime i have to be putting it upside down to charge because the battery and the usb not connecting as it suppose too...also the way i saw it on the box i thought it was a little taller but it short because i cant see the pump clearly is mostly the lights i'm seeing..an last but not least when u put it to the loudest in volume the battery seems to be needing to charge very quickly before 4 hours reach...but the lights are ok that what really impresses me,3,2

"i have two videos myself I took the night that I got it.  For the price its great just missed a few things that I was looking for in the camera.  There is a small but very small delay between the files and that it says it supports 32gb sd card.  WRONG.  I bought a 16gb sdhc card to go with it but it does not work.  it would only record about 20 seconds and then stopped.  My cousin had a 2gb sd card not an sdhc card and it worked fine.  so here is my recap<br /><br />  Cons<br />-  Small delay between files<br />-  Not SDHC supported.  Make sure to buy a sd card which you cannot get any higher than a 2gb.  It may be the card i bought but i will find out in a couple days.<br /><br />If you dont know the difference between sd and sdhc cards, here is the difference.  the hc means high capacity.  there is no difference but storage capacity and the way its read by the device.  anything higher than a 2gb is sdhc.",3,1
"After returning another Lightning cable that only charged my iPhone but not my iPad, I decided to order the iSmooth 3m Lightning USB cable. I just received it today, but so far I am happy with the quality, it's a little stiffer than the Apple cable, but that's ok - it seems like it will protect the cable inside a little more and the extra length is nice. Best of all, it's charging my iPad.",3,1
"I purchased this waterproff MP3 player from B&H. Reasonably priced, extra head phones, nice little MP3 player.  However, if you download your music from Lime Wire like I do, this MP3 doesn't like Limewire, as I was told when I called tech support because I couldn't get it to accept any music.  All of my music is from Lime Wire, so unfortuately I have to return it.  It really is a shame because it is very nice!!  The tech support people told me there are \\""a few\\"" music sites that this player won't accept music from.",3,1

The product was delivered quickly and at a good price. Even with a replacement O/S (AFN) the Nook is not stable and I am convinced that Android is not a mature product to replace a desktop or laptop. If Android serves your needs this is a fine cover/keyboard but I am typing this on a laptop.,3,1

"Good sound for the money but I often have to turn the Bluetooth off and on a couple of times to get my PC to recognize it and it crackles when some Windows operations occur, such as selecting a different window while watching a movie. The biggest problem, by far, is that there is a slight delay when used with Bluetooth that puts the sound out of sync for all movies. I use VLC player and can adjust the audio delay but it is a pain. There is no delay when used with an audio cable. Obviously, it's not a problem when listening to music.",3,1

"I waited to write a review on this for many months. The reason why is that for what this device has to do it does a good job. Trying to draw on an iPad really requires something like this. And from what I hear and read many of these types of stylus fall apart. This one has served me well since I bought it. And for the price you'd think otherwise. Not so. This stylus lasts. But...<br /><br />I recently bought a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 which has a regular WACOM style stylus. If you still have an iPad, you need a stylus like this one and this is the one I'd recommend. But if drawing is important to you, I'd drop the iPad and get the Galaxy Note 10.0\\"" which comes with a proper stylus. I can finally draw without zooming in and out to gain precision that the stylus lacks. Blame Steve Jobs for that as he seems to hate the idea of a stylus. But everyone in the art world lives and breaths with a stylus in the hands. I've been lusting after the Cintiq 24\\"" HD tablet since it came out.<br /><br />I think for artist types there are few good products out there for us. Cintiq is obviously one of them. The Galaxy Note 10.1 just became another. Thank you rooCASE, you've been great but I've finally found a proper system.",3,1

It was working on one of our cables then wouldn't work on another. Haven't tried it again since. It failed on a licensed copy of the original cable. I buy this licensed brand often without fear (not a $.99 knock-off). Seems it should work with either. This was a temporary solution anyway.,3,2

"This is the best iPod/iPhone speaker I have heard, hands down.  Absolutely distortion free with strong bass and volume.  It is better than Bose, IMO.  Prior to this speaker, the best iPod speaker I had ever heard was actually made by Apple, but for some reason they didn't sell well and Apple quit making them a few years ago.  One possible reason they didn't sell well was because of the price.  They were very expensive.  And this speaker at least rivals the one Apple used to make.  Unfortunately, it is very expensive, too.  As a result, I can only give it 3 stars because the excessive price outweighs the quality of sound.  I doubt this speaker will sell very well.  Apple already found out there is a limit on the price people will pay for this type of speaker.  It's definitely the best one out there, but of course, you're paying for it.  I just can't see many people spending $400 on an iPod speaker.  There just aren't that many people who can afford it or justify it, especially in these economic times.  Even half that price would be too much.  This speaker needs to be only a little over $100 for it to sell well.  Great speaker but ridiculous price.",3,1

"I submitted some changes for Amazon to review on this product, but am not sure how long it will take for them to apply them, so I wanted to write a review detailing some of them, and giving a little additional information as well.  First of all, this is not Totes brand leather, at least not what I received in the mail.  The box very clearly says, Saddlebred brand, and describes it as \\""leatherette,\\"" which it is, not real leather. However, it is the color and size that I wanted, and the price is good, I just wish I knew ahead of time what I would actually be getting.  The color is a nice attractive dark brown which I was happy with (I really didn't want black).  The dimensions are 8.5 inches long, 6.75 inches deep, and 4.25 inches high.  It seems to be put together reasonably well, and if I didn't feel as if I had been deceived by the product's original description, I would be much happier with it.  Just wanted to add a further note, because the price has gone up significantly since I made my purchase: it's not worth the new price, because it isn't real leather. If I had paid the price they're charging now, I would have returned it when I actually saw what I was getting in the mail.",3,1
I got this for my daughter and she accidently get it wet and after it didn't work. I contacted the customer service and water damage is not covered. I think I will go thru other sources from now on that do cover accidents like that with in the 90 days.

"have a 2006 Chevrolet Aveo, with a Jensen sound system with MP3 and DVD capabilities. I must first comment that my sound system has an excellent sound quality since it was tested in a show room, and it really sounds good! <br /> <br />The Aveo, by default, has 4 one-way-speakers and 2 twisters, and my intention was to upgrade the sound quality so I could listen to electronic music and acid jazz with the best possible quality, without doing any size modifications to the default speaker slots. <br /> <br />Results: My original speakers would only allow me to set the volume at 15/30. I bought this model thinking that I was about to get more volume, with better quality. At a low volume, you do get a clear sound though, but you can't get it louder because you will get distortion, and bass eats all clarity. Imagine some speakers having a cold... yep, it sounds just like that, because the speakers have low watts and very small twisters. <br /> <br />Conclussions: <br /> <br />If Usher or 50 Cent is your stuff, these are definitely not for you. <br /> <br />If you're older than 40, these will give you exactly what you're looking for (I'm 27 as of now) <br /> <br />I'd recommend buying at least 6-1/2'' four-way speakers.",3,1

"I bought this for my husband because the other elastic armbands were too small for his large arms.  This one said it could be used for a leg, so I thought I would give it a shot, especially since it was so inexpensive.  It is cheaply made, and the fasteners are little dots of velcro.  Also, if you're working out such that your arm might be upside down, there is the possibility that the iPod would fall out.  However, it does serve its function.  I'm not sure how long it will last, but it is worth the price.",3,2
"This item has been described improperly. Great product but DOES NOT STREAM MUSIC OVER BLUETOOTH! All other features work as described. Phone calls, check! Clear sound, check! Music, half check...

If you want to stream music over Bluetooth, buy somewhere else!",3,2
I liked the bundle. It's worth the $20 for the accessories and found them all useful. The only thing I was dissatisfied with is the power plug in adapter.

"I cant seem to find a software that works flawlessly with this thing.I have tried MusicMatch,Media Monkey,Media Jukebox,Rhapsody and they all tend to freeze up when loading songs on to this thing,so I am assuming it is a flaw in the product.Other than that it sounds decent,its little enough to put anywhere,although it is a tad bulky for its size.It only holds like 150 songs for me,so I am looking to upgrade soon.",3,1
This item is good for kids as a beginner toy. It was really easy to set up and very easy to learn how to use. My daughter loved it.,3,1
"I like this case, but I have a strong feeling that it won't last long.  It doesn't fit my Ipod perfectly, so the edges are always coming loose.  I can see how it will lose it's shape and/or rip in the near future.... I think I am going to order a hard case as a back up.    As for the screen protector... great idea and the main reason I ordered this product.  However, I ruined it trying to get it flawlessly on my Ipod (my own fault, I know).  Just be very careful not to get any dust or lint on the sticky side..... there will be no chance of removing it all and the screen protector will be useless!!",3,1

"It worked for me, although I couldn't take off the seat belt chime.  I had to go to the dealer to do that.  I was able to reprogram many other things though.  I couldn't get it to work with my newer laptops but I was able to get it to work with an old Windows XP laptop.  Luckily I had that old timer sitting around.",3,2
"I just tried installing this yesterday and the instructions are a little vague. I was told it would come with all of the installation hardware, but it didn't. I'm a little frustrated at the moment, but trying to be optimistic. I haven't finished the installation process as I'm waiting for some hardware to arrive. The product looks good though and arrived quickly. Not sure on the quality yet since it's not installed but I guess that would be Alpine's problem, not the retailers.",3,2
"I am sorry I really haven't had this product to give it a proper rating, but thus far it is just fine.",3,1
"I am having a hard time getting information or trouble shooting this product. In the instructions it says hit the &#34;&#60;&#34; or &#34;&#62;&#34; buttons to seek or tune your preset stations. These &#60; and &#62; buttons are not on the device does this mean I need an app or another device? I tried FM radio but couldn't tune in anything, nothing at all. After that I tried to insert an sd card and it wont stay in. It hooked up last night to Bluetooth just fine on my Samsung note 4 and was working and sounding good. Today after I plugged it into the laptop to give it a charge it stopped working all together. As of now when I turn on the device the light just stays green. I have high hopes for this device as it has some sturdy weight to it in your hand but the bottom plastic assembly where the buttons are feel wonky and sloppy. I have emailed and called the manufacture only just now so I assume it will take a day or so till I get a response for technical support. I give three stars because it shows promise, sounds great in many outside applications. Everyone was genuinely impressed that such good sound came out of it. I look forward to hearing back from technical support because I am really anxious to try the paring option with another. The current price here on amazon seems fair but if the buttons were tighter and more resistant to dirt I would definitely agree the with full price suggested at Studio Dome official website. PS is there a &#34;reset&#34; pin hole button like most devices or is it a button combination because the &#34;mic&#34; hole looks like a reset button that you would stick a tac in to clear the current problem of it being frozen up. I'm think put a little &#34;mic&#34; symbol above the mic hole so nobody tries to stick a needle in there. Yes the instructions have a diagram but its so small I hard time reading it. I will follow up with a review of how technical support goes and adjust the star rating accordingly.",3,1
"A digital read-out would make a lot of difference in this item.  Trying to tune it as a radio, either AM or FM, is tricky, to say the least.  Besides having only an approximation of where on the bandwidth that you are, the tuning knob is small and the movement fast.  It's a lot like the old vest-pocket radios in that respect.  I think I will use it only for MP3 disks and forget the radio.",3,1
"Got this cable a while ago but haven't used it heavily yet. I noticed it doesn't charge sometimes on one of the cables but gets fixed after moving the connector little bit. It's moderately priced compared to other cables, so didn't expect it to break intermittently like this. Moreover, look and feel of the cable is good but not as great as other cables such as Amazon or Chromo.",3,1
"Ordered this item and received in a timely manner.  It came without any instructions.  It's very light weight plastic.  It came with a string lancet but I have no clue as to where it goes since there are no instructions.  It has a kick-stand on the back so the ipod can sit horizontal or vertical. Because it's so flimsy, and I didn't want to break it, it took a while to figure how to turn (twist) the stand on the back and how to open the stand.  Is says it's a belt loop but have not figured how to work it in that fashion yet.  Instructions would have been nice but since they did not come with case they should have been added in the on-line specs of the case.",3,1
"I got this because I have heard a few of the nicer ones and was really impressed with the bass and sound quality from such a tiny speaker, but I guess I got what I paid for with this cheaper knock-off. It does sound pretty good and loud for it's size but there is a few things that are not quite as good about this particular make and model.<br /><br />The bass is not near as rich as what I've heard from the others makes, even with this speaker fully extended. In fact there's not much of a difference at all when you do open and extend this one. That was a bit of a disappointment.<br /><br />Another big difference is battery life. Granted you can listen to it while it is charging which makes it fine for using it with a netbook or laptop but if you're wanting to add some volume to an iPod or other media player, then you're limited to the life of the battery which can very a LOT depending on the volume, amount of bass it plays, and how well it charged or kept it's charge which can be a real crap-shoot. There is no way to tell if it is still charging, when it is done charging, or how much of a charge it has. I can also tell the battery doesn't last as long as it did when it was new, yet mine isn't that old at all.<br /><br />Finally the biggest problem I had with this cheaper version is the fact that you can't daisy-chain a second (or 3rd or 4th) speaker from it. The others I have seen in the past had an output 3.5mm jack that you could plug in a second (or more) speaker into, and what was ingenious was that it switched to the opposite channel so that if the first speaker was playing the right channel then the second one would be playing the left channel so you could hear the play back in stereo. This one omits that and only allows you to hear mono playback from this speaker with no place for a second one to plug in.<br /><br />Now if you're just looking for a way to amplify that tiny MP3 player or netbook you bought so that it can be heard at a decent volume and these other functions aren't the reason why you were looking for such a tiny speaker then yes, this one can be a good choice for an extremely frugal price, but I went into this long rendition of what this one was like so you'd know what to expect from what you're buying.her functions aren't the reason why you were looking for such a tiny speaker then yes, this one can be a good choice for an extremely frugal price, but I went into this long rendition of what this one was like so you'd know what to expect from what you're buying.",3,1

When installing, the caps on the end would sometimes pop off due to the awkward shape of them not neatly sitting in the clamps, but if you put them back on it'll still work when you fit them in good enough. The light that this gives off is not plain old LED white, but more of a xenon white. Remember to match the poles correctly. There are no indicators, so if it doesn't light the first time, try switching the bulb around.

It only lets me use the skip, play/pause, volume controls etc.  Yet it still does what it is advertised for and I have not had any problems so far.",3,1
"Good little sounding speaker, but battery like is pretty bad. My other BT speaker lasts 10x's linger",3,1
"This is an okay speaker if you just want a speaker that is easy to carry and has a loud volume, but has its issues.<br /><br />First Impressions: Packaging is pretty simple. You pull out a plastic tray and are greeted with the speaker, along with a small box with an aux cable and a micro-USB cable. You also get a quick-start guide. The speaker feels pretty small. Pairing it to my phone was a breeze. It appears as MOCREO Tictac. The speaker can get pretty loud. However, when trying to control the volume via the buttons on the speaker, there is a small delay when pressed. You would have to push the button, and then wait 1-2 seconds for the volume to be affected. If you repeatedly press the button, it won’t work. The speaker is made of a plastic that seems like it would withstand a fall.<br /><br />After using it for a while, I found a problem with the speakerphone functionality. When making calls with the speaker, when you are on the receiving end on the phone, you can hear an annoying humming noise throughout the call that does not go away. When you hear people through the speaker, sound quality is fine, but after you hang up on them, you can hear a small humming noise from the speaker. I would say that the only way this speaker is useful is for listening to music. The sound quality of music is good, and the speaker can get pretty loud for its small size. I like the necklace, but I wish I could take the necklace off. The necklace is basically built into the speaker and cannot be removed. Aside from these issues, if you’re looking for a speaker that you’ll only use for music, this speaker is for you. Otherwise, I think you can find another speaker elsewhere.<br /><br />Battery life is okay, it should last you 4-5 hours. The app that has been developed to use alongside the speaker is gimmicky, but<br />I understand that this speaker is still a startup product and Mocreo is still improving it along with the app in every detail.<br /><br />I would recommend this only topeople that will want to use it to listen to music while doing an activity and don’t want to spend too much on a speaker.<br /><br />Overall, I give this speaker a three star rating due to its issues. Hopefully, they will be resolved in the future.<br /><br />I was supplied a unit for testing purposes and I promised to provide a completely honest and fair review.",3,1

"I ordered one of these because a friend at the spa I am at was using it and really loves it.  The sound is excellent she says.  I have a Swim Monkey and decided to upgrade based on her input.  Unfortunately it took 5 days for the seller to ship it and 14 days later it still hasn't arrived. If it does ever arrive, I will have already departed. Amazon supersaver shipping is ordinarily excellent, but failed dismally in my case.",3,1
"The charger and usb cable will be very useful, also the screen protector, don't know about the skin cases yet, will know more when used. Recieved order on time. Would order from company again.",3,1
item works fine charges phone as well<br />only thing the next doesnt stay in the upright postions whenever you turn a corner it slides,3,2
It is not what I expected it to be I don't have any more to say about the product. Kidding right!,3,2
"Wire broke very easily , mostly insulation , not heavy wire.<br /><br />Very nice connectors and fuses..... would not purchase again though",3,1
"I gave it a three due to its limited uses.  I have an older generation ipod nano that doesn't have Nike+ installed. I use the sensor with my ipod.  The armband doesn't allow me to use it due to the closure at the bottom. I don't want to cut the closure due to the ipod already slipping out at the top.  I plan to get a ipod with the Nike+ installed and hopefully this will help.  I like that it doesn't stretch; this could help keep it shape and durability longer.  But hey, like everyone has said, you get what you pay for.",3,1
"It was fine for my first Nook, but does not fit the new model. I had to tape it to keep the Nook from falling out. Also the magnet for the tab came loose and slides around inside the cover.",3,2
"Charged in 2 hours, ok",3,1
Started as per instructiuons.  So far ok. Will have to see if it maintains temps. and performs for more than one season.,3,1
"It is very low quality because it fell apart when I pulled it off the power strip.  I had to use the office tape to hold it together.  So far, it is charging my iphone4 just fine as long as I don't pull it off the power strip.",3,2
"I didn't have this case for very long without breaking it - and I'm not one to fiddle with things until they break. The front half of the case is very thin, and is easily breakable. Once you put this case on, don't take it on and off multiple times, because it's guaranteed to break. This would definitely still work well, though, if you just leave the case on.",3,2
I was surprised on how flimsy this item felt so I decided to not wire it in my motorcycle electrical system. As far as its usability I can't say since i have never attached it to anything to make that judgement. I would think it would be okay in a stationary indoor environment but its construction made me nervous to use on a motorcycle.,3,2
"It was actually a little smaller than I expected. It was a nice hard case, but no room to put the adapter in with it.",3,1
"The battery was the correct shape, voltage, and capacity but have the wrong connector. If you are handy with very small wires and good with a soldering iron you can make the make the battery work.",3,1
Product works great except for the routing of the wires through your uniform to protect them from snagging if left on the outside of your uniform.  This process is simply too cumbersome.,3,1
"Cute, just made from plastic so not as durable as others.  The design looks great, it is just is not as durable as we had hoped.",3,1
"This has all the adjustable features you would want for a footrest.  The quality of the platic is great.    However, the rubber that your rest your feet on smell so bad that I'm sure whoever makes this footrest will have cancer.  I had to leave it in the garage for days before I could use it and I'm sure to not put my bare feet on it.  Lawyers, have at it.",3,1
"i thought I had ordered the same style I had  previously which has a stand built in, this one does not and was basically the same price.",3,2
"I bought this case for a Coby Kryos 7\\"" tablet pc. It's great as far as size & having enough room for accessories, but there are NO straps to keep the tablet in place. It has fallen out of the case twice when I opened it, just because I had the case turned  the wrong way.  This case really needs some kind of straps on the inside to hold the tablet. I'm going to try to add some elastic straps myself just so I don't accidentally drop the tablet again.   The whole purpose of the case is to \\""protect\\"" the tablet!!!! The price is great for bare minimum protection, but it's probably worth paying a little more for more protection.",3,1
"This receiver worked, under Windows, for an hour or so, then bombed out. I fought it for several days, installing and uninstalling many different drivers, but could not get it to work. Tried it under Linux with TangoGPS and it just plain works, every time, no problems. Got a GlobalSat on the way, giving up on this one with Windows.",3,2
The sound on the speaker is good.  It does not have a seperate volumn control.  The volumn control on my ipad works well with this speaker.,3,1
"These were very cute, but one of the ears broke off.",3,2
"One of the better remote car starts for the money, I've purchased 3 of them and installed them in 3 different makes/models. However, the 2-way remotes apparently have an issue as 2 of the 3 have stopped working entirely. The remote still powers on, but does not appear to transmit anything. The one-way remotes work fine. Unfortunately, CrimeStopper offers no warranty or support whatsoever for their product and insist that I must return the entire device to replace the remote. I have no interest in uninstalling the whole thing just to get a remote (which cannot be purchased separately) so my &#34;2-way&#34; car starter is effectively now only a 1-way.",3,2
"Dosn't look exactly like it does on the picture. It feels kinds weird but that's just me. It reminds me on the steelers a little bit. It is very very hard to get off your ipod and i have a docking station and 2 other cases so i have to take it off alot. i hope it gets a little easier in the next few days. also, during me trying to take it off, 2 crystals fell off, so this isnt the best case to buy but it is my first crystal one so maybe all crystal ones do.",3,1
"Not a bad deal, but I had to request a replacement cord, since the one I had gotten was defective. Lots of neat little things with the package - my only big issue, is that I cant get the arm strap tight enough to stay on when I run. Its obviously made for a man, or someone with larger muscles.",3,1
"I initially thought this product was a great deal.  Much cheaper than the local box store.  But I could not get the speakers provided to work because none of the cords in accessories package make sense.  One end should plug into the ipod and one into the speakers, yet there seems to be no cord provided that does this. I didn't know that you could plug in at the earphone outlet and then into the speakers. Also it would help to have instructions for the FM radio option. There are no instructions which is not good.  The item was not very expensive so I decided not to return it but I didn't get to use all the items, instructions would be nice!!!!!",3,2
"the item is not bad, it is useful and protects the kindle in a sufficient way. It would be better if it had a transparent cover for the screen too as it would be all in one.   The leather quality is very bad.",3,1
"I recently bought the Garmin Nuvi 205.  So I bought this silicone cover because I thought this would be good protection.  I received it and put it on my Garmin.  It is pretty loose fitting.  Almost too loose.  Also, the cover has a cutout on the back so you can plug the charger in while the cover is on.  However, it doesn't exactly line up to the plug-in and I have to manuver the cover to plug in the charger.  The silicone is flimsy and seems easy to tear.  I am going to be using my Garmin a lot and I have a feeling that I am going to pay for a replacement cover soon.",3,1
The case is fine.  The protective screen used adhesive on the tabs that remained as a stubborn residue that catches dust and debris.,3,1
Actually I have not yet figured out how to assemble the several parts. It almost seems too complex! No directions or schematic provided.,3,1
"I bought this windshield mount after breaking two mounts from Garmin. The cradles from Garmin break on the back side where the ball snaps in. While this mount is better than the original mount because it uses a well designed connetion using screws, it does not permit use of the Garmin traffic alert antenna power cord. I would not have bought this unit had I known of this deficiency, but I will keep and use it for the times that my traffic alert subscription is unusable due to lack of local FM station that broadcasts the traffic alerts. If you do not use the traffic alert system, this mount is an excellent replacement for the poorly designed mount from Garmin.",3,1
The instructions could have been written in better detail hard for the average person to do. Get ready to pay a professional installer to do the job,3,1
"I ordered these to replace some portable units that had been in use and were ready to be retired. I specifically ordered this bundle because they were supposed to come with the cigarette lighter adapters for the power connections to allow easier installation and to prevent having to splice wiring. Unfortunately, the units shipped without the adapters and as I'd read, the install instructions are pretty  near worthless. It took several hours to get the wiring sorted out and not before I'd blown one of the fuses in the unit (there are no spare fuses provided for just such an occasion so it meant a trip to the auto parts store late in the evening). The quality of the units are pretty low but that's to be expected at this price point. Again the most painful and concerning thing here is that they don't take the time to make the installation much easier on these by including the adapters and as I said, an extra fuse or two wouldn't hurt since just touching the power to ground will blow one (they are 2amp fuses).  as far as customer service goes, I had really no luck getting Amazon to contact the company and get the adapters shipped out. My options were, Return them and get a full refund, install them and get a partial refund for the missing adapters, but they would not or could not contact the seller and see if they could send the promised and missing parts. That was pretty frustrating and the partial refund was less than expected for the units.   Overall, i rated these neutral as they do seem to work well, but they look/feel cheaper than expected and were not fun to install. I gave a lower overall rating to my shopping experience with amazon due to the above-mentioned issues contacting the seller.",3,2
"Noticeable lag occured with my bluetooth headset (around 3/4 of a second) which made anything other than music use impossible. I also had some initial difficulty connecting to my bluetooth headset,",3,1

"Its a nice case.  However, do not and I say again, do not charge your Archos with your tablet in this case, you will burn up the Archos.  Take it out and charge your tablet then put it back in.  The case is great but that was the only problem I had.  I had to return mine for repair because the tablet got too hot in the case during charging.",3,1
"This is an acceptable basic boombox, with good features, average sound quality, bad controls & software. It's cheaply made, but that seems to be a universal trend in consumer electronics.",3,2
Good but does turn a gross yellow after a few months. Stays in The ipod pretty well. Worth the price.,3,1
I thought it was clear.  I have a pretty pink walkman and I can't see the color through this cover.  Other than that it protects well.<br /><br />Thanks,3,1
"I've had this clock radio for a couple of years.  I loved it for it's good sound quality, automatic clock set, and sleep features. The audio was good enough that I was able to put away my cumbersom boom box. A towel solved the problem of a too bright display even set on dim.   Suddenly it stopped - no sound from radio or CD. I would like to replace it with the same model, but 2 years for a clock radio is too short a life span. I had thought that Brookstone would ensure a more durable product, but maybe I was fooled by the slick catalogue.",3,1
"Worked well for about 1 year. Stopped working completely, so now I have to buy another one. But it's so cheap that you can't really fault the product, you get what you pay for.",3,2
This charger is great but unfortunately does not fit in my car.  I have a floor shift that will not go into park when it is<br />plugged into the outlet.,3,2
I was thoroughly disappointed with what I thought was a good idea and now don't think it was worth the price I paid for it!,3,2
"I've had this case for a good while only because I haven't gotten around to replacing it.  <br /> <br />Good points: <br />-The access to the USB connector on the bottom is wide enough to plug in and get out conveniently. <br />-The case is a sturdy plastic and I have dropped this a couple of times with no cracks or damage. <br /> <br />Bad points: <br />-The hole in the top is only good for pretty much the earbuds that come with the ipod. I had to open up the case to plug in my Sony MDR-V600's because the hole was too small. <br />-This unit has a flip top. So you have to slide your entire Ipod in through the top. The fit is so tight that on the way in the case scratches the Ipod face and the Ipod scratches the inside of the case making the view to your screen a little foggy. Good thing this comes with a screen protector, otherwise I'd be pretty upset with this. I use Displex to polish down the scratches on the body. <br />-The silicon clickwheel protector is a good idea in concept but in reality it feels like poop under your thumb and it attracts dust which makes it feel \\""gritty\\"". <br /> <br />The long and the short.. I'm not that happy with the case and I'll be trying Griffin iClear Case next.",3,1
Aesthetically pleasing.. But it lacks a whole where the charger plugs in and when you take a picture the flash reflects partly off of the case so the pictures have a pinkish color to them.   I got a lot of compliments on the case though!,3,1
good quality and it fits. and reasonable price.,3,1
Very small and very for foreign made...,3,1
The directions for programing this remote are quite confusing. They are written as though you have experience and work with these type of electronics on a regular basis. I am reasonably good at figuring things out when trying to fix something around the house. I could not follow these directions and didn't get a lot of help when I emailed the company. I think they tried to help but again assumed I knew way more about programing car remote fobs than I do. The price was good and the remote was like what I was trying to replace but I could not get it to work. I even tried another method I found on the internet to program this...but couldn't get it to work either. You may be better at programing car remotes than I but just in case be wary of this being a simple project.,3,2
"This is not the fault of the product (I don't think).    Turns out my iPhone 3G motherboard is fractured (cracked) right where this connects (there is a screw hole exactly beside it.  Maybe that screw was tightened too tight long ago to cause the crack.    Either way, if this is actually your issue it was easy to install and I´m glad at least that is new inside my phone now - though I still have no Wi-fi reception.",3,1
"So overall this is a good little system, easy to use and perfect for my office. I'm using it at work and it does the job but one thing that's very odd is: The aux jack to plug in your ipod is on the back of the system. Randomly the switch to turn the stereo over to the Aux input is also the same switch position for the radio. meaning, you can click on alarm, cd, or radio/aux. With that said as soon as I plug in the cord into the back of the stereo in the aux slot, the radio instantly switches over to aux. even if I don't have my ipod plugged in yet. So now I have to plug and unplug the aux cord each time I want to use my ipod, which the plug is in the back, when it should be in the front. If someone has a suggestion on how to make this work I'll adjust my rating..until then..",3,1
"Wasn't that good, I don't think I would buy another one. Don't have much to say about it just more junk!",3,2
"Perhaps the word &#34;genuine&#34; should have been replaced with &#34;refurbished&#34;, or &#34;rebuilt&#34;. And, therefore the price sould have been substantially lower. That being said, this was the only gig in town, and the part did work.",3,2
"This Alpine power pack is a nice option for the price but just didn't give me the performance I wanted. For just a little but more money you can get a Rockford Fosgate PBR amp that will also fit behind the dash or small place and will offer a lot more power and much better sound. I'm using the PBR with an Alpine head unit, Infinity Kappa fronts and Alpine SPR-60's, and love the sound.",3,1
It arrived fast and looked just like the picture...but it will not stay snapped together so we just threw it away. But my 8 year old loves the pen.,3,1
"Please note that the product description reads as follows: \\""Dekcell Battery for Sandisk Sansa E250 E280 MP3 Player with Tool\\"".  I was disappointed to find that there was no tool included in my order, though the battery was as advertised and meets the requirement for my E280 MP3 player.  The battery took a charge like a champ and is performing as expected.  Just make sure you go out and buy a separate jeweler's screwdriver as you will not receive a \\""tool\\"" with your order.",3,1
not real bright,3,1
"The product itself isn't horribly bad.  Reception is mediocre, but, that can be remedied with antenna alterations.  Since I am part of the Skywarn network, i did find the Skywarn 'button' to be interesting.  It allows you to program a frequency that the local Skywarn HAM operators use to communicate about the current conditions.  Actually a cool idea!<br /><br />What bothers me is the seller sent me a box that looks like it was picked up at a fire sale!  The box was damaged, no documentation, no power supply. And somehow the unit itself was covered in dust!  Extremely dissapointing...<br />So -<br /><br />Product isn't that bad... some cool features, ok reception, etc.<br />I was more dissapointed in the condition of the unit that arrived.",3,2
looks nice but the skin peels or flakes off after a very short amount of time. may be because of slipping into and out of pocket but that is what most does with them so beware.,3,2
"This is a sturdy boombox.  The sound is clear and strong.  My only complaint is that the controls are difficult to locate and it has MP3 player bay, but does not accept MP4, but that was my mistake, I thought the connection would be the same.  It is fairly large and heavy, but I bought it for my 8 year old son, so that's good because it is less likely to be thrown around.",3,2
"The receiver's reception is good, its easy to control and read. Unfortunately I tried two units and the line out was over modulated on both. One review I found suggested that grounding the unit or waiting to the unit warmed up would resolve the issue. Neither worked for me so I'm using the FM Modulation which works well, but it some ways defeats the purpose of listening to HD radio.",3,2
"apparently very picky about which cars even though same obii they will work on, one model(96 Grandam) from same manufacturer may work while another will not(97 sunfire)",3,2

"The speakers installed easy enough but overall I expected a little more from them. While I didn't expect big bass from these I did expect more than I got. The mid and high frequencies were excellent and I would only recommend these if they are paired with a good set of 6\\""9\\"" or preferably a subwoofer to handle the bass. All in all only a slight upgrade from the stock speakers.",3,1
"The ipod I received works great! The accessories, however, could be better. The cord to connect to the computer is kinda spotty, and the volume control on the earbuds doesn't &#34;click&#34; on both sides.",3,1
"For the price, this isn't bad at all. The sound quality is decent enough, and the connection process is incredibly simple. My only real complaint is that the suction cup does not stick at all - I have to prop it up against a towel rod in my shower instead of it just sticking to the wall.",3,1
work okay there knot going to hold your glasses real firm I found if you use two its better.,3,2
Get what you pay for,3,2
"It is the old story, you get what you pay for, that is price! Read the blog before buying for details of issues. If you buy a high price unit it will give you better pictures and features but for the money and my first unit it works.

like I said its ok but vol is much to low to here /holding bracket is to thin to support/ holding device,3,1
Sounds is just ok.  Probably will replace in near future with better quality speaker.,3,1
"I really liked the price for both the cover and the decal.  I will say that the skin art decal was a little small on the touch screen area. It feels like I can't access the full screen.  I've gotten used to it but at first I felt like I couldn't get it to work.  The leather cover book is awesome. My favorite part is when I'm reading.  I fold it back and snap it open.  It feels like a real book and releaves some of the stress from my wrist or fingers when reading for a long time.  Overall, a good purchase for the price.",3,1
fm transmitter is wery weak but the aux output works very well,3,1
"I guess I never noticed that this wasn't highlighted in the features, but holy crap this screen does NOT repel smudges. I had a screen protector on my LG DARE that never got smudgy or greasy. As soon as I finished applying this one to my iPhone, there were fingerprints all over the front, which are difficult to wipe away. In fact, it just looks like you moved your good ol finger grease around the screen instead of off it when wiped.     I did get bubbles on the side, but to be fair, I'm terrible at applying these things. The bubbles are on the side and the packaging says that those go away after a few days use.     Anyway, 3 stars only because they never actually say that this is a smudge free screen protector. If they did, it would've been a 2 star review.",3,2
"Overall, the shield fulfills it's purpose.  However, there are a number of improvements that can be made.<br /><br />First, the shield could be deeper.  Its current design does not completely block the reflection of the screen on our vehicle's windshield.  This is only an issue at night and I should be able to block it by adding some paper or thin plastic.<br /><br />Second, the clips on the back have lost their spring due to sitting in the sun / hot vehicle.  They still keep the shield in place though.<br /><br />Third, I added some 1/16 inch self-stick foam to the edges where it touches the GPS to reduce the chance of scratching the case.",3,1

"these are a great set of lil speakers. i use them in my gaurd shack at work and they do exactly wat i bought them for...so i dont have to wear headphones. the only drawback is the fact that they didnt come with an ac adaptor, and i had to spend 10 bucks+ shippin for the ac cord.",3,1
"Very light and only has a few functions. Play, pause, skip forward, skip back, and on/off. But it works well.",3,1
turned out to be a little bit of a  &#34;baggy&#34; fit. i was looking for something a little for snug but overall it does the job. not bad,3,1
"I bought this because I have a similar stereo system and I needed to replace the CD player.  For some reason it would not accept the identical woofer system from my system so I replaced the woofer and the woofer cord has a slice in it.  Nothing serious, I taped it, but it would have been nice if someone had quality controlled the pieces.  I had some problems with getting the item much later than expected, however, the seller was quick to react and credit my shipping costs.",3,1
"Although I really like the purple plaid design of this case (definitely met my expectations), I was disappointed in the quality.  The pattern around the edges of the plastic, especially the corners, is somewhat distorted, giving it a \\""chipped\\"" appearance (even though it's not really chipped). Also, the edges of the plastic are not smooth in some places and the plaid stripes do not quite match up around the edges where the front of the case snaps onto the back.  If you want a pretty design for your case and do not want to spend a lot of money to get a good quality product, this case would be sufficient for you.",3,2
"The Uniden HomePatrol scanner is the easiest scanner to use that I've owned. You can update its database with ease and it makes scanning fun. I'm even thinking of selling my other scanners and getting one more of these because it's so easy to use and setup. So, why am I only giving it a three out of five? Even though I bought it for a great price and I love this scanner, the retail on this thing is over $500. You can buy an iPhone and get yourself a scanner App and be able to do a lot more. You also have to pay another $99 to access the \\""Extreme\\"" features of this unit. For $500 Uniden should have included these features with it. The fact that you have to pay extra is an insult. The unit does however come with the following:  - 4 x AA size Rechargeable NiMH Batteries (2300mAh)  - AC Adapter (AC 120V 60Hz 9V 800mA Regulated)  - DC Adapter (DC 12V to DC 9V 800mA Regulated)  - 2 GB micro SD for storing favorites lists and recording transmissions  - Antenna  - Desk Stand  - USB Cable  Fairly generous compared to what I received with my RadioShack Pro96 scanner. Again, for $500 I would have also included the following:  - GPS Cable  - Mobile mount  - Protective case  By biggest gripe is this unit seems cheaply made and if I dropped it I think that would be it. It should have been made more rugged for $500 otherwise it is a fantastic unit.",3,1
"I was a little disappointed in how flimsy the sleeve is. Its very flexible. It doesn't fit my iPad as snuggly as I'd like, either. There's like an extra inch on its long end. I do love the pouch on the exterior though.",3,1

"I have been using a chromebook for last 18 months almost. Its Samsung. Now looking to  buy one more in view of extra user at home.

"Got a great deal on a refurb, directly from the Sony store. It's not a bad thing to buy last years model at a huge discount and get a matching cover for free. The reader is a great unit, one of the lightest out there with very clear readability, all necessary connectivity, SD extendable, even plays MP3s. Fits any pocket. No regrets here. So far so good, where I have to take the stars off is for the software. Over and over I ran into a corrupted reader database, listing books as to be deleted, no way to get rid of these entries. After some struggling I found the reader sync to be responsible for this, after a few syncs you may see books appearing twice in the software's inventory but not physically on the reader. The minute you detect this you are doomed. Since then I'm staying away from the sync feature, instead side-load the reader and have it maintain it's database. If stuck with a corrupted database, delete it from the reader and have it rebuilt. Only problem is the loss of status info, e.g. what book you had read, what page you were on etc. There really is no need to use the PC/Mac Reader software, features are poor, you can easily end up with duplicates in your library, and the much discussed sync bug. The readers content is easily accessible via USB mount, load and back it up that way. If you are technically savvy you can manage, but shouldn't have to, Sony needs to fix this.",3,1
I have seen other comments on the internet saying that this produce by Dragon Guages is poor.  Not sure if I am even going to install it.,3,2
"I am a Cowon believer; I used my Cowon D2 thousands of times for music purposes: recording performances, rehearsing my dance class, and listening. When it died (and only because the power switch broke off), I wanted to host a funeral. The next obvious purchase was the D20. It is a glorified version of the D2, but the screen sensitivity is worse, and the small icons you have to use to switch between folders and screens within the new UI are difficult to use because they are not very responsive and erratic - some days they work alright, others they don't. The UI has been updated to look more modern, which translates to more complicated. There are lots of other functions for this mp3 player which I never use, and didn't on the D2, either: calculator, typist, favorites, pictures, video - basically, I don't use anything but the music functions. pictures and video are pretty pointless because they don't run the normal file types we use in America. Unlike the D2, it did not come with a stylus (OR an AC wall charger, FYI).<br /><br />you buy this thing for the sound and because you refuse to use Apple. The sound does not disappoint.<br /><br />My middle button, which is the only way I can see to get back to the main menu of icons, doesn't work; only when pressed in conjunction with the right button do you have a prayer of getting back to the main menu.  .<br /><br />The scrolling arrows are now on the upper right, and very small, whereas on the D2 they were smack dab in the middle of the screen, and fatter, so you didn't have quite the chance of pressing the wrong thing or too hard or soft and you didn't have to use only your nails. It is very hard to select one folder, as you cannot tell which one is highlighted for use. I have wasted a lot of time in class fiddling with this terrible touchscreen built for the hands of mice, accidentally selecting the wrong track.<br /><br />Another thing the D20 has that the D2 did not is a speaker; the speaker is alright, and the volume output is pretty good; however, it will come on randomly. I will select a track and it will play silently, and then sometimes I select a track and the speaker magically comes on.<br /><br />I had emailed the company to see if the Z2 multimedia player (which runs on Android) had the same microphone quality, because the microphone on the D2 (and the D20) are stupendous for such a small machine, and they were a bit slow getting back to me, so I went ahead and got the D20 (by the way, if you're curious, the Z2 does have the same microphone).  I see now that I should have gotten the Z2 because it plays more relevant file types.<br /><br />UPDATE 02.19.14: It took forever to get here, despite my paying $40 extra for expedited shipping, but we have had terrible weather this winter, so maybe that was why. The company was nice enough to credit me the expedited difference in cost; however, I have had this about a month, and the screen went black tonight, and won't work, except the backlight is on. I can't shut it off, and my computer will no longer recognize the device. This is disappointing, because my Cowon d2 lasted forever.<br /><br />UPDATE 04.14.14: The problem was solved by pressing the \\""reset\\"" button with the tip of a pen. Still think the UI is full of too many unnecessary screens and junk. could use simplification; user tip: when in doubt, press the middle button/tab to get back to the main menu.output is pretty good; however, it will come on randomly.

"Sounds good, but the features leave much to be desired",3,1
It does not  give off enough heat  as i initially thought,3,2
the armband does hold my 80 gb ipod but I find that it's a little too big for my arm (and I do not have skinny arms) and the velcro is tearing already as I try to tighten it enough so that it doesn't slip down my arm.,3,2
"This protector is okay. I am slightly disappointed since it is one of the highest rating screen protector on amazon. The rainbow effect is pretty bad. As soon as I removed the protective layer, the rainbow was very very obvious. BUT, the rainbow is not as bad once my screen is active (or lit). So unless you have a dark background on your active screen, the rainbow should not be an issue.",3,2
It looks great. Now if it would fit properly. The silicone stretches to much making the headphone jack and hold button inaccessible. and the stretches so much around the click wheel as well making it look weird. The outer black layer fits fine but doesn't offer much protection for the iPod. Ill be returning this one sadly.<br />Side note; the little tea packet that came with it was fantastic. Not the crap you find here in the states.,3,2
"I think that this product is of decent quality, contrary to other reviews. I had no trouble working with the plastic over the dial, I was able to turn the volume up or down with ease. However, I choose to wear it upside down because it feels like my ipod would slip out when running.",3,1
"I got this cover for my daughters 4generation itouch... She picked it herself. First of all it did take a while before we got the product which drove me insane, since my daughter kept asking me everyone day when it was coming. It took roughly 10 business days, too long for a little girl. Anyhow when she got it she really liked it, but soon after she wasnt too happy. First of all it isnt strong enough to withstand a drop. Its more for looks than safety. We ended up installing a clear cover to protect her screen and that created another problem, the corners of her protective screen kept peeling off due to this cover. Its not made to be used with a screen cover. The price is great, the design is cute and trendy, but not practical for a child. I recommend something stronger for kids.",3,1
"I have four of the exact same model at work, except they come with a charger. I assumed these would have the same charger spot, since they are literally identical besides that, but they do not charge. We keep these on all day, five days a week, and we have to change the batteries basically every week. I'm disappointed that there is no charging option.",3,2
"Very compact. Tucks in nicely behind rear view mirror. Simple and functional quick detaching mount system. Very long power cord is plenty for most cars but full size trucks may be a stretch. Decent price point. Seems to do what it is supposed to. Have yet to review much of the recorded material, however. Instructions could be a bit more clear, but they help enough to get started. Trial and error fills in the rest.",3,1
I have one cap that doesn't always maintain battery contact and doesn't send the signal to the main control unit.,3,2
"Did not work for my camera on the Harley handle bar, would need an additional swivel on the bottom to get the camera level",3,2
"The case looks very nice and protects the tablet very well. But after using only a few times, the part that bends has become too flimsy and the tablet does not stand up for viewing like it should. The stylus works as it should. I am not using the screen protector so I can't comment on that.",3,1
"Display is difficult to read at night, background for display is uneven.<br />Controls are not user friendly.<br />Would be nice if it included the AM band for the radio.",3,2
"This case has already been replaced.  The kick stand is difficult to open, the case is decorative, not protective.<br />This case was purchased only to give with the itouch.",3,2
PRETTY CHEAP AND NOT VERY LOUD,3,2
"As far as reviewing the case...I love the case and it's very nice, but it did not fit my e-reader very well, even though the ad for it said it would.  It was too big and the design only has corner straps for the e-reader to fit into.  My e-reader was too small and did not stay in the straps.  I replaced it with a cover that my e-reader slides into and it works much better.  There was too much movement of my e-reader in this cover.  I do have to say however that the quality is very nice and if it's a good fit for your e-reader, you would be very happy with this case.<br /><br />As far as reviewing the Seller...I have been waiting for a refund for this item since I sent it back at the end of November.  I called the merchant and got an RMA Number per the instructions.  I sent back the case to the Seller.  The seller claimed for weeks they did not have the item back.  It went from Sacramento CA to Chino Hills, CA.  Finally, after three weeks of back and forth emails from them apologizing for the delay over and over again, On December 21, they refunded me $19.99 for the price of the item.  They did not refund the shipping nor did they refund the shipping charge, even though the item was not as described in their post.  I wrote them back only to receive another \\""I'm sorry\\"" email from them.  I got so frustrated with the entire process, I finally just disputed the charge with my credit card company, something I should have just done from the beginning.  I will never buy from their store again.",3,2
"Didn't work for my house. There's a mountain nearby and I tried to point around it, but could not get any channels. Even took the antenna up to the roof to see if I could catch a signal and I got one channel for a few seconds.  I think it's probably more a problemwith my location than with the antenna.  But you might want to test your area reception or talk to your neighbors before purchasing this.  Returned it without issues from the seller.",3,2
The case itself is very functional and seems to be worth the cost. One downside I noticed was the leg on the back used to prop nook up. It seemed to be constructed of only leather and was not very sturdy and prone to bend when any pressure was put on the face of nook. The nook I had was defective and I returned it and didn't replace it so my experience with case was limited but I did notice the stand starting to collapse while I did have it.,3,2
"I like this case as it is secure and I can hang my ipod on the neck while exercising or walking.  It is simple and functional.  The problem I have is that if I want to charge it or put it my ipod speaker, I need to take the case out completely.  It is not that convenient to take in and out.  I cannot stop wondering why didn't it have an opening for connection like most of the other cases?  Hanger can be attached in the either side of the ipod.  But functionally it works better than arm bands, which makes me sweat when I exercise.",3,1
The item is as described..... it charges my phone...... it's small not bulky and easy to manage.......  i just can't seem to get rid of the static no matter what channel i choose.......,3,2
The case looks classy but its a bit unprotected and slightly wobbly. Its a case that's more for show then a protective case.Its a okay Item!,3,1
"It measures low frequency and radio frequency emissions but doesn't tell the user which is red flagging. The instructions give target levels but not how to properly measure them. Like how many inches from the device. Also, the manufacturer could not give the source documents for the levels they measure. They need to be able to cite the reference material they use to set the limits of the device.<br /><br />Plus a press on/press off button for activation would be less cramping to the user (me) than a momentary contact. Just nit picking a little.",3,2
"Garmin:  No product registration or warranty information was received with purchase.  Poor operating instreuctions. Thus far, product functions as intended.",3,2
"For iPhone 6 and VW, Audi MMI supports only charging! No iPod functions, no music or videos, no data :-(",3,2
"Afraid to use it again.  I plugged this in to my motorcycle battery tender leads. I then plugged in a USB cigarette adapter to charge my phone.  It popped, fizzled, and fried it to a crisp seconds later.  I am going to see if I can diagnose the problem.  Quite frankly though, I am hesitant to plug anything else in to it.  UPDATE: Leads were put on backwards. I was able to use a multimeter to determine polarity was wrong. I have since cut the leads and directly connected them to my battery. Works fine now.",3,1
It worked okay.. definitely read the product information.,3,2
Not the best quality but serves the purposes. A bit short in length and width. A good substitute for a pricier M-Edge cover.,3,1
I gave speakers as s gift he loves the sound from both speakers great value for the money love love,3,1
"This Universal Roof Mast Whip Aerial Antenna Base fit the Toyota Yaris Hatchback very well, However, I had to cut the connector because it didn't match the Yaris.",3,2
"These are great earbuds with excellent quality sound but they are very fragile, I keep my electronics very well cared for but I only had my pair for a month before they fell apart.",3,1
"Sound quality is good with aux port, however, the bluetooth audio is a lot quieter than music. Have not used the sd card / usb system but the interface looks unimpressive.",3,1
The cover is good and satisfactory.  The stylus that came with this cover was not the same.  It was a red cover and we were sent a pink stylus.  Not something a man wants to use when using his tablet.  Very disappointed to not receive the correct color.  Would have been better to have sent black if red was unavailable.,3,2
"I really love the cover, however once it was opened I realized that it had some sort of mark on it, like white paint! I didn't feel like going through the hassle of sending it back, I was really disappointed only because it is on the front and very noticeable. all in all, great experience minus white paint on the front",3,2
"There are a number of 'Accessory' kits available.  I chose this one because it had all the connecting things and ipod covers; and mostly because of the ipod speaker unit.  The ipod speaker unit is a joke in my experience of it.  I only used it to listen to a radio station that I thought I would get good reception on.  Anyway, not impressive.",3,1
"Camera seems to be OK. Manual almost worthless, I have no idea how to replay what is recorded. I can't even find my manual now anyway. I now have the 'manual'. Can anyone in the English speaking world understand how to use this thing?  Now, later.  At first I thought I just needed to learn how to use this camera. Over time I have tried and tried to make this thing work. Other people have tried to help me with it. Overall, this camera has been absolutely worthless. It has done me no good whatsoever. It's heading for the trash can.",3,2
"My Garmin suction cup window mount rubber tore and would not make a vacuum. So I got one of these trek devices and was going to glue the suction cup body in it with glue, but the outward ring would not let the Garmin (Nuvi 750) tilt down to be visible. I then got a tiny block of wood about 1.5 inches square, and glued it down and then glued the holder body on top of it. It works. Kinda ugly setup, but it works. I would recommend the base with the open front, where the ring doesn't go all the way around, letting the screen tilt down to a readable position. Here's a link to the open front unit part number HDFMB-2 i.Trek V2 Open Front Heavy---[...]  Also Amazon might be cheaper than Semsons, check them both out.",3,2
"*EDIT*<br />I raised my stars because of the excellent customer service.  My 3rd unit is on the way.  I will edit again once I get it.<br /><br />I bought my oontZ and loved it.  The battary life was good and the sound was great.  Fot two weeks.  Then it stopped working.  It would not work plugged in and after a full day of charging, would not work on the battery.  Cambridge was quick (a little impersonal, but quick) to set me up for a return.  The new (rebuilt) unit arrived and again worked great through several chargings and plugged in.  For about 2 weeks then died.  Cabridge offer to provide phone trouble shooting, but I dont feel like going through that process that I feel certain will not provide any answers.  I guess that I will go shopping for another brand.  Its too bad, I did like the little beast.",3,2
I only have two minor complaints about this product:<br />(1) the bottom edge of the case covers the navigation buttons of the e-book reader... you have to slide the reader up a little in the case in order to have access to all the buttons.  Not a big deal since most navigation and page-turns are done with the touch screen.<br />(2) there is no good place on this cover to clip on a stylus.  The original stylus for my reader was lost and the after-market stylus doesn't fit in the reader.  It would have been great if this protective case had a little pocket that would fit a small stylus.,3,1
This is exactly what I was looking for...great price...poor quality. The charging slot easily became dislodged and the screw tightner does not hold well at all making this an okay easily losable mount.,3,1
"What's Hot: Lightweight design. includes case, touch sensitive page turn buttons, above-average battery life, full qwerty keyboard, dictionary, night reading, e-magazine support, SD card input, WIFI, inexpensive price<br /><br />What's Not: No cellular option (WIFI only), Color screen not comfortable for serious prolonged reading, user interface lacks more ease of use<br /><br />The Verdict: Although the literati's pros overcome the cons, the e-reader's biggest downfall is it's color screen. Although bright and great for magazine use/nigh reading, serious time consuming readers will find e-ink monochrome screens more comfortable. However, the reader is inexpensive, responsive, and worth a try if you look for extras like magazine subscriptions in your reader.",3,1
Control buttons are too hard to control and looks like if we press them it may gets break.<br /><br />The screen clarity is not good.<br /><br />Have good sound clarity.,3,1
"I sold the wrist strap because it was too small, even on the last setting. I wish it would be larger because it is one of the best on the market otherwise. It was too tight on my wrist, no wiggle room at all.",3,1
"Radio works well enough and is a good value however, the receive audio is so loud that I can't use the radio indoors. The volume is set from zero (mute) to ten and setting it at one will blow you away.",3,1
It works but not as described and anticipated..  Kind of bummed out by the 4000mAh battery pack and attaching panels.,3,1
This iPod nano holder I used to so much. It has a good band to it but the Velcro was weak.,3,1
Phone acts crazy when it is in this armband.  It is like the screen protector is touching the screen & activating items.  It's ok.,3,2
"Does an adequate job, though has several glitches.    Pros: It's very CHEAP, and is compact in size. It works with iPhone 3G!  Cons: I use this with an iPhone, and it requires that the skin be removed to fit.  Also, the frequency tuning is very touchy and its hard to get it to stop at the desired frequency.  It also gets accidentally knocked off the desired frequency easily.  Its pretty cheaply made and the connections (device to iPhone, and charger to device) are a little shaky. Even though the device does work with the iPhone, and charges it just fine, the iPhone does not recognize this and always asks if I want to put the phone in airplane mode (not a big deal in my opinion).  Overall, this is not the car kit of my dreams. But if you're looking for a cheap device that works OK and will charge an iPhone, this is it.",3,2
"I was expecting something of MUCH better quality; the swiveling ball is kinda hard so I had to oil it to make it easier to move around.<br />I kinda wish it came with a manual as well, because in order to mount the phone you have to manually stretched the right arm (no button or anything); which sort of makes it tricky when you're on the road.<br />I love the small size of it for storing, havent tried the dash mounting yet and doubt I will (because of sticky residue).<br />Another thing is if its a big or heavy phone the mount bounces a bit.",3,1
"Nothing fancy, but does its job.  Custom fits the 100 serice garmin fishfinder and protects from sun.  Not much for water protection.",3,1
"This product was what I needed at the time:  gummy-like rubber that protects from shock, at a great price!<br />It even came with a micro-fiber key chain &#34;mini suit&#34; for cleaning, and a screen protector and micro fiber cloth.  However, I do not suggest using the cloth to prep the screen for the protector: it leaves lint, which is counterproductive!<br />After about a year, the case has gotten a little loose.  And unfortunately, the pattern has been almost permanently transferred to the back of my iPod as smudges.<br />It was a great buy, but didn't hold up over a long time exactly as I would have liked.",3,1
The overall quality is mediocre at best.  Plus I tried to return it and would have had to pay something like $45.00 just to mail it.,3,2
"The case it's self is very nice and works well.  The case is in 3 parts, a top black part, the middle blue part, and a bottom black part, so it's not hard at all to put on or take off.  I would give this product 4 or 5 starts but it took forever to get to me, and by the time I got it my iPod was already scratched up a whole lot.  Then the apple logo is shown on the back and that's just going to get it scratched up more.  The tab on the back is great to prop up the iPod but from it looks like it could break very easily.  Otherwise very nice and a good color.",3,1
"Like the title says, it was a working replacement for the old flex cable. Although it was not a perfect match since the orange plastic had to be trimmed back to fit inside the iTouch case.",3,2
"I like most of the unit except the information window does not have a light and is hard to read. The CD does not have a skip to skip unliked songs, fast forward does not get the job done. My old one had these features.<br />George Bruce - Flint, MI",3,1
"I purchased this to replace the Blue H2O waterproof headphones that I used to have.  Sound is NOT as good as the Blue ones.  I bought these because they have volume control and microphone that I needed for my iphone.  These are also not under-waterproof, as Im sure the microphone outlet would take on water.  Overall ok, but if you dont need the mic I would recommend the blue headphones instead.",3,1
"This mp3 player is cool because it is so small...but because of that the battery is tiny. So although it takes 3-4 to charge, depending on the volume of music the battery life is only 30 mins to an hour. I think this mp3 player would be best for kids, but not really that good for adult use.",3,1
"Its that you can't connect a power supply to it, to continue with the camera on. It goes into a web cam or mass storage. the clip on mount wouldn't stay on",3,2
"Here is my review of this product, its a dollar deal you will get<br />a silicone case,screen protector,charger and a retractable USB<br />Price is 5 Star but I will give the product a 3 Star rating.<br />There is an issue with the silicone case it attracts dust and<br />a problem with the charger, I don't know if they send the wrong one<br />but what I received don't fit in my iPod touch 3rd gen and when I used<br />the charger with my original cable there is a power mismatch error<br />appear on my iPod. Be sure to email the buyer and ask some inquiry<br />before purchasing.",3,1
"Needs to include instructions since I'm apparently not smart enough to figure out how the strap is suppose to be attatched. Otherwise, the holster holds radio fine.",3,2
"The delivery came faster than the estimated delivery time which is rare, especially near the holidays.  The product installed as it should but it has a very hard time playing dvd's that are not store bought. Most of them do not play at all.  When using a USB stick to play movies it works fine but if you turn off the car, when you restart the car the video goes back to the dvd setting and you have to start the movie all over again which is very frustrating.  The logo on the dvd player fell off before it was installed and will not stick back on. The remote is very picky and does not work a lot of the time. The video and audio quality are good. The size is good and it swivels nicely.",3,2
Very nice case except that the elastic corners meant to hold the GPS unit do not stay on very well.,3,1
"Item works well after you get it to connect.  Sometimes it can be a real PITA to connect though, especially if you connect to multiple devices.  I've had to &#34;forget&#34; this device and reload quite a few times.  But once it connects it works.  The distance you can use it from isn't all to great, sometimes no more than 10 feet.  But if you just want to use this while you ride in a car or golf cart or something where you'll be sitting close it'll serve it's purpose.",3,1
Ok,3,1
Quick Delivery...but it only worked in the watch a couple times and now watch doesn't hold charge at all again.  I bought a new/different watch.,3,1
I purchased this but have not used as I found one that actually has the complete ipod connections included. Either way it looks new and I am sure it would work just fine. just keeping it was a spare for now.,3,1
"After 3 months of use, this iPod cover has lost quite a few crystals, but the overall appearance is still ok. The crystals have fallen out around the corners and areas of the cover that likely get the most abuse. I have to admit, my daughter throws it in her purse and gym bag, so anything that can withstand that kind of impact isn't all that bad. NOTE: This item will NOT protect the iPod from water damage.",3,1
"First impressions were good, but the add said it was 6 feet long but it was closer to 5'. Secondly, I was under the assumption that the white antenna part had adhesive on it but it only has a 1 inch piece of 3m double sided tape on the black square...<br />Overall, it works and that's all I need it to do. I wired it to the radio and stuck it in the glove box.",3,1
"This nice thick rubbery shell is nice in that it does seem to protect my iPod Touch pretty well from falls and such.  It coves the power button and volume buttons, which actually makes these a little easier to press on the 4 gen (which made an irritating design switch so the buttons are angled back and difficult to use.)<br /><br />I still, however, need to take my iPod out of its case in order to plug it into most accessories, such as a docking station/speakers.  I wish it were thinner on the bottom so that this wasn't necessary. But I guess their priority was to provide a protective shell rather than a useful one.",3,1
"the box is ok if you want moderate bass,  but if you want to crank it up the box will not hold the bass, It is prefect for what i wanted, the only problem is when they ship the box it got banged up no cushion on the corner of the box so i had to glue it when it arrived",3,2
"Eh, it's okay. Says it is for the UV-5R et al, but I had to do some carving to the case to make it fit the radio (does not fully seat) and the charger is quite rickity. Battery life is impressive though!",3,1
"Its hard to find a player that has a tape deck in it anymore. The speakers leave much to be desired, but it is a small player to begin with.",3,1
The single speaker from Music Angel (same brand) ironically sounds twice as good. I bought them both so I would know.,3,1
"I ordered several of these. Most of them seem to work just fine, but one of them stopped working after awhile.",3,2
"Cool little gadget, most fun checking what sounds best, so far my large garbage can, haha. Quality is fair, don't expect it to last real long but for what I paid, the value has been fun. Will be a hit at parties.",3,1
"I feel I could have done better in choosing a case for my $400 iPod touch. This case has a snug fit, which is good, but the bottom of the iPod is barely protected. A very thin strip of rubber, similar to a chin strap, secures the bottom edge of the iPod (where the headphones and USB cable connect). It moves out of place too easily and is flimsy. I trust the top and side edges are protected by the thin, flexible rubber case, but there is not a chance that any iPod will survive any minor impact to the bottom edge. However, the mirrored back of the touch seems adequately protected. If I had the chance to look at this case before I bought it, I definitely would not have entrusted the safety of my iPod to it. My advice: DO NOT purchase this item. No hard feelings, but it's just not worth the price nor the risk.",3,2
This charger charges the GPS with no problem BUT you can't view the directions during the charge.. That's no good for me.,3,2
Cute for girls but will not withstand rugged use by kids.  One already has come apart.,3,2
Feels like a quality piece but you will spend 2 hours trying to work thru the menus.  Same as all car dvr's. No real instructions - or ones that make sense.  Appears that it will do a fine job once I get the settings right - just don't know how long that will take..,3,1
Sound lacks Bass. It's also very very small.,3,1
It's ok,3,1
I got these for my sister and there really cute but the corner design and edges peel off? They fit good though.,3,1
"I got this for my daughter because she wanted something easier to slide into her pocket (her other case was rubbery and more bulky). This was fit the bill, but it almost seems like an anti-case..it seems to hardly be protecting her itouch at all. It looks cute, and it slides in nice, but it's cheaply made...plastic around the volume controls broke off in a couple days because it's just thin, and it's not going to be as sturdy as most cases should be for kids running around with electronics these days.",3,2
"This is a toy, for a kids, play songs one by one. And headphone don't work right. But for that price is a good mp3, and design is great.",3,1
"Very cute speaker.  Doesn't get for loud so if you plan to use it so you can hear music throughout a couple of rooms, it's not a good purchase.  But if you're getting it to use for one room, it's very cute and serves its purpose.",3,1
"Purchased this for a trip I'm currently on. Worked great on my 92 Accord, but doesn't work on my rental. A Ford Focus. Ended putting in the drink well. Better than not having a mount.",3,2
"The cat is cute as can be, but it did not work.  I had sent one of these to another family member for Christmas, and it works, but it is noisy.  This one would not work at all.",3,2
"I tried this one, and it worked pretty well but left a few bubbles. For my money the Invisible Shield by Zagg works the best because it includes front, sides, and back protection that truly is almot invisible protection for your iPOD Touch 4th Gen. The Zagg product left no bubbles and shows no signs (after a few months) of corners rising or grit deposits. No experience with any other Zagg product, but I would buy it again for any upcoming iPhone!",3,2
Black Leather... Looks great; but it's not for exercise because it will stuck up sweat and stink.,3,1
"I took over 2 months to get here from China and I ordered it well before the Xmas rush. However the antenna is much better than the stock Rubber Duck that came with my radio. The swivel feature was the main reason I I wanted this antenna. You have to keep tightening the screw on the swivel or the antenna will keep loosening up and failing over, but a  fiber washer from your local home improvement store fixes the issue. Bottom line: It was worth the 11 dollars I paid for it and it works, but not same quality as the Smiley telescoping antenna made right here in the good old USA.",3,1
"I got this for my sister for Christmas.  She loved it and it worked great for about a week and a half.  Then it just quit working.  It won't turn on in her car or any other.  Like I said, she really liked it, so I'm going to send this one back and get her another.  Hopefully the replacement will last longer!",3,1
"It's not all that, but is good.",3,1
"A perfect fit, Tab slides easily into the Case. Gives Super Protection to Tab.<br />Rated 3 for two reasons-<br />#1 It does not have any protection on the upper side of case (side with the sound output port). So it easily slips out of upper side even when tab Case is completely closed (closed-shown in profile pic).<br />#2 Its too thick for a Tab. Tab(which almost disappears)becomes very unhandy in carrying to different places (which is not the purpose of this tab). This makes me feel 'not use my Tab while traveling' most of the times.",3,1
"These speakers sound good, alright lows and nice highs and mids, They sent me the wrong size so it made a 15 min job take an hour. all in all happy with these speakers.",3,1
"I am not thrilled with this product.  I feel the price was reasonable, but I find it very difficult to adjust the light so that the whole screen is lit, and there is also quite a glare.  The high and low settings seem to be almost exactly the same, it is really hard to tell the difference. I bought a cover for the reader that advertised itself and \\""going with\\"" the light, and I finally found the little pocket at the top for the light base, so now it fits nicely.",3,1
"I wanted a low profile case to make my iPod a little less slippery and (less important) to guard against scratches. This case does both. In the month or so of light duty (no drops) that I've had it, it's shed two of it's corners. I'll post pix of the corners to the user area. Not the end of the world, but disappointing. I'm counting the days until Smallworks brings their Touch 4G Lego case ([...]) to market.",3,2
this product is a good product but had it for 4 days now and it wont charge.. but great quality and holds alot,3,1
"Impressively loud for its size, but any moderately deep tones make the speaker clip and crackle. Comes with a remote and radio antenna, the remote works perfectly, the antenna does not. A neat design, but thats about it.",3,1
"I bought this for my Nook tablet, which has exactly the same dimensions as the Color, even for the screen. The screen protector ended up to be a couple mm too big for the screen so I had to cut off a bit. Naturally this did not give it a good look. So I ended up ordering another one. And this time it does fit perfectly.",3,1
"Why are you trying to fool people with that \\""600 Watt\\"" headline? These speakers are 300 watts. you're not going to get 600 watts if you put them together you know.",3,2
"I had this case for a few months and it worked great for me, it was sturdy and all that whatnot, but the stand broke after a while and now I have to get a new one, because once it's broken you S.O.L so be gentle with it, and don't leave it around children!",3,1
"I guess I can't complain too much, since I've had it for several months but the cord just started fraying and pulling out of the transmitter. It now will only play on one frequency (which is not the one it is set on). Another problem I have had since I got it, is that if it is anywhere near anything that even resembles metal (like the metal spirals on a spiral notebook) the signal starts getting fuzzy.",3,1
"It wasn't the same quality as shown in the picture, it looks kind of s***ty in person, but it's fine at least it's hard plastic and it has saved my ip[od from a lot of hits",3,1
Not very durable but cheap does a decent job,3,1
"I was looking for a brightly covered case for my daughters ipod. This seemed to fit the bill. I bought the blue one because it looked to be very bright and pretty. In person it hardly has ANY color at all. It is barely blue, plus it is slightly too big on the ipod which is very annoying. The \\""free screen protector\\"" is also too big and doesn't fit her \\""New\\"" ipod. I wouldn't buy this again. I would give it 2 stars except that it does seem to be of nice enough quality, so far.",3,2
Well I had to purchase a card for it. And I still cannot figure out to download music onto the thing.,3,1
Does not work with all cases,3,2
No power switch,3,2
"Never actually used it as, when I got a car, I didn't had an AUX adapter on it, and after that my Zune broke down quite soon.",3,2
That it only works in areas where there are no buildings to block the signal.  I probably didn't read the details close enough.  I'm sure it's good for the hiking & hunting.  It's not exactly what I wanted for driving.,3,1
"This case fits great and I have no overlapping of controls at all, which is perfect. It fits snugly and even allows me to fit my silicon running cover/arm band over it without having to remove it first, which is awesome! BUT I ordered this in grey but it was completely crystal clear - not grey at all! You can see the ipod logo and printing through this cover, which isn't an issue for me, but the butterfly print does not cover this.",3,1
"the back part did stay on. the screen front part stayed on, the circle part stayed on, but the other one didn't stay on at all, but other then that it was a good buy if you want to protect your ipod.",3,2
"Good: The sound is impressive. To my untrained, amateur musician’s ear, a single Jam Plus is comparable to the $200 Bose SoundLink Mini that I tried. Pair two Jam Plus speakers together, and you get a big, full sound for your $80. I agree with the description at this site:<br />[...]<br /><br />Neutral: Pairing is easy but it is a little cumbersome to do very often.<br />1) Switch one speaker to L (for Left) and press the power button for 5 seconds. You hear a tone when it is on.<br />2) Switch the second speaker to R (for Right). Press the power button for 5 seconds until you hear the tone.<br />3) Wait up to 30 seconds for the two speakers to pair. You hear a short bit of music when they are paired.<br />4) On your player device (phone, tablet, etc.), pair with “Jam Plus” in Bluetooth.<br /><br />Neutral: You have to press the power button for 5 seconds to turn a speaker on or off. The power button and the L-Mono-R switch are on the bottom of the speaker.<br /><br />Neutral: The two speakers’ volumes are controlled independently. You can use your player device’s volume control to affect both speakers at once (with limited range).<br /><br />Neutral: The volume controls are a + and a – on the side of each speaker. There is also a play/pause button. I would prefer an old-fashioned roller for the volume control. Ideally, I would also like a master volume control for when the speakers are far apart.<br /><br />Bad: Two speakers paired together made a lot of static (in one room, but not in a different room).<br /><br />Bad: You can only use one speaker when connecting by wire to the Line In port. If you are listening through a phone, that means that you can’t listen to FM radio in stereo.<br /><br />I am returning these speakers because they won’t provide stereo sound for FM radio or for digital music in the room where we need it.<br /><br />My wife and I bought the Jam Plus 2 Pack for the family to replace our old, malfunctioning radio/CD player in thekitchen. We planned to play both digital media and FM radio from our phones through the speakers. I first paired the speakers to each other and to the phone. I played songs stored on my phone and liked the sound a lot except for static when playing in stereo in the kitchen.  The range of volume and fullness of sound was great, but the static affected every song.  I tried the speakers briefly in another room, and they worked well, without static. When I took them back to the kitchen counter, however, the static returned. I tried it again with only one speaker, and there was no static.<br /><br />I also tried FM radio from the phone. With a phone, FM radio won’t play over Bluetooth. (See below for the reasons.) I knew this limitation before I bought the speakers, so I connected a jumper wire from the phone’s headphone port to the speaker’s Line In port. The music played clearly (when the phone got good reception). Unfortunately, the Jam Plus cannot play over both speakers when receiving audio from the Line In port.<br /><br />Here’s why I say cell phones won’t play FM radio over Bluetooth.<br />1) Phones require headphones (or a jumper wire) to be plugged into the headphone jack to act as an antenna, even if you are playing the radio over the phone’s speaker.<br />2) If you pair the phone to a Bluetooth device, the music still plays through the phone’s speakers instead of going over Bluetooth.<br />3) I even tried switching back and forth between FM radio and digital music. The digital music plays over Bluetooth, but the FM radio comes out of the phone’s speaker.<br />4) More than one source on the Web confirmed that no cell phone will play FM radio over Bluetooth.<br />5) I know of no technical reason a phone couldn’t play FM Radio over Bluetooth. Maybe there is not enough demand for this feature.",3,2
"It has a human voice warning that give distance in centimeters. No buzzer or beep sound, just the human voice warning.",3,1
Very poor screen visualization and  great difficulty in file selection. This makes it a poor choice even though Sound is good,3,2
"On first glance this little cassette player/recorder is a bit cheap looking, but it worked like a charm to get my father's many cassettes into ITunes and bring him into the 21 century. Unfortunately, after a month of moderate use, the software now \\""hangs up,\\"" and I can no longer download what I just recorded. It says \\""Can't export. Close any active window in ITunes.\\"" I've left a message with the company, but I've not heard from them. I'll try again. If the software can be fixed, then I'll amend my review. Otherwise, I think the review will be rated to a 1 star.<br /><br />Update: I'm adding a comment on my review. It appears that the problem is the current Itunes (11.03 and above versions) and the EZ Converter software. If you have Windows XP or run on OS, you will not have the \\""hang up\\"" problems. Also, if you have not updated to the current version of ITunes, your Tape Express should work fine. Of course, I didn't know this and automatically updated my ITunes. That's when my problems occurred. I finished my taping using Audacity, which was fine since I was almost done. ION Audio is aware of the problem and says they are working on the update. In the meantime, you might NOT want to update your ITunes until you finish taping if you run on Windows Vista, Windows 7 or Windows 8.",3,1
The charger has a problem and causes overheating of the unit.,3,2
The case was fine - seemed to fit my color nook ok.  I did not like the color however - note it only comes in this color (teal).,3,2
"Its okay in the matter that is a working product. Shipped and arrived fast. Not exactly the correct size. The home button should be include, gives a challenge to put the home button. Need to put glue to hold it in stop. Overall it dose work and i do not have a broken screen now.",3,2
"I liked all the features of this product. You have to be gentle with the stand. Mine broke after about 4 months.  I had a problem with  my ipod after using the wall charger, but the people at the Apple Store said it was not the charger's fault. Nevertheless, I have not used the wall charger since.<br />The case is sturdy. The price is reasonable. It did take a while to arrive after ordering.",3,2
"I love this thermos, except I've bought this item TWICE and both times, the same thing happen. The button is not strong enough (because it's all plastic) to last longer than 2 months. The first time I bought this thermos was from Target; I thought I dropped it too many times and I broke the push button. Target didn't have this item anymore so I bought this one on Amazon, 2 months later.... and the button pops off just like last time. The bottle is AMAZING! I love having this bottle keep my tea warm for HOURS so I don't need to keep re-heating my tea to keep it warm. I can take it on the go if I'm sick and want hot tea.<br /><br />This product gets 3 stars because the product is great, but it breaks after 2 months and the warranty only last 30 days.... There goes $35 down the drain..... twice!",3,1
"What I like about this product.  1. Good protection and feel.  2. The cover has good friction,you can just leave it on the car dashboard while driving and it stays there without moving.  3. Comes with a dock so that you do not have to remove cover to charge.    What I do not like about this product.  1. Attracts a lot of dust and lint.  2. Sometimes hard to remove from trouser pockets because of the inherent friction of the skin.",3,1
"unit had a window to show how it is working, it performed better than the TopTop , , earphone are not what is showing, sold for  6 dollars , cost  3 times more for shipping, so it is the chinese crab",3,2
"I bought this to go on my Audio Technica 875r. It blocks the wind better than the standard foam windjammer that comes with the microphone, but with strong winds it's not so great. It definitely works better than a naked microphone but only with light to mild breezes, any strong winds will be heard. This windjammer fits the microphone very well. You get what you pay for, so if you're going to be working in windy situations, definitely spring for a more expensive one.",3,1
"Wasn't too crazy for this product.  Bought it for my boyfriend along with an iphone and cover.  We've tried several sheets, thinking we just put it on incorrectly, even had others try it, but the bubbles underneath just won't go away. Not sure if it's the product, or us, which is why I gave it 3 stars instead of 2.  Either way, it's way too difficult to even bother having a screen protector.",3,2
The sound is good but the way its set up its confusing im going to have to play with it a lil while to figure it out,3,1
"itseemed to take seriously FOREVER to get here, but after the long wait i am happy about this product. it works correctly and is a very sturdy and well made case. it fits my nook hd+ perfectly.",3,1
"For the price, this case is adequately well made and works fine.  But it is NOT leather, it's vinyl.  It's nicely disguised vinyl, with an outer texture that looks like leather from a distance, and a nice suede-textured layer on the inside.  But a peek under the edge of the seams reveals the tell-tale glued-on cloth backing of vinyl.",3,1
The graphics are great and really spice up the bland look of the nook but when you remove the sticker from the sheet its so sticky that it stretches and wont fit the nook perfect anymore. Other than that its fine.,3,1
"I've had this for 6 months now. When I first got it, the battery in it would last only a few days. Now it lasts me about a month between charges. It also occasionally forgets it has already been paired with my phone and I will have to re-pair it. Other than those 2 things, it works well. People have no trouble hearing me over it and I can hear them fine.",3,1
"I'm a bit dissapointed with this product. After leaving it in direct sunlight for over 20 hours, the charger capacity was still at 50%. When directly in the product details, it states 13 hrs for a FULL charge via solar. That being said, the main reason I bought this was to have a solar charger with enough Amps to charge my phones (EVO, GS3) AND tablet (Galaxy Tab 10.1), which it does. (FYI, The tab needs to be turned off to charge).<br /><br />At 50% solar charged, it will only provide about 25% battery recharge to the tablet and approx 60% to my phone.  So, granted it does work. But its unacceptable for a solar charger to not be able to charge 100% within 20 hrs of direct sun exposure.<br /><br />I followed the instructions as stated by charging 100% via USB first and that provided 100% battery to my EVO and about 25% to the tablet. I'm torn on whether or not I keep this.",3,2
it was something that i thought that i wanted but somehow it wasn't so i guess it was my mistake but don't worry i am not holding you for something that i did.,3,2
Perfect or lacing up the sensor to you shoes. It was basic packaged and exactly what I thought I would receive.,3,1
"This is a hard case, fits and protects my nano 5g perfectly, except for the fact that it does NOT cover the screen. But the real bad thing about his item is that once it's attached to the iPod, it gets REALLY difficult to unattach without breaking the case. Not practical.",3,1
IT SHOW THE SPEED BUT WANTED MILES WENT ALSO,3,2
Bought the Boombox for my grandsons birthday. When buying this it also suggested that I buy the Ninja Turtle headphone<br />that they said goes with it. Extra $12.

Everything with this purchase was right except for the cable. It quit working on me after about a week. Everything else was golden. That's the only reason I didn't bother returning anything.,3,2
Good but not the best.  It did get to me in a timely manner which was much appreciated.  Having a problem getting all the bubbles out due to stickiness isn't the best.,3,1
"The case was beautiful but the first time I got the case it broke when I took it out of the package. The company was very professional and sent me a new case which didn't break until later when I tried to take off the case,which is very difficult to take off, and pieces of the case broke off making it unusable.",3,2
"I've decided that there really isn't a good car adapter for my iPod (unless someone can prove me otherwise). I've used the Monster cable and it died after 2 years. It wasn't all that great so I decided to try something new.    This FM transmitter isn't bad, but no matter what station I set my radio to, I either get static, or a high pitched noise coming from my speakers. Plus, since my cigarette lighter is down near my stick shift, when I plug in the transmitter the numbers are upside down so it's hard to read the station number unless I tilt my head.    I do think it's easy to use and the short cable really doesn't bother me, but I think when this thing dies I'll just buy a car stereo that has an MP3 port already included in it.",3,2

"You will have a 1/8 inch gap between the radio body, and the base of the antenna when the antenna is firmly screwed down onto the radio, but the antenna works OK.",3,1
It looks good but it doesnt fit perfectly. theres a little space on the bottom where the other part sticks.,3,1
Transmits music well and charger is compatible with iPhone 5 but does not transmit music well and charge phone simultaneously. There is a lot of static whenever I try to use the charge while listening to music.,3,2
"We got the Wilson 2000 a while back for my husband semi-truck because the antenna he used was low range and he couldn't used it much.  So we got this one since we got it, its works find nice range and clear too, we are happy with it.",3,1
Battery life is short - needs to be recharged after 3 hours. They should use a lithium battery,3,2
"The MP3/4 player is very good, easy to navigate.  There are not a lot of tools and bonus features here but for the price it can't be beat.  I bought this for a 9 year old and she has not put it down in weeks.  Great for kids before they are old enough to transition to an IPOD Touch or Zune.    *Note:  Read and follow the instructions EXPLICITLY",3,1
"I agree with the reviewers who said this product makes the screen too grainy.  I had a matte screen cover for my old iPod and was prepared for a certain amount of graininess, but the distortion on this one was unacceptable and I have now removed it from my 4G.      If you primarily use your iPod Touch for music, then you may be happy with this product.  It was very easy to apply, is much better at hiding fingerprints than a clear cover, and is a decent price compared to others. But if, like me, you use your 4G mostly for applications, pictures, and video, I think you will notice a significant degradation in picture quality with this matte cover.    I am using a clear cover for now, but will consider getting the Power Support matte cover (the kind I had before) when it becomes available.",3,1
We need flash memory instead of cd for installed the program on laptop,3,1
The words just do it were a little blurry I will  hope you guys will change that in the future,3,1
"I am a great fan of Garmin plotters etc. but this Mexico chip left something to be desired. It's underwater 3D mode was fraught with problems and I was not too happy with the chart accuracy in some instances. That's in the Baja itself. I must say the Baja is poorly charted to begin with, no matter whose charts you use. I understand the Pacific side is much better on this chip, but we did not get a chance to use that section. Their inherent plotter charting software is excellent in my opinion.",3,1
"I bought this to wear while working out. Unfortunately after about twenty minutes and sweat build up it started to rub then irritate and finally I had to take it off. Not sure if it's the material or the velcro, but I ended up buying a different one that cost more, but I can wear it no matter how bad I sweat or how long I workout.",3,2
"lets your sansa stay scratch free however, the hold button and sd card slot is almost inaccessable... it also mekes a slim(ish) mp3 player very bulky.",3,1
Good product but it did not shade as well as I had expected. Although I would buy it again. THANKS,3,1
It's okay but not great.  It isn't really HD in my opinion.  Maybe it is but just not as much as I'd like.  The lights actually light up like flashlights at night and dont do much.  It's a nice little day time recorder just for kicks but nothing like some of the newer more expensive ones out there.,3,1
"The wire is ok and as described; however, there were not any instructions in the package. You NEED to get a wiring diagram for your vehicle's rear view mirror before installing this product. For my F-150, a wiring diagram is hard to find. I accidently cross wired this cable and ruined my radar detector.",3,2
"This case for our TomTom XL GPS only holds the screen, not any cords or the base that comes with the GPS unit. I would have preferred something slightly larger to contain all of the components together.",3,2
It's not bad.  It gets the job done.  It's not the sturdiest device in the world.  The headphone jack on the one I bought had a lot of static and was virtually unusable.  However it does produce very clear sound when you plug anything into the USB port.  A flash drive works perfectly.    I say if you are looking for a short term answer for a car MP3 player then go for it.  However I woulds not suggest expecting this gadget to be a long-term solution for playing MP3s in your car.,3,2
The directions to use this were difficult to follow.  I should have investigated further before purchasing.  I wish there was a person to contact for help.,3,2
"Good sound quality, paired easily, very simple to use. However, there is a very noticeable delay of audio transmission. Bought this to create a bluetooth guitar amp, but have to return because of the delay.",3,1
"At low volume it doesn't have as much bass as I had expected. The loudness setting does help with that though.<br /><br />From what I have read on the Boomboxery site, the case's internal design seems like an acoustic suspension type, which is supposed to give tight bass at high volume, but somewhat at the expense of low volume.<br /><br />No distortion problem from the 5 band equalizer, which is a relief. I bought this because it has a real equalizer, and not just presets.<br /><br />I tried a 4GB flash drive (pre-formatted to FAT32) on the USB port and played an mp3 album easily enough. All the songs were displayed, but with odd track numbers for some reason, (1, 3, 5, etc). It didn't affect playback.<br /><br />I also tried playing iTunes store music (the DRM-free type) from the flash drive, but that didn't work. It was worth a try.<br />Edit: Bluetooth works for playing iTunes store music. The Lasonic showed as \\""headphones\\"" on a Mac Mini (set the Lasonic to \\""BT\\"", and the Mac's Bluetooth prefpane to \\""on\\"" and \\""discoverable\\"").<br />The sound quality was OK, but the signal level was low (much lower on the same volume setting with Bluetooth than with local radio stations). Also there was a slight whistling noise during the quietest parts (TheLasonic was 7 feet away from the Mac and in direct line of sight). Raising the \\""preamp\\"" setting in iTunes' equalizer window (with iTunes' equalizer set to \\""flat\\"" first) helped somewhat with the signal level and made the sound much \\""fuller\\"" than before.<br /><br />In addition to 120V AC, the 931BTQ can be powered with 10 D batteries, or 15V DC via an input jack on the back of the unit. The LCD display glows orange whenever the unit is powered on, even on battery power. Not sure how, or if, that affects battery life.",3,2
"I've had this case for almost five months.... IT was alright... i mean it was on but the little window on it came off and I've lost it probably somewhere around the two month mark, so my screen really wasn't protected well. and with that missing dust still managed to weasel its way underneath (having taken it off for the first time since putting it on) I dunno. I wasn't expecting the world with this. So... i guess it boils down to i don't love it... i don't think I'd buy it again anytime soon.",3,1
The quality of the case was not quite as described. It gets the job done but it looks cheaply made. The left inside corner of the case was bent when I received the package and is now torn.,3,2
"Pros: Nice size screen, slim body, great windshield mount, nice display (reflective technology makes it easy to see in daylight), quick satellite fix<br /><br />Cons: Bluetooth unusable, voices difficult to understand (very primitive computer-generated-sounding), low speaker volume, poor battery life, MSN Direct due to become obsolete<br /><br />After having owned an old reliable TomTom One, I decided to give Garmin a shot, rather than paying to update the TomTom's maps. The GoldBox price made this 780 a fantastic price, considering its original MSRP. I have owned a handheld Garmin GPSMap60c for several years and have been satisfied with both the durability, reliable maps and excellent battery life of the 60c, so I figured I couldn't go wrong with this nuvi 780.<br /><br />Straight out of the box, the unit charged fairly quickly and was able to get a satellite fix inside my house (my handheld won't do that!). The display is nice and bright, and has great screen resolution. The windshield mount is leaps and bounds better than the TomTom One. I never felt once like the unit would fall off the windshield (as the TomTom had done many times), it's a great design that should adjust to any windshield/angle.<br /><br />There were several addresses that the 780 would not locate in its database. These were &#34;old&#34; addresses (have been there several years) that my TomTom would find. I tried different spelling and variations of the address, all to no avail. Address entry is quick and easy, and points of interest are easily located. One feature that impressed me was being able to search for POIs by name, ie: simply enter &#34;Costco&#34; and it will pull up all the Costco locations in proximity of your current location.<br /><br />Now for the disappointments:<br />Most of the voices sound like they were generated on Pentium 2 computers running Windows 95. They can be difficult to understand, a problem compounded by the unit's low speaker volume. The TomTom has much more realistic sounding voices.<br /><br />Although I was able to pair my Blackberry 8830 with the nuvi 780 via Bluetooth, I was unable to place or receive calls. I tried power cycling both the phone & the nuvi, and re-pairing; nothing worked. I suppose a call to Garmin, or possibly a firmware update may have resolved this issue, but I'm an impatient person and I want stuff to work right out of the box.<br /><br />Next, I noticed that the battery would only last less than an hour after being plugged into a 12v outlet for several hours. This was a puzzler for me considering my handheld Garmin will go for days (10 to 12 hours, anyway) on two AA alkaline batteries. My TomTom One lasted about two hours on a single charge, but if stored for longer than a couple of days without being used, would be completely discharged.<br /><br />Lastly, even though I never activated the MSN Direct feature, apparently it's going away in Feb 2011; but hey you get nine months free. MSN Direct is built in to the end of the big clumsy power cord (an odd design).<br /><br />The unusable Bluetooth and poor battery life were deal breakers. I decided to return the 780 and go with the nuvi 860, which I'm happy with so far, but also suffers from poor battery life. I wish the 860 had Bluetooth though :(",3,1
If this unit has the mini USB tip as pictured it only works for the  PWPBT60 Splash Boxes made before 2014. All newer units made since 2014 have the micro-USB jack which is the smaller flat one.,3,2
"Once you put these on there next to impossible to get off and While I was trying to take mine off. One of the Plastic Snaps on the End broke off. So now one corner of the player is slightly open to Dust. Not much, but enough to give concern in a dirty environment. Also for some strange reason there is a Hole in the back of the case in which Dust has collected on the back of the Player. So from time to time I try to blow it out.",3,2
"When you pay $40 for something, you shouldn't expect it to do anything miraculous or be made out of titanium, so to the people that are saying the body construction is cheap, stop being such a cheap a**.  If you want good quality, pay for it.<br /><br />I bought this not because it's fancy, but because If i get into an accident because some jackwagon cut me off, I have proof.  The video quality is actually pretty good.  It's 1080p as described.  You can easily read license plate numbers when stopped - and you can make them out while driving if the conditions are right.  The wide angle is great to pick up cars on either side of you as well.  The mount is SOLID.  it doesn't shake at all and has been stuck to the windshield for 5 days now.  It is also quite easy to adjust.  The viewer is good quality too - for a 2&#34; screen.  It lets you know where the camera is pointed and what it can see.  The screen saver function is useful for saving the battery as well....<br /><br />The battery, however, is horrible.  I drive 45-60 minutes to work and back each day.  The battery will last one trip, but not the return trip.  This wouldn't be too bad if it weren't for the fact that the in car charger will charge the camera, but it will NOT record while charging.  It thinks it's connected to a PC (through the USB port), so the only options are Mass storage / PC Camera.<br /><br />If the battery would last at least 3 hours, I would give this product a 5.  If you have a shorter commute or don't mind charging it 2 times a day, buy this camera.",3,2
"It came in about a week after being ordered and despite not having instructions one can still easily hook it up. The sound quality here in Miami is great even with there still being some stations on on the lower bandwidths. The cons are that the remote is garbage so you can go right ahead and throw it away or set it aside somewhere. Be prepared to change songs on your own or through a passenger. Even with the rubber grips on the plug it still will tilt over after a few turns so try positioning it to prevent it from popping out and disrupting your music.   Lastly, and a little bit of false advertising, is that the packaging claims the device also is able to use the speakers of the car to make calls if using an iPhone. This is a complete and utter lie. I attempted making several calls and none resulted with the caller's voice going over the speakers. Unless they meant incoming calls don't count on using this as a handsfree phone device.    All the negatives aside, if you plan on using this to charge your iPod, iPhone, etc. and prop it up for GPS/musical use then it does that well enough. Just avoid taking those turns too fast.",3,2
"This item fits okay, but it was hard to get it on a small item. Once I got it on, it looked okay. I enjoy the decorative design. I'm not sure I'd buy it again for a small item as it was a little hard to get onto my Sansa.",3,1
Might have been the product or might have been an off day for me. Didn't work. Ended up having to buy another one. Your results may vary.,3,2
"I love the case because its very durable and the purple is such an awesome color. Although when we received it and opened the magnetic flap, it pulled off a piece of the purple leather :(. Not a huge deal, bit you get what you pay for I guess.",3,1
"I bought this product thinking it would enable me to listen to my 2000+ song collection off my mp3 player in my car (I get bored with CDs reaaaaaaally quickly). It worked like a charm... for about a month. It just stopped one day, wouldn't turn on, didn't respond at all. I notified the company, and they were really great about it, sent me a new one at no charge, and didn't even want me to send the old one back, which I offered to do. The new one was just as great as the first one... and broke in about three months. I have no idea what causes the product to stop working that quickly. It's a great idea, I loved it while it worked, and I had no sound quality issues. But the really short life span is not worth another purchase. I hope they fix it.",3,2
"I was looking for a way to take my Sansa to the gym, and had used a belt clip with a previous MP3 player.  I bought one these cases for myself, and another for my wife.   <br /> <br />The belt clip didn't seem very robust, and on my unit the brass threaded insert (used to connect the clip to the case) fell out and rolled away to some hidden place I've still not discovered!!  Therefore, by default, I found the arm band to work just fine.  The clear screen protector works well to keep the LCD display clear and scratch-free.",3,1
too much base,3,1
They looked cool on the website by when I tryed them out they get my dizzy so I did no use the other ones GL WITH UR,3,1
The suction cup doesn't work at all but the speaker itself is pretty loud and low maintenance. A decent buy for the price.,3,2
"The case fits very snugly and was a bit difficult to snap on fully.  Now that it's on, I'll be lucky if I can get it off lol.  Luckily I love the design and it protects my ipod, which is what I wanted.  Just be sure you have the screen protector in place before you put on the case.  I may try again to remove it to add the screen protector, hopefully the case doesn't snap.",3,1
"There isn't much room for a adjustment for tiny arms, however if you have arms this works just fine.<br /> I bought it for a friend of mine as a gift, but she has very thin arms and it didn't work out for her.<br />Her lost my gain as it works out great for my iPod.",3,1
"hi! i purchased this mp3 player with the hope that it would provide me with some relaxation during my daily swim. it did until i went 2-3 laps into my swim, at which point the ear phones allowed enough  water in to drown out the  sound. which requires stopping and readjusting them so you can hear again.i no longer plan on them for swimming laps but find them invalable while doing other water exercises.the player it self has very small controls and the direction manual could use some detail improvments as well. i would purchase the player again,but only because i found a great deal on amazon and really needed to add something to my workouts.",3,1
"I bought this case for two reasons: 1) to guard my phone from scratches and falls and 2) to help the fix the antenna issue (for those who aren't aware, iPhone 4 has an issue where holding it naturally can cause the phone to quickly lose signal).    The fit is pretty good. I'm not sure what the reviewer who said the case was too big is talking about.  It's a better fit than the other case I ordered (from eBay).    What probably will be the fatal flaw for most people and the single reason why I'm using my other case instead of this one is that the hole for the camera is not big enough to take good pictures with the LED flash. Every picture I've taken using the flash has a bluish haze to it from the reflection of the flash off of the blue case.  I can upload pictures if Amazon users are interested. Pictures without the flash seem just fine.    When I first tested the antenna issue with this case, it didn't seem to help: I still lost signal when holding the case in my left hand.  Tonight, I tried it again and the signal seems to go down slightly, but not as quickly and drastically as it does when I take the case off.  The antenna issue is erratic and I think my iPhone is crazier than other iPhone 4's. I can't say for sure yet whether the antenna issue is alleviated by the case or the difference is negligible and I've just been getting weird reception with AT&T. But I decided to keep the phone.    The screen guard works pretty well.  I ruined the stickiness a little when installing it, but that's because I suck with putting these things on.  I'm not returning the case simply because I'm using the screen guard. Also, it will serve as a backup case in case the one I'm using rips or breaks.    Price: At $22.90 ($16.95 + $5.95 S&H), the price was cheaper than an Apple iPhone 4 bumper (which used to be $29, but will be free soon), but still more expensive than the bumper I bought on eBay for less than $5 (INCLUDES shipping charges).  Unlike the bumpers, however, this case protects the back of the iPhone.",3,1
The charger that came with the kit did not preform as stated. battery did not fully charge. The unit's ear device need to be more comfortable. Wire is sensitive for every day use. will need to be replaced,3,2
The docking station doesn't produce audio out through the RCA jack for iTouch 2G.  You have to spend the extra bucks on a RCA Audio/Video to IPod touch Connector Cable.  The ad implies the RCA out works for ALL iPods.  Buyer Beware,3,2
"When I brought Asus EeeePC, it didn't expect that wire which connect to the voltage converter would had design defect. After 2 years of plugging and unplugging, the plastic cover of the wire was damaged, its inner copper wire was exposed, and it lose its function for connection. It resulted disconnection when charging the computer. Therefore, I brought a set of wire to replace that damage site.  It works fine right now, but I don't know how long it will last for this one. Maybe another two years.",3,2
"The instruction are not very clear,as with so many pc devises today. Everyone assumes that we are all tech savey.",3,1
Too bad about this one.  I think the Nike armband is pretty comfortable and I guess reasonably priced.  There is one major problem however as you may have already read.  You ipod nano gets wet everytime you exercise!!  Talk about a major design flaw.  Also it is a little on the snug side.  Otherwise you can slide in your ipod easily and remove it easily.  If you're not going to exercise with it (isn't that what it's for??) maybe this is the armband for you.,3,2
"The sound is allright but the cord is only 3 feet long. Make mounting a little difficult. It all plastic too so I don't know how bad the sun will effect it, summer is here so I will see!",3,1
GOOD PRICE BUT HARD TO PROGRAM. PAINSTAKING TIME TO LIST ALL COURSES,3,1
Ok,3,1
It took me a while to get to this. I hooked the amp up and it does not work. I have contacted the seller and will see if I can get any help.,3,2
"Not bad for the price. Decent sound. The only \\""major problem\\"" was the silver colored control buttons. VERY difficult to see exactly what they control. Price was comparable to local discount stores. Check locally before you buy, easier to return locally if there is a problem.",3,2
went on great and easy. and is smooth. will prevent damage to screen. but i find them a little sticky. making it hard for your fingers to slide across the screen which u want to be able to do on a touch screen.,3,1
sound not as good as IHome speakers I had purchased earlier this year and has no jack to put two together for stereo effect,3,1
"Have to download to many times a week. It's also hard to download to my computer. But, it has a great view when reviewing the days drive.",3,1
"The existing cable i had on my stereo did not charge any of my newer iphones but it worked fine for music. Eventually the cable stopped working even for music (just due to use/age) so when i needed to replace it i was very excited to find this cable which claimed to charge all models.  I replaced the cable only to find that my 4S still didn't charge. I get an error on the display of the stereo display (ERROR-A0), music works fine, iphone doesn't charge.<br /><br />will keep the cable as i'm no worse off than before and needed a new one anyway.",3,2
"Sound is good, quality is fair but the size is a bit snall, i have expected a bit bigger bag",3,1
"all the cases look pretty cool on your ipod, but the red one almost looks pink. My favorites are the silver and black and all four of them are made of durable material. However if you have ghost armor on your ipod(or any scratch resistant plastic similar to ghost armor), then the cases kind of make it peel up a little on the front of the ipod, which is really annoying.",3,1
"Works fine, but has a terrible flaw:  Cannot jump from folder to folder!  My 16GB USB flash drive worked fine, even though manufacturer said 8GB max.",3,2
"Pros  Extra long battery life  Great sound quality  Stays in my ear even without the earhook  Small and lightweight  Speaks commands (such as power on) instead of making annoying beeping noises      Cons  Back of headset is very sharp and hurts  Hard to press the answer/end key without pushing other buttons, and if you push other buttons the answer/end key doesn't work at all.  Rubber eargel falls off really easily and LG refuses to replace it if it gets lost. LG Customer support is terrible      All in all, this would be a great headset if LG would allow for replacement parts, but they don't support their own products.",3,2
"My daughter likes purple and polka dots, so this was a no-brainer.  But, after using it, she complained that the fit is so tight, it causes the screen protector we applied to peel up on the corner.  Also, charge cable fits, but not properly without removing.  So....she's not using it. Looks cool, though.",3,1
"Looks good, works well, but unfortunately not compatible with my CD radio. It sounds very slowly and with much interference (very bad, I can not use it). The phone is compatible engages properly, but comes very slowly and with much interference. Seller OK, radio cd is probably my problem. Because it sounds very slow and lacks manual only give three stars.",3,2
"These are OK. Not great, not bad either. A little flimsy compared to some other screen guards I have used - but ok. They will serve the purpose intended. Not sure what the screens for the back of the phone are good for however - unless you don't carry the phone in a case I suppose.",3,2
"Works as intended, nothing more, nothing less. But it does seem to take much longer to charge than other car chargers I've used, but at this price it's hard to complain.",3,1
A little over a year in using these screens in the minivan now. They installed super easy!  They aren't the sharpest picture!... thats for sure...  And a little after 1 year one of them has a short where it drops the color red form the picture until you get the plug and wire in the right position.  Not bad for the price...,3,1
"I don't have any signal issues with these guys.  I have multiple devices and they have all worked well.<br /><br />I have an issue getting this to turn off, but I will take it.  I'd rather it have issues turn off than on and I'm not willing to go through the trenches for something so minor.  I do get signal, it does work and charge and connect, so like I said.... Minor.<br /><br />I also don't have random charges on my card or bank acct.  I like FP.  I will update if I run into any issues.",3,1
"I purchased this unit used for my Dodge Ram. The installation was easy and straightforward. It would have been nice if Pioneer had supported this product with actual wiring diagrams but they don't have them on their web site and don't respond with any useful information. My unit has a problem on power up. Sometimes it just doesn't power on. Usually it does but when it doesn't I can't seem to find a way to turn it on other than turning the engine off and on until it does power up. Sometimes detaching the faceplate and reattaching works although I can find no loose connections. Apparently this is not unusual from what I've been able to read on the internet. When it does work it's really a great sounding unit. Since the power problem is infrequent, I guess I'll tolerate it.",3,1
Touch screen seems like a good idea until you inadvertently change pages putting it in and out of belt clip. Gps sometimes slow to show true yardage. Sometimes it will take up to a minute to settle on actual yardage. Never had that problem with my original Garmin golf gps,3,1
"I like the looks of the product and it works for my needs.  There are a couple of things that could be improved. The top left corner strap does sometimes covers the power button. Also, when the cover is folded around to the back it would be nice if the closure snap would snap to the inside cover to keep it open when in use. It can snap to the front side of the cover to hold it open, but it's not real easy to do and the bent strap sticks out on the side. I am glad to have it to protect my Nook.",3,1
Perfect,3,1
"while this product works, it did not extend the battery life as long as I was expecting. I have upgraded the unit to use a CF card instead of the Microdrive and I should have gotten more time that way. I will try another and see how well it works.",3,1
"Apple - how about interchangeable batteries for the next iPhone? My Samsung Epix has them, and a separate charger like the Samsung Blackjack I which uses the same battery as the Epix. And improved battery power 2400 mah not 1200. My Samsung has 1800mah batteries they last for 3 days. The iPhone is used most of the time and needs more power. My Samsung always has a charged battery available, wish my iPhone did.    In all fairness I only have it 3 days and will need to follow up to this review. I gave it a 3 because of the main flaw. The power button is not recesssed in any way. I am using it with my iPone and if I keep the button facing my iPhone in an Otterman box with a rubber band to keep it from moving it usually does not turn off. But that is because the Otterman provides space between the power button and the screen. With the button on the raised surface it tends to turn itself off. As I am just testing it I was surprised that it took 8 hours to fully charge my iPhone, but did turn itself off twice for 30 minutes? It also did not show it has lost any power in charging my iPhone which is great. With the iPhone battery deep inside with no way to swap it out like my Samsung this battery may work for you. It does work well from what I saw so far. The button is really a very bad design flaw. I might try gluing something around it bit will stick to US Post Office rubber bands for now. The two USB ports will power my I phone and my portable speaker at the same time. I will report sometime down the road about actual battery life and other items that I can not post now.    I would ask anyone who has owned this item or buys it to try to post their feelings on the power button, maybe solutions. And overall time charging an Iphone and how long the product lasted them before the trash. Thanks in advance.    UPDATE 08/24/10: I used it for the second time last night. My iPhone hit 4% power at around 7:30pm. I plugged it in, used iPhone for about an hour. when I shut my iPhoneoff. I thought it would completely charge the iPhone to 100% overnight and would still have power left. I was surprised at 7:30am that my iPhone was at 58% and the Trent Battery was dead. I am recharging it now and will continue testing. I am still happy with the purchase, a little surprised at this turn, and not as impressed as with my first use.",3,1
"The cable works fine, but doesn't allow you to use the ipod interface while plugged in.  You have to do everything from the car's dashboard, which is kind of annoying.  Also, the Ipod doesn't turn off when you shut the car off, so you have to remember to turn the Ipod off as well, but I'm not sure if this is something they could do with a cable or would have to be programmed into the Ipod.  Basically, no major problems, but I think it could be better.",3,2
seems to work with my sla battery ok but time will tell.,3,1
"The case feels flimsy. I had purchased another case from UK (where these guys are)<br />on ebay and the quality was excellent !. This one is thin, does not feel like real leather but it atleast looks good. I don't expect it to last much.",3,1
"What I imaginaed getting from this machine was a portable, wet/dry vac with a scrubber and spray.  What you get is pretty much just a wet vac.  The spray option is so tedious that it saves time to just use a squirt bottle.  The scrub brush is fairly weak and only works well on fresher stains.  The worst part of the whole machine is that the \\""dry\\"" suction . . . sucks.  The suction space is so narrow that you can't suck up anything solid and when trying to use it to suck up dried spices it became clogged and useless.  The only reason that I give the dirt devil spot scrubber 3 stars is because it seemed to have good \\""wet\\"" suction.  It did a fairly good job at cleaning up dog pee on the carpet but I think that this could have been so much more if it was constructed better.  I would take a pass on this unless you have a lot of money to spend.",3,2
Case is large enough to hold the GPS and power cable but not the window mount.  Don't know if this was intended to just be an attractive case or if you are actually supposed to travel with it but it falls short of available room to carry all necessary parts.,3,2
"It worked, for about 6 months and now it has crapped out on me.  I liked this item b/c it had charging and transmitting capabilities.  I hope I can find a suitable replacement.",3,1
"FIRST THE GOOD:<br />  The battery life is OK.  I don't listen at max volume and got around 3-4 hours off a charge.<br />  The charging speed depends on the charger you use (it has nothing to do with the cable).  It charges in an hour or 2 with my nice 2 amp charger and takes much longer plugged into a laptop or standard phone charger.  This is standard for any device being charged by USB so don't blame the speaker if it takes forever to charge.<br />  The sound quality is decent.  Not a lot of bass but it's much better than the speakers that come on your cellphone and a lot louder as well.<br />  The suction cup on mine was awesome.  I stuck it to my windshield in the south Georgia heat for more than 2 weeks and it didn't fall off. (my car radio doesn't have bluetooth and I was listening to Pandora on a road trip)<br />  The volume level changes in small increments.  I have had other bluetooth audio devices that increment in large steps so you go from not quite loud enough to way too loud.  This one has small steps so it's easy to find the right audio level.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />  Definitely not &#34;Waterproof&#34; more like &#34;Water Resistant.&#34;  I purchased this for music while Kayaking.  It got splashed a little and didn't seem adversely affected, but it got dunked and started acting weird.  It kept powering on and off again.  The buttons are actually part of a rubber ring that goes all the way around the speaker.  I pulled the ring off and let it air dry and it works good as new.  It's worth the then bucks I paid but they should really change the description.<br />  The volume and track change buttons are the same buttons.  Long press for volume, short press to change tracks.  This can get annoying if you forget and tap the button trying to bump the volume up a bit (as happened to me frequently)",3,2
"I thought it'd be in newer condition, but I guess I overestimated refurbished products. Still worked fine though",3,2
"It isn't the best case because it gets scratched very easily and my broke within TWO weeks. It doesn't even stay on the iPod. It snapped off very easily, but if you are very careful with your iPod and you know you wont drop it, then you nothing to worry about.",3,2
Works okay but no big deal.,3,1
"I bought this for small spills & stains and find that it does a decent job. I do really recommend it for use in cleaning the upholstry & carpet on cars. My daughter gets car sick fairly often & this product works well in removing stains & odor. I would like to see some attatchments made for getting in to crevices. The cleaner doesn't manuver extremely well in the small confines of a car, but still does a fairly good job at getting the majority of the surfaces clean. I'd definately recommend the \\""Dirt Devil Spot Scrubber\\"" to people who want to spend the extra money to have a really clean car or to other parents of car sick kids. Otherwise I have a hard time justifing the price for the use.",3,1
"MY CASE CAME ON TIME, THE FELL OF THE CASE IS SMOOTH-ISH. ITS NOT LIKELY FOR THE IPOD  TO SLIP OUT YOUR POCKET WHEN THE CASE IS ON. I HAD THE CASE IN THE BACK POCKET OF ME JEANS AND NOW BLUE SMUDGES ARE ON THE CORNERS OF THE CASE.",3,2
I was able to use it but it is missing a spot for the transponder so now what I have is the new top of the case but I am still using the old bottom which has the key and transponder.  Not ideal but the price was right.,3,1
"The camera itself is nice, however it does mount in my 2010 VW Tiguan.  I had to design a bracket to hold it properly.",3,2
"I ordered this case and another one in anticipation of my new iPhone 4 arriving, and they both actually arrived before my iPhone.  It does not fit the iPhone 4 very well.  The other case I ordered has a very nice, snug fit but this case feels very loosely on the iPhone 4 and adds considerable bulk compared to the other one.  I give it 3 out of 5 because it does protect the phone OK, but there are better choices for sure; and I'll be using the other case I ordered ([[ASIN:B003S7RE4M Apple iPhone 4 / iPhone 4G Crystal Clear Case - Smoke]])",3,1
Received in a timely period. Adapter did not work with my Iphone 5 and Withings blood pressure monitor. The wiring in this adapter does not match what the Apple Lightning 8 Pin to 30 pin wiring is. Will use for other applications. Sometimes it would just be better to buy from the original manufacturer.,3,2
"I don't like the arm band. The velcro is double sided with the rough (hook) side against your body. There is no give at all in the band, so snugging it is difficult. That said, I had written a bad review of the product (don't know what happened to it?) and was contacted by the seller stating that I would be refunded my purchase price, which they did. It wasn't pricey to begin with, and I wasn't going to go to the trouble of returning it. It would have cost more in gas to get to the PO. Essentially I got it for free, which was cool of them. So the product itself = enh. The seller = 5 stars.",3,2
As described,3,1
"I guess you can't expect much more for $6.99 with free Prime shipping. It had gathered a little dust inside (visible, obviously), and when I removed to wipe it off, it cracked up in the corner by the camera. It's still usable, but be very careful with handling it.",3,1
"I love the mode of sound transmission - outside the ear as opposed to inside the ear canal.  I've had difficulty finding in-the-ear earphones that are not painful to wear.  The reason I gave these only a three star rating is because of the known issue my daughter experienced with one side going dead.  I repaired the plug myself, by soldering on a new plug.  When I put on the new plug, I found that the reason the green wire broke was because there was so little actual wire in the green lead - not as many conductors in it (inside there are two wires and grounds - a red and a green wire and their ground wires - you can't see them till you cut the outside black rubber).  These types of wires are made by wrapping thin metal strands around a fiber core to enable the wires to be flexible.  The red wire had much more actual wire in it, and consequently did not break. The repair was less than two dollars ($4 for two new plugs from radio shack), but if the manufacturers had knotted the wire inside the strain-relief (to take the strain off of the plug connections and transfer it to the strain relief) then this failure of the green wire probably wouldn't have happened.  But for the need to repair these earphones, I would have given them five stars.  I like the fact that other sounds can be heard outside of the earphones, and also easier for me to know my daughter has her ipod up too loud.  Kids can break anything, but now I'm confident she won't be able to \\""accidently\\"" break these...",3,1
"I give it 3 stars.. it was ok. Came fast, and everything was advertised...but... The gps voice is in such bad, broken english, not 1 street name is pronounced even closely enough to understand.. example.... Snyder Avenue = s Ni dr. Avenue. Terrible. I actually had to buy a new gps program to run instead of the one this unit comes with.",3,2
The package was actully delivered early. It installed pretty easy except I had to trim the plastic of the harness box to plug in the connectors and when i did that the box popped open and I notice thats its just one little chip. It is not worth the money it probley cost less then $15 dollars to make. I am happy I kept my factory bluetooth feature and the factory amp. The only bad thing is that it turns off my cd player when I make a call. Overall its too expensive but they are they only company that makes one so you have to get it.,3,1
"I got this because of the size. It is nicely padded but should have a harder body. It is large but, because of the padding, there isn't as much room inside as I had hoped. It protects my mp3 but is too tight for my over the ear hooks on my earbuds. A nice feature is that the zipper can be locked to keep prying hands out.  Another feature that would have been nice would be an attachment so you could fasten it to your belt loop or purse handle.",3,1
"I bought this unit to replace an aging Kenwood unit about 2 months ago and I'm still not sold on it. Here are my likes and dislikes, LIKE: Plenty of power; DISLIKE: Too many audio settings, you almost have to be an electrical engineer to make sense of them all(apparently that is a Pioneer trait). LIKE: Bluetooth works perfectly, included mic is small and fits almost anywhere. LIKE: iPod compatibility is decent, you can use the unit's readout to scroll your playlists, tracks, artists, etc...  DISLIKE: The buttons on the face of this unit are SO small you can't read the text on them (you will just have to memorize what they are for). Overall I would have preferred a more expensive touch screen Clarion model but if your like me and on a budget and need a decent double-din unit with loads of options then you \\""might\\"" be happy with this unit.",3,1
A friend gave me a leather caSE WHICH i LIKE MUCH MORE AS IT HOLDS THE DEVICE MORE SECURE.<br />I it exactly what I ordered and was cheaper.,3,1
"I just got mine today from Amazon.com.  Upon opening the sealed package, I noticed a rattle inside the inverter.     Turns out that there was a loose screw in the inside.  Other than that, the 175w easily powers my Dremel_100 (145watt) for emergency lock cutting and on the road emergencies. Connected fine to my portable booster battery's   cigarette lighter. A portable dremel comes in handy for that once in a year situation.    The plastic looks really cheap.  I won't rely on this quality for daily use.  Given the cheap plastic, I just hope this thing is fire safe.   Nevertheless, the price is right.",3,2
"Aftermarket item which is fine by me, the cable worked fine but the wall plug didn't work at all.  Considering the cost of the item and the return shipping cost along with the general hassle of returns (did not contact the vendor) I am just going to keep it since the cable is really what I needed anyway.<br />If you need both you may want to pay a bit more though I don't know if you would have better luck.",3,2

"The sound is really good, BUT I purchased this model because it is supposed to have an am/fm radio which I planned to use a lot.  No radio function is mentioned in the instructions, and if there is a radio, I can't figure out out to access it.",3,1
"Aqua Blue is the color I saw and ordered, but the actual color is more like powdered blue.  Other than that, the case snuggles nicely and the silicone is thick enough.  I decided to keep it anyway; just get a wallpaper that complements the color.",3,1
"who docks their iPods these days?  With an iPod touch or an iPhone, you can connect them to the soundlink accessory and listen to your music wirelessly over bluetooth.  Sure, the dock was useful years ago but I haven't had a non-bluetooth iPod in years.  The future is soundlink and bluetooth connection.  If I do dock my iPhone to charge, it'll be in the iPod dock that sits next to me, not next to the wave system.  The wave is on the other side of the room, I'm not going to deal with the inconvenience of having to get up to go to my iPhone to change music when I can have it right next to me.",3,2
"Purchased this pop up speaker for a Christmas gift and while the size and shape of it was nice, the sound was more tinny than I had expected.  Decided to send it back and purchase a different item.  It was intended to be used with an iPod touch and iPad to give some better external sound.  Like the concept of the speaker, but didn't care for the sound.",3,1
Bought this for a present. Sound is pretty good. It's a little on the too much bass side. After a few months that battery stopped holding a charge.,3,1
"The product itself was fine, but the company has very poor customer service. My package was lost by the post office and when I contacted the company I got no response back several times.",3,2
"Bought as a Christmas gift for my husband, he said it was okay. I never see him use the cover.",3,1
"I like the fit of this cover and magnetic closure. But the fabric looks so cheap. There is a sparkly gold outline around the flowers. But on mine there is extraneous gold on other parts, in partial shapes of the flowers. It looks as if another cover with wet gold paint was stuck on top of my cover and left some residue behind. One of the white flowers has a red smudge through it. It's disappointing. Otherwise the cover seems well constructed and I like the padded feel.",3,1
"I bought this for my niece and the moment she put it on her iTouch we realized she wouldn't be able to really use it.<br />It doesn't really protect anything... however, the art is unbelievable. Adorable. :( I was sad she wouldn't be able to use it.<br />The other day she told me she loves it but she can't put it on because she is afraid it won't protect her iTouch.<br />I guess it is fine for people that like the really really really slim type of cases.",3,1
"Needed to copy some old irreplaceable audio tapes via line out.  This did the job, then I donated it.",3,1
"I had a case from this company for my old Samsung Omina, and it was AWESOME, I'd give it a 5+ stars.  The same can't be said for their Droid X case.  The phone doesn't sit squarely in the case, the case blocks the top pull down menu, and the case partially covers the charge port.    I cut the little strap of leather below the earpiece speaker so I could easily access my pull down bar.  The charger port van still be accessed with the case on, but not easily.  And the case isn't exactly a good fit to the phone.      pros.  material quality  Build quality    cons.  fit  design    There is a similar case from a company called Fortte.  I may try theirs out",3,1
"Overall, the product is good--once it finally starts.<br /><br />It has a Kenwood/Garmin Splash Screen that shows up every time you start the car and stays on for way too long. Every time I see it, I hate Kenwood a little more.<br /><br />When I start my car, I want to hear the radio. I don't want to wait 30 seconds while Kenwood reminds me I bought a Kenwood.",3,1
"screen protector was okay quality for price.  the minisuit cleaner was cute, but not necessary because how linty can your ipod get to even use it?  the case it comes with only dirties your ipod a bit more with the small lint in it.",3,2
"The tape drive works fine.  The software is borderline.  About one third of the time the software won't recognize where one song ends and another begins, so you end up with the entire side of the tape in one file.  There is no provision for turning the tape over and continuing to record; you must begin the recording process again.  The interface for the software is not anything close to intuitive.  Once you come to grips with all this, the system works.",3,2
NOT ACCEPTING LOTS OF THINGS YOU'D WANT TO BUY AND WARRANT,3,2
"It started producing pretty loud hissing sound (like good old FM interstation noise) 10 seconds after power on. And the noise began to happen 3 days after I started using it. Power cycling the device did not fix it nor removing IPod from the dock. I perhaps used for less than 3 hours. While it worked, it produced pretty good sound.",3,2
"good, hope it could last for a while as my first one which was another brand died a few days later",3,2
"Pretty normal, does not do as well as I was led to believe, got also another GPS cover which works even better, and cleaning the dust off of GPS is not as easy as portrayed, had to stick it on and then stick it on again and again to get every piece of dust on it.",3,2
"I broke off the mast on my factory power antenna in a car wash on my 2004 Mazda Miata. I wanted something more sleek, so I decided to try a hidden antenna. This one was cheap and available for Prime shipping. The review weren't terrible.<br /><br />Initially, I plugged this directly into the back of the radio (factory Bose unit) and put the antenna in the glove box. Reception was better than my broken-off antenna but not great. I found I could take the antenna out of the glove box and hand it over the rear view mirror for slightly better reception.<br /><br />Later, when I removed the factory power antenna bits from the trunk, I moved this antenna to the trunk. Reception is a little better but still not great. There are many times when I can't seem to receive anything. If I use &#34;scan&#34; on the radio, it doesn't stop. If I manually set the frequency, I can get a signal that fades in and out.<br /><br />I'm going to try the Metra Amplified Hide Away Antenna to see if it's better.",3,2
over all a good K2000 car cam I ordered mine from Afunta-Mall they have the novatek DSC turnkey version.  Howerver the 25ft car charger adapter was defective did not charge while recording it went into a USB mass storage pc cam mode.  Used the shorter PC usb cable that came with it and pluged it into my current cell phone charger.  Works fine although the max record time is 3min it does the job fine I'm using a 16GB class 4 from PNY works good no issues yet.  FYI don't over tighten the suction cup plastic nut screws the plaster will twist off.  not bad for a 50.00 car cam there are a lot of k2000 imitations out there this one seems to be legit and records ok.,3,1
"I bought this bundle mainly for the skin and the car charger.  It didnt come with the bracelet shown, but I didnt really care about that.  The skin is nice.  It has held up nicely for several months.  The car charger, however, makes a loud hissing noise if you try to use it while listening to your mp3 player through an aux input in a car stereo.  Which is what I mainly wanted it for.  So that is kind of useless.  The house charger is fine.  Havent tried the arm band, but looks to be ok quality.",3,1
"Battery works as it should.<br />The procedure to replace it is somewhat sucky.<br />I've done several similar procedures - this one is tedious, uses the smallest screws I've ever seen, and requires close tolerance soldering. Nothing too difficult - and there is a good youtube video showing you step-by-step exactly how it's done.<br />I'm just marginally glad I didn't trash the nano.  Mehh",3,1
"Hello, as all my other few reviews I have to say I don't live in the United States, so I get my products with an additional international shipping and it's hard for me to return, so I must be very careful on what I buy thru Amazon.    I bough this cable to save few bucks from the Cablejive's DockBoss Plus alternative ([...]) which can be also found here in amazon.    If you have a Bose SoundDock system, this cable won't work as it comes, because this Speakers Detect some voltage out of the iPod/iPhone and turns on (it shuts down as soon as you pull out the iPod/iPhone) so, as it is off, it won't play the music. maybe (i didn't try it) with another docking system with an ON/OFF button would work)    in order to have it work, you need to open the 30pin side of the cable, and connect the pin 19 with the 18 (with some resistor in order to have a lower Voltage and amperage (Pin 19 have 12V @ 500mA and pin 18 expect 3V @40mA (or something like this, I found this searching the web), so I went to a electronic shop and have bought an Iron, some tin, some resistors and cable to try it) i wasn't able to put the resistances in such a short space (and I'm not that electronic welding oriented) so i just connected those pins and had it working... Just to protect my investment, I will buy the cable from cablejives which is more professionally  finished.",3,2
"Purchased to extend Square (Square-up) card reader / swiper. (also white)<br /><br /> While it functionally matches the 4-pole contact of the reader, it does not work to extend the reader signal.<br /><br />Audio (headphone) function tests fine. Microphone function not tested here.",3,2
"The watch looks pretty good,instruction book is so small,you need a magnifying glass to read it,have not yet used it,bought it because of the price,will let everyone know how it works soon",3,1
As other reviewers have noted this case is very similar to the apple case.  That similarity is the reason I bought the case.  I personally don't care for the smooth material this case is made of.  It is a smooth leather-like grained material and I find that unless I keep my screen perfectly clean all the time that it leaves a pattern on the screen.  I prefer the material that the Apple case is made of.  As far as the case itself it appears to be well made and it fits the Ipad perfectly.  All of the cutouts line up and It has a flap to secure your Ipad in the case.  The reason I gave it three stars was the marks it leaves on the screen.  That may not be an issue for you if you clean your screen each time you use your Ipad.,3,1
"Fits my Galaxy Tab 7 perfectly, great protection in my opinion, but I have to hold it with my hand if I want my tablet to stand. It doesn't matter if it's horizontal or vertical, it won't stay put for longer than a minute before it falls. Besides that, I like this cover & the color (I got navy blue).",3,1
"The cover fits really well, but is a little thin.  Overall, it is just an average cover for the ipod touch, doesn't have a lot of cushion. The armband is a nice bonus and it is ridiculously cheap!     Overall, I would recommend this if you are not looking for anything fancy.",3,1
"Works, but found it doesn't lock on station well.  And requires volume to turned way up on device and car shocking you if you forget to lower the car's volume before disconnecting.  My wife will not use it fearing it could then harm her speakers.",3,2
Case was ok. Did the job. Only thing I didn't like about it is the fact that it felt so fake. Compared to other leather cases I have seen/felt. So I tried this case: Apple iPod Touch 4G Carbon Fiber Top Flip Leather Case. It was a lot better :),3,2
too big,3,1
Great sound quality.  There is not a way to tell when the battery is low until it shuts off.  The blue Bluetooth light is extremely bright and obnoxious if you have it facing out.   Can only hold a charge for about 20 to 30 min. Not ideal for camping or hanging out in the yard.,3,2
Its good and the charges lasts  a  long time  but for some  reason I cant play it  when it is  charging .  That  could just be me .<br />It last me  for over 6  hours  and I  shut it off  so  don't know how much longer the battery would of  lasted  but I like to  charge the battery while  it  was  playing  and for  some reason I don't think  you  could do it on this<br />It  was  pretty  loud  and  nice  and  sturdy,3,1
I love this type of MP3 player it fits my needs the only problem I have with it is the headset jack it's not of sturdy construstion and cuts in and out since the day I got it.,3,1
theese Speakers mounting holes lind up but required some triming of the inner areas and cutting a hole in the AC vent pipe.. and creating a methond of stoping hot/cold air from blowing directly on the  speaker on the driver side,3,1
"You clamp these rings (magnets) on wires going to and from your electronic equipment to keep Radio Frequency (RF)signals from \\""riding\\"" these wires into your equipment causing distortion that often comes through the speakers. If you have a lot of wires, you may have to put these rings on all of them. You will also have to make sure of the size of the wires. If you don't buy the right size ring, it will not fit on bigger wires. I have a ham radio operator across the street, and I have older analog stereo equipment. I believe these magnetic rings help weed out/diminish his transmissions that end up coming out the speakers. They are not perfect, however, and perhaps only the ham operator can fully resolve the situation using special equipment to keep this from happening. The loudness of these ham voice transmissions are loud enough to damage my speakers. Notice all new TV's these days have them built right into the cord and computers too.",3,1
"It was really nice and cute while I used it. However...!    [Quality]  (-) After ~3 months of use, you could visibly see the pattern fade away  (-) The seam where you open and close it was noticeably thinning away  (-) It also came with a weird smell that eventually went away (maybe after a few weeks?)  (+) The color was vibrant and it was pretty unique  (*) I'm not sure what the material actually was - it was not plastic, it was kind of bumpy? Not sure how to describe it, but it was quite stiff.  (-) There were a few issues when taking pictures with the back camera; the case tends to show up in the photo a bit.  (+) The case was pretty protective  (+) No issues with the magnet closure    Overall, if you're looking for long-term, look elsewhere. I really did like it though.  Purchased for: $7.84    Updates: After much opening and closing, it definitely reached the end of its life after half a year",3,2
"I got this for the Itouch 4th generation 32 GB which is obviously in need of casing for protection.  It arrived within the specified time, no tracking, nothing special on the delivery.  It is comes with a film for the screen, 3X3 inch wipe, and a cover for the body.  The film fits well, easy to apply BUT there is an extra hole three quarters of an inch to the right of the front camera, irritating, either I got a defective one or they did not have the itouch itself when they made it.  The case is shiny, prevents slipping, and nice design, BUT it doesnt fit really well, like a pair of jeans one size bigger, so the edges bulge out a little, and there are bulges for the three buttons, but these bulges make it hard to press the buttons itself.  Three stars because is does protect the Itouch (except for the extra hole in the top right in front),and I did not return it because I need a temporary protection, but will replace it as soon as I find a beter one.",3,1
"lasted my ipod for about 5 months, then it started growing out of it's shape and holes grew in the top left/right corner, i liked the style and it came in about 4-5 days , the stylus did not last long, the rubber part of it eventually popped off, the flippers made it easy to hold",3,2
My 14 year old daughter loved the speakers.  They work well.  For the price they are great.<br />The sound quality is good,3,1
"Very easy to attach to the shoe, however not so easy to put the sensor inside of it. Takes a while to get the sensor inside the pouch. I would have opted for an easier way to insert the sensor since I have to change it every time I change shoes.",3,1

"Difficult to get all software installed, but worked just fine after.  Better instructions needed.",3,1
I bought 2. One worked fine. The other didn't. Waiting for replacement. It is nice and does protect the nook very well. Keys are well made. If both had arrived perfect I'd have 5 starred this.,3,1
"EDIT 2 to address the battery indicator battery life and night vision.<br />Ordered from Chinavasion.com.  Arrived quickly and was pretty self explanatory to setup.  On unboxing, the product did smell terrible, but that cleared up after airing it out.  Picture quality looks pretty good, but I can't seem to figure out how to make use of  the GPS data feature.<br /><br />Suction cup is working fine on my windshield, though like any suction cup mount the recent cold weather on the east coast made it a little difficult until the window heated up.  Easy to shift between day/night vision.  \\""Night\\"" vision is ok up close, however at any distance and absent street lighting, night vision is negligible.  Battery life is terrible, and the indicator never gives 3/3 bars.  As long as you have it plugged in to the cigarette adapter, the unit does power and power off automatically. This is a good feature.<br /><br />You will probably need to buy a micro SD card.  32 GB is working fine for me to take front and rear facing video simultaneously.  No drivers available for MAC and to be honest, I was concerned about the unmarked CD that came with the Windows drivers in russian and chinese, but most everything is plug and play these days.<br /><br />Still give it 3 stars for the day time function and the novelty of the split screen recording, but I might look for something better priced and better proven (translate: more/better ratings).",3,2
"I haven't quite figured it out.  I wanted to use this for audio books and it works, but can't figure out how to get this to play all the tracks, it misses the first tract on each disc, very disappointing at this time.  Will continue to try to figure it out",3,2
"On the one hand: it's small, it works well.    On the other hand it abuses the USB spec: 1. it requires a special \\""USB data cable\\"" (part number GR230-A2) to work in \\""wired\\"" mode. 2. it abuses the USB current spec: the manual says it says 1 amp, whereas the USB 1 spec is 0.1 amps until it's \\""configured\\"" by the host.    Regarding the cable, if you look on page 12 of the manual, you'll see that they put RS232 signals on the USB connector (not D+ and D- as the USB spec calls for).",3,2
"Same as several others,I'm adding this light to an Enduro bike to make it street legal. Came looking for the wiring info and much thanks to Garrett for providing it.

This may have worked for someone who knows more about fixing iPods than me but I could not fix mine with this. Should have taken it in to fix it but didn't.,3,2
It does not open wide enough if you have a otter box on case on your phone and will not hold phone in place,3,2
Seems difficult to snap into place and the fitment is a bit off.  Cover has a nice feel and does protect well.,3,1
"Cheaply made, but it does the trick.  We bought this for my daughter.  For all the stuff that is available, this seemed a bit overpriced, but...it happened to have the look she was wanting, so we bought it.  I think this should be priced closer to $7.99.",3,2
"Pro: $100 cost (compared to my $229 ipod classic), all 100 books are already on the device (compared to audiobooks I buy at $10 to 25 - and then spend 15 min or so downloading each CD of the 5 or 9 cds to a book), no time required downloading CDS to computer and then to an MP3 or ipod player. This is good for the old books I don't think about buying, and are books that I know or have wanted to read. you can use the earbuds from your own ipod or mp3 player, and you can plug any external speakers to this, rather than order from the mfg. standard jacks. easy to recharge - i do it after every night time usage (since i listen to it to go to sleep some times)<br /><br />Con: extremely inexpensive (i.e. cheap) plastic construction, compared to my metal-case ipod. No software included so that you can add your own audiobooks to it. You have to refer to the booklet that shows the titles of the 100 books, because when you scroll through the screen, you can only see the first 3 or 4 words of a title. Books are listed by title, not author. When you are listening, you have to keep track where you left off - for example, track 9 of chapter 8 - or something like that. I didn't understand how the other person said he could fall asleep to a book, and then take his morning walk starting where he left off. For me, you have to click the device and then it takes you to the main menu where you have to select the book and the chapter. People say it's the size of a thumb  - wow that's a big thumb! It's actually 2/3 the size of an ipod - 3\\"" x 1.5\\"" x .25\\"". ear phones were too big for my ears - so i use my ipod earbuds.<br /><br />The quality of the readers varies. As someone stated, it can be good or it can be awful, and I've listened to books that change narrators! Kind of annoying. But it's an interesting concept, so I'll keep it - and pray it lasts.... Since I bought this, I listen to this once in a while, but prefer my ipod....",3,2
"I bought this speaker because I wanted one that had good, quality sound and was portable to use with my iPhone and iPad.  Most of the reviews I'd read prior to purchase claimed that it had great sound and was pretty loud despite its size.  The generally positive reviews were accurate for the most part.  However, it just isn't loud enough for my taste.<br /><br />The sound quality is actually very good.  Very crisp, with even distribution of treble and bass.  It easily connects to your bluetooth device with no problem.  It's a good size for portability.  It's really a pretty good speaker.  The one drawback is that it's not very loud.  I previously purchased a ROKONO BASS+ mini speaker that performed similarly.  The ROKONO is much smaller but it's actually much louder than the Oontz, which is disappointing.  Bsically, it's loud enough for an enclosed space, but not ideal for providing music to your outdoor BBQ or party.  If you're looking for something with a little kick, this isn't it.  Go with a boombox.  If you're looking for a casual speaker that sounds good but won't blow your doors off, you could do worse than the Oontz.",3,1
Easy to install but also easily comes off.  I thought my nano had one but didnt noticed the protector already went off.,3,1
This item did not work for the Nook Color however after testing the charger on several other items we found it does work for the original Nook B&W.,3,2
"I was looking for a longer charging cable to use at night while my phone charges on my nightstand and this is the perfect length for that. When I received the cable, it worked great. The length is exactly what I was looking for but I disappointed in the quality. On the 4th day I plugged in my iPhone 5s and nothing. I tried about 20 times plugging it in and unplugging, different outlets, and it never would start charging. This would be a great cable because of the length and its likeness to the real apple cord but quality is an issue.",3,1
It does not fit the Garmin 760 as decribe. the case is to big and the unit moves around. other than that it is a good case.,3,1

"I like this style of MP3 player but this one kind of pisses me off.  The USB port is smaller than the original sandisk clip, the plug-in is flatter than the first version.  I wish that the company would actually standardizing those things or at least include information about which style of port the MP3s have.  The MP3 player froze once on my in the first week I owned it.  Could not even turn it off, had to wait for the battery to run out then recharge the MP3 player.  I love the extra space, I'm mainly pissed that I bought an FM transmitter for my car specifically for the SanDisk and I get a version with a stupid usb port style.",3,1

"Ordered as it was the only way to control my iPod through my steering wheel according to the Hyundai manual and dealer.  I tried using all sorts of combinations to get it to run through the stereo in my 2010 santa fe with only the AUX cable allowing for sound, but no control and I was never able to get it to charge through any other usb cable.<br /><br />Onto this cable.  It does work, but with some caveats.<br /><br />I cannot get it to work with my 3rd gen iPod Touch.  It'll play part of one song and then get's really scratchy and eventually loses connection.  Works beautifully on my 4th gen iPod nano though.  I'm hoping there's an update on someone's end that lets me use my Touch as it has the larger memory and would serve me better if I could just leave that in my car as my dedicated player.  For that reason I can't give this anything higher than just OK (3 stars).  It works, but seems to be picky with what it wants to work with.",3,2
"This is the model without the Bluetooth feature.  It is not very loud. I basically bought because the price is amazing, elsewhere in the neighborhood of $500.00 or more.  Always wanted a jukebox, it serves it purpose. You can add speakers to enhance the sound, it plays one cd at a time, you can hook up your ipod .",3,1
"I recently purchased an Ultimate One watchband for the iPod Nano.  I really wanted to like this product but there are just too many design problems with it.<br /><br />First and most important, the security of the snap-in ridge is misleading.  While the iPod isn't easy to shake out once it has been snapped in, an object on your wrist is inevitably going to bend and stretch.  If it is not constantly monitored, this will gradually loosen the hold so that one edge will peek out and any quick movement will send the Nano flying.  This happened to me within a few hours of full-time wearing.  Similarly, the fact that the Nano has exposed edges will allow it to catch on clothing or even (if you are particularly clumsy, like me) door jambs and furniture.  Again, it doesn't take much force to pop the Nano out of its flexible seat.  This happened to me last night when I pulled back my jacket to check the time, resulting in a cracked iPod screen.  Both of these problem could be fixed if there were a way to positively lock the Nano into the band rather than using friction to hold it in place.<br /><br />Another problem is that there is a notch behind the tongue, which is exactly the same length as the tongue.  This is not a major problem but it does cause the tongue to get stuck in there at inconvenient moments, which can make it difficult to fasten or adjust the strap one-handed.<br /><br />Finally, the little sliding bit of silicone that is supposed to keep the excess strap from sticking out doesn't work very well.  For design reasons that  I cannot explain there is a missing hole near the end.  This means, in practical terms, that either there will be too much strap sticking out, causing it to get caught on things and come loose, or there will be too little so that the strap naturally works loose on its own.  If this loop were a little tighter and the second to the last hole were not missing, this would work much better.<br /><br />On a positive note, I really like the perpendicular orientation, which allows easier access to the controls than other Nano watchbands.  I also like the fact that your skin does not come into contact with the metal of the iPod.  Although the waffle pattern on the back does tend to collect grime, it is fairly easy to clean.<br /><br />EDIT: At about the same time I wrote this review, I sent a similar text to Quad Mountain.  I didn't ask for a refund, but only wanted to express my concerns about the design flaws.  I received an immediate response, refunding the full purchase (excluding shipping) and a set of follow-up questions to help improve the product.  So, while I still will not be using the watchband, I give the company full props for customer service.",3,2
"This works, but the battery holds very little charge. If I use it in the morning on my drive to work, if I don't turn it off, it has discharged during the day. I finally, just bought one of those external batteries and just leave it plugged in all the time. This makes it work fine.",3,1

"I like to kayak alot. Wanted some music for the times when a 9 mile row gets a bit tedious. I'm not sure if it was interference from my cell phone, but I kept getting a weird croaking noise coming from the speaker. I'm thinking the fish probably heard it too.<br />Tested out the water proof capabilities. It was water proof, it also quit playing til I shook all the water out. The speaker is open in the back, whether or not it's actually getting water to it I can't tell without taking it apart, but water did pour out the back. All in all it was pretty loud out on the lake as my friends could hear the music too on low and it would be better if it had a way to tether just in case. I opted to putting it in my dry bag. Kinda defeated the purpose of having a waterproof speaker but it was secure.",3,2

Key fob fits perfectly but sometimes slides off slightly while in your pocket. This is not a design flaw as my key fob has a flip out key and there is no way to cover this area and still use the key.,3,1
"The price point of this model was decent, the exterior finish and look is awesome and I love the LED light.  The only reason why I am rating 3/5 stars is that this does not fit my shifter.  The kit comes with a few adapters that fit most shifters, my shifter is an exception.  I am going to find a way to make it fit.  Once it is stationary I think I will like it much more.  Also, I checked on the battery location switching should be no problem, unscrew the top manifold and replace battery.",3,1
"I got this for my wife's nook tablet since they use the same cases as the nook color units do and have the same size specifications, even thickness.  It does not cover the headphone jack on our tablet like others said it does on theirs, however here are my pro's and con's.<br /><br />Pro's<br /> -Material is better than expected for the price<br /> -Magnetic tab to keep closed<br /> -Comes with a decent screen shield<br /><br />Con's<br /> -Bottom portion looks like it is not going to last and concerns me since it seems to sag and displaces the nook.<br /> -Nook sticks out on top and around the corners, if it does get dropped there is minimal protection at best.<br /> -No speaker holes on the back to aid with sound output<br /> -Color is not as pink as it shows in the pic, more like a muted (as my wife's sister says \\""old lady\\"") pink.<br /> -Cover has only been on the nook for 3 days and is already getting dirty looking.<br /> -While it gives the appearance of being stitched all the way around to the lining it is actually glued.  We know this because it's already starting to come apart in some places.<br /><br />We will be returning this since we need a more durable case and after 3 days it is coming apart, but if you are not going to taking your nook out of the home often and just want very minimal protection it would be a good choice considering how inexpensive it is.",3,1
worked fine the 1st week of use but then a lot of static & radio inteference started coming thru during the songs from my phone i was trying to listen too. also the charger end that pluge into the cigarette lighter is very tight & difficult to get out. Would be better if it had an on & off switch at the end of the charger so you wouldn't have to take it out or put back in to go from the radio to the transmitteroff the phone.,3,2
"I bought this 1Gb waterproof MP3 player based on current product reviews from multiple websites and because it looked like the least bulky. I have been using it both inside the swimming pool and whilst doing cardio out on the gym floor.     My initial impression of this player is that it is fairly decent. So far it works most of the time. The only problem that I have had is that sometimes it will not play my music, and I have found that if I just turn it back on it functions fine. It may be occuring when the battery is on its last leg? I think that sometime down the road I will have to return it for replacement, though.     I did not like the earbuds that came with it, though. And after two uses one of the buds broke, that the other bud stopped projecting any sound. The sound quality was OK, but not great. I recently bought the AQUAPAC waterproof headphones and am very happy with them. The sound quality is pretty decent.     What I do really like about this player is that it is also shockproof as I have already dropped it a few times, and I feel that I don't have to be completely gentle with it, so that is definitely a bonus.     It works well both strapped to my arm and clipped to my gym shorts. The key functions have to take a little getting used to, it is not completely obvious how to navigate around it.     I am currently using Windows Media Player for file transfer and that is OK. Battery life is fairly decent, I charge the player only once or twice per week.",3,1
ok as expected,3,1

"This was one of the few cases I found for my new 2nd Gen zune. (Which I love, BTW). The silicon case fits perfectly. It is a little hassle cutting the protector to size. I use it to hold my zune while at the gym -and it works for that. The zune bounces around a fair bit during exercise. I'm not a jogger - if I was I think I'd dislike this case. I don't think it's very weather resistant. It does the job o.k. I will upgrade to a new case when more vendors produce them, 'though.",3,1

"For the price, this item is good. It fit both my 3G & 4 without trouble, although the hole for the headphones didn't line up properly with the 4, but it's a minor gripe since it does still work. The reason for the lower star rating is the build quality. Within a month or so the stitching came undone around the cord holder and has since completely fallen off. The stitching also holds that side of the armband to the case, so it now hangs as well. Since the armband is attached to the case at the back and the other side as well, it's still usable, but it's in need of some re-sewing at this point.",3,1
Great price and includes a screen protector. Could have fit a little snugger but works fine. Screen protector gives off no glare and was faily easy to put on worth the price.,3,1

"I received them packed in a white box. It has instructions inside, and the way is packed its nice. I received them on time.    I tested them with my computer, because they just came with a usb connection to get power. That sucks!!!. they work ok, any tipe of ipod fit in the space between the speakers. Nothing extraordinary to talk about them.    If you need speakers to use when you travel, they work with batteries so it´s ok.",3,2

"I had been waiting patiently for PVP (Personal Video Players) to arrive. Saw Archos, wasn't impressed. Creative Zen looked really good at the store, so I bought it. Have been playing with it. The video and audio play features are pretty reasonable. The speakers could be made a bit louder. The major flaw with this device is the limited ways in which u can load up the video files into it. You will need a Windows Media Center PC OR a PC with  a TV tuner/capture device to get video in acceptable formats accepted by Zen. Annoyingly it does not have video/audio inputs for capture. It has  video/audio outputs to connect it to a TV. The Windows Media Player 10, converts all files to wmv (very slowly) before syncing it with Zen. The Zen, irritatingly needs to be connected to the PC while the Windows Media Player converts the mpeg files to wmv. I am sure that there are lots of third party tools that can handle the capture/conversion rapidly, but I don't feel like investing more into this solution after spending 500 dollars on it. On the plus side, it is a very well made and polished piece of hardware. The video screen is very sharp and clear. I will probably return this and wait for the next release of Zen, or maybe wait for Apple to redo the magic they did with Ipod and hopefully they release a video version of Ipod. If you already have lots of video content already available in easily convertable format and/or own a media center pc, go ahead and buy this device. I guess I will wait around for version 2.0 of this device. Takes too much time and hassle to load up media onto this device. Creative should go with Linux and/or their own proprietary media management software. I own the Creative Zen MP3 player and the software is okay , if not excellent.  Microsoft Media Player 10 was a bad choice.    An update to the review. I have recently bought iRiver PMP-120 that is NOT based on Microsoft Media Center. There is another iRiver product model, PMC-120 that is based on Microsoft media center. Dont buy PMC-120, as U will run into same problems as the Creative product. With the iRiver PMP-120 + Pinnacle Dazzle USB Capture Card + Pinnacle Studio software + iRiver supplied DIVX codecs, I have been able to successfully capture a/v signals from my dish tv box, and then import them onto iRiver PMP-120. End Result : A portable DVR that can play captured video whenever I want. I was even able to capture HD channel outputs from my dish tv box using the A/V cables.  You will need to experiment with AVI formats and media conversion, before you get it right. The Pinnacle Dazzle capture device + software is about 60 bucks. iRiver provides all the media converter software and DIVX codecs that make it easy to import videos. Use the Portable Media Center profile, when using the iRiver DIVX codec.",3,2

"I was looking for a filter to reduce noise on my phone line. I had intended to place it in the wall and then place a phone cord into it.<br /><br />However, the jack is not for that purpose. The filter can be placed only between your handset and your phone. (In case you never noticed, the phone plug for your phone's handset is smaller than a regular phone jack.)<br /><br />The description said it is to reduce &#34;handset noise,&#34; not &#34;phone line noise&#34; so perhaps that should have been the clue to me, but since I missed it, I thought I'd write the review so others know.<br /><br />I've never had RF interference in the actual handset of my phone. The noise usually comes from the phone line itself, and (since most phones have RF filters in them) is filtered before it gets to the handset.<br /><br />So anyway, I'm a little unclear on who this item is going to help, but if you think your particular issue might be solved by a filter between your phone and your handset, maybe this is for you.",3,2

"Im going to give this product a 3 star.<br />I'm going to start by saying that this budget head unit is pretty awesome for the money you spend. It is also partly my fault that I didn't do a little more research before purchasing the product.<br /><br />Pros<br />-The bluetooth connection is awesome. Gives you the ability to listen to pandora and any other music app through your phone. When I use the mic to talk on the phone through the car, people are amazed at the quality of my voice. Im glad that this unit is so clear.<br />-You can play DVD's.....<br /><br />That's as far as I can go with the standouts.<br /><br />The issue i have for this is that, I cant really imagine many people using the DVD feature anymore, considering DVD or any kind of CD device is outdated technology, especially if you have a smart phone that you are connecting to this device. I bought this unit thinking I might be able to play youtube, and other video files on the screen. ONCE AGAIN PLAYING VIDEO/MEDIA FILES FROM YOUR SMARTPHONE CANNOT BE DONE WITH THIS UNIT! I have to capslock that statement in case people are thinking that this 2015 model unit would have that feature.<br /><br />In my defense I searched the pioneer's main website prior to purchasing to get some more details about this product. It had a little ad that showed the phone app that you can download to use with pioneer headunits. I mistakenly took that ad as a feature for this specific unit. That app does not work for this unit, unless someone can show me otherwise.<br /><br />Hope this helps a few of you guys.",3,1

"I recieved my alpatronics ax100 speaker quickly, very happy with the delivery time. My review is mostly based on comparisons with the x-miniv1.1 because thats what i have bought in the past. I was impressed with the user manual& esspecially the way the speaker was packaged. I like that the spring is strong& that it is packaged in the open position, fully extended.  Other companies have shiped a few to me closed and they never open fully.  i like that it came with the battery charged. I would prefer though, that the battery light  the other side if the cord holder so you can be sure its off without picking it up in the daylight. I like the cords. The bag was a nice touch since it doesnt have a dust cover. ).i was a little dissapointed with the sound though. I expected more sound because its so much bigger. It has great battery life and looks great but i thought i'd add that i can buy 2 smaller x- minis for around $40, they are loud and sound great, however linking them makes them less portable. Overall i think the product has great structural quality and pretty good sound quality, handles base better than the smaller speaker side by side.",3,1

"This is a true leather case, and well constructed, however there are a few problems: 1, the pocket that is made to hold credit cards and other like size things comes glued closed; I had to peel away the two layers and remove the adhesive in order to put anything in the pocket, which was a major selling point for me, and 2, the case is actually TOO thick for the iPhone 4S, and I would presume for all the Apple phones, as well as many other phones, they just don't make phones this thick anymore, so the iPhone tends to knock around inside the case, instead of being held in firmly. I don't think the phone would easily fall out because of this, but it should fit better, it's just too fat, and it don't look as good as it could if they took some width off of it. HOWEVER, for the price, you get a genuine leather case that is well made with a 360 degree belt clip that will accommodate your phone, (thicker phones will fit in it better.) it shipped quick, it's really just too thick for Apple phones and many others, and the adhesive in the pocket is quite annoying. But for the price I can recommend if you have an older, thicker phone.",3,1

"Don't expect to see license plate, face, or good IR at night.  The screen wouldn't turn on after my first use.  Called technical support and my call was returned the next day.  The Tech told me to reset it, but had no idea where the reset button is.  There is none.  He told me to put a pin through a hole next to the SD Card to reset it.  It's a through hole and there is no switch.  The instruction manual (iDrive2) download from the web refers to resetting the unit whenever it freezes, but the manual does not show where the reset button is.<br /><br />The product was poorly manufactured with thin plastic cover.  I wished there were better alternative.  I decided to keep this because it's been several weeks and it worked again when I plugged the power in the cigarette lighter.  Power button doesn't work though.  It's just on when you plug it in, it turns on.  Also, you can't recharge the battery via USB cable as described in the Instruction Manual, can't view video by plugging the USB connected to the camera and your laptop.  Must charge battery via car power (at least my unit is).  Some of the functions and features descibed on ElectroFlip do not work.

"Very disappointed! I wanted to love this speaker because the tonal qualities were excellent when it worked, but the bluetooth was very defective and the music kept cutting in and out even 3-4 feet away from my computer, no matter where I placed it and unlike other BT devices I have, for comparison purposes. I was hoping that Amazon could send me an identical replacement unit to see if this was just a bad unit, but I wasn't offered that option and instead a return label and instructions for return came up as the only option, so I guess that's that.<br />------<br />Update #1 - 5/26/15 - Aukey has agreed to send me a similar model, and I have agreed to reconsider my rating after I receive it and try out the Bluetooth performance and hope that the audio quality is as good. Stand by for followup.<br />Update #2 - 5/28/15 - I am revising my review to report that Aukey sent me their Model BT023 (see my review there) without charge and told me to keep the SK-M2 as a plug-in speaker, since the latter does have excellent sound quality when not relying on bluetooth. So in consideration of their good customer service I am revising my rating from 1 star to 3 stars. The bluetooth seems to work flawlessly on their BT023 and it is an attractive, slightly smaller, grand piano-finish unit. (See my BT023 review)<br />Update #3 - 6/1/15 - After I revised my review as fully explained in Update #2 from 1 to 3 stars, I was quite surprised to receive a further email from Aukey expressing their dissatisfaction with my revision, saying: &#34;thanks for your reply and detailed review but 1-3 star means the same &#34;negative'&#34; .it means I do nothing .<br />if you dont feel like to update it more higher,would you please kindly remove the orginal rating?&#34; I feel their request is inappropriate, as I wrote a 5 star review for the substitute product they sent me even though by their own chart it has 1/3 the playing time of the SK-M2, etc. but I feel it would be wrong to mislead buyers considering the SK-M2 since it is obvious, from all the recent negative reviews about its bluetooth function, that something has gone seriously wrong with the quality control of the SK-M2 subsequent to the original glowing reviews.it is obvious, from all the recent negative reviews about its bluetooth function, that something has gone seriously wrong with the quality control of the SK-M2 subsequent to the original glowing reviews.",3,1

"The key chain wasn't sent with the device, but the device works fine.

"The voice recorder and fm radio work for me just fine.  Need ear pieces of course (no built in speaker), either the one provided (it did not connect too well, only found a sweet spot for stereo with it not fully in) or your own (mine clicked in much better, firm connection, good stereo).    I loaded about 20 folders each with about 10 mp3s per folder. I can use the device's menu and tiny view finder to navigate to any folder or any mp3 within that folder, but selecting it does NOT result in it playing.  Instead, the operating system exits to the first mp3 in the first folder.  To get to others mp3 I have had to scroll endlessly from first to say 50th, which no one is going to do.  It then plays that mp3 and subsequent ones to the end of that folder, but does not advance to the next folder of mp3s.  I have spent ages fiddling with the menus to rectify this but have failed.  Could be just me.  The manual is little help, it is very 'lite',  mostly Chinglish and un-readable and to me seems to be for a bigger and better device (bigger screen) than the one I purchased from Amazon.  Could do with some help on this problem.    Also I suspect there is a way to update firmware, but have not found source or method yet.    Was mostly after the voice recorder feature in something small enough to become part of my pocket debris, replacing a single function memory stick, and it fits that bill, so will keep it, but if you want it first and fore-most for playing your music, you need to be better than me at figuring out the menu options.",3,1

"I've been using this receiver in my car to play music from android phone thru my car speakers. While I haven't had any problems with it functioning (so far), the 1/8” plug actually fell apart once, exposing its interior wires, while removing it from the car jack. Luckily I was able to put it back together. Bottom line is this is a pretty cheaply made device, the plastic flexes and creaks, it doesn't feel sturdy at all and I don't expect a long life from it. I'll use it as long as I can, but if you buy it, don't expect to be impressed.",3,2
"Not too bad a product. Sturdy and well put together. Proprietary audio cord is short, limiting how far apart speakers can be placed. Max volume is unimpressive.

"Decided this was the only way to cleanly wire up my car.  The auto day/night rearview mirror was dealership installed and I could not get a good splice in the tight wiring they did.  I usually go for the sunroof but that was not an option this time.  So this kit was my best solution.<br /><br />Per the advice of Mr. RG in the other review, I checked the polarity and he was correct.  The barrel plug had the red wire going to the outside.  The black wire went to the inside.  The wires were not crossed internally which would make a short.<br /><br />The wires going into the connector on my car were form-fit, so there was no way to just push these solid core wires into the gaps since there were no gaps.  My alternate solution worked much better.  Take pins and push them straight through (perpendicular) to the wire you are trying to tap into.  Pull the pin out and chase it in with the solid core wire tip before the insulation has a chance to close up.  Once the wire is through, check conductivity with a multimeter.  If all good, fold the wire over and tape it.  Repeat with the other wire.<br /><br />Done.  Not much else to say here except to always check your polarity and don't trust the instructions.<br /><br />Because extra research was required as well as triple checking all the facts, 5 stars for working, 1 star for all the time I had to spend to avoid shorting out my $$ Radar = 3 stars for the overall product.",3,1

"I got this to go along with a Pioneer head unit and Kicker KS speakers and subs for my 2000 Corvette. It claims to operate down to 1 ohms, but that appears to only be if all 4 channels are bridged in 2 channel mode. Even with two 1 ohm speakers in series on a bridged side it still would not run stable. I finally had to install resisters in line with the speakers to get them up to 4 ohms and ditch the bridging scheme. It gave me a couple hickups after that but has been stable since. Lots of power for the money and now the system sounds fantastic. Armed with a little more info I would have had a stable system from the get-go.    Update, it should have worked as originally configured. Turns out I've got a bad amp and it died on a road trip shortly after I posted my review.

Works well to design and intent.  Recorded image is excellent and provides wide view.  Instruction manual is useless.  Translation is nonsensical.  Provides absolutely no information as to the color code of LED indicator light.  Trial and error to successfully set up.  Worth the effort.,3,1
"The case is now stretched a little larger near the charging area, and because of this it keeps falling off. It was somewhat loose when I first received it but for the money you spend I guess it's good.",3,2
Cana't use it without a small &#34;card&#34; -- not mentioned in sale.  Clock works fine but video won't work without card.,3,1
"Received my Navigation and it didn't work, I contacted seller and come to find out I had ordered the wrong one. So after that was clarified The correct navigation DVD was sent and It works great!! Despite all the hassle I would buy it again",3,1
It is the same looking as a price ((((... but feets and works for me good. I think it will not work as much as I want... so still think - not too bad!,3,2
more pictures of the product would have been nice. product did arrive a day ahead of schedule. the belt clip has to be put on upside down in order for headphones to fit ipod. lanard is long enough to wear as a nicklace though while working so it's a decent buy. my mom seems pleased. good protection i think.,3,1
This screen protector definitely does what it sets out to do: protect the screen of the Kindle. My only complaint is that the anti-glare feature seems to cause videos I try to view appear fuzzy and not as clear in focus as I would like. Next time I buy a protective film I think I will try one without the anti-glare feature.,3,1
relatively easy to configure and had decent sound.  Where I was fooled was by all the ratings posts that state this stereo had excellent bass and volume.  Neither is true.  I have another stereo for my old iphone 4 which was the same price and produces WAY better sound.,3,1
first of all i wanted one set and ended up paying for two and secondly the headphones are cheap and dont work part of the time the plugin addapter was very useful tho but for the 79 $ it cost me i expected a much higher quality of products,3,2
"It beats no antenna at all, but not by much.",3,2
Charges well but touch screen becomes unresponsive when connected to this brand of cable.,3,1
"Great for a cheaply priced BT speaker, ok for a mid-priced one, bad for a high priced one!<br /><br />Decent speaker for music at lower volumes, great speaker for spoken podcasts, movies, and audiobooks. Very portable, long lasting battery. Looks good. No carrying case.",3,1
Its OK for the price. I put a 16gb card in it and it work nicely. I hate the part when the lights wont shut off even if its bright outside.,3,2
"I happened across this item in a search for wolf-themed items for my new car, and thought the price was right. Basically, it is.    These are a great decorative item - but functionally useless. Do not plan to actually USE them.    The installation was a bit of a pain - part of that can be blamed on the design of my Fusion's seats. However, two out of four grommets on the two covers failed and ripped clean out just trying to attach the seat covers.    I'm not sure what the material is, but it seems to be some sort of foam-backed synthetic fiber... neoprene, maybe? I have no idea. In any case, the seam between the seat and back parts of the cover failed blatantly after less than a month of use, and I'm not hard on my vehicle or its accessories. The incredibly quick failure of this item makes it very disappointing, and the reason for giving it only three stars. Again - great as a decorative piece, functionally useless.    Also, for anyone wondering - No, you're not supposed to use a seat cover on seats like that of a Ford Fusion - the seats have airbags built in, and a seat cover will mess with the deployment of the safety device. However, the Fusion is made of tin; if I'm ever hit in the side by anyone, I'm a goner anyhow.",3,2
"Was able to connect to my IS-F however, after connection that's when it falls on it's face since it takes for ever to communicate.",3,2
"It plays music , but do anything else.",3,2
"Good travel clock, folds up nicely, is easy enough to figure out, set, and use. The beep is sufficient to wake me up, although I'm not a super heavy or light sleeper. The only down side I've found is that it doesn't take normal batteries, it's got one of those flat circular ones, which can be hard to find when you are traveling around! All in all though I'm quite satisfied with it.",3,1
"A very nice idea. The things is that it does not hold a charge for more than a day or two. So of limited value to me.  If it held charge for at least a week or two or longer, then WOW, I would love it.",3,1
Connects and holds bluetooth well; good battery life. Sound quality not great.,3,1
works okay only good at about three feet. Battery okay so far.,3,1
"Nice item, well made, and good price, but did not fit my remote chip for the 1999 Honda Accord EX.",3,1
I tried unsuccessfully for weeks to get it to work with my Z4 (2008 E86) until I soldered pins 7 and 8 together.,3,2
Not bad for the money. Its difficult to find a case with a clip but is difficult to get nano out and in case and can't charge while in case.,3,2
"Just a quick note.  I purchased this item in the beginning of the year (2010) and have used it very happily with my ipod touch.  The battery is actually a blackberry battery so if it ever dies, it would be easy to replace.  Problem is, now I've upgraded my iOS from 3 to 4 on the ipod so I can do multi-tasking and the ipod says the backup charger is no longer compatible.  Perhaps that's Apple attempt to block non Apple devices from supporting their products, but regardless, it doesn't work any more.  I wrote to the company and they don't have a workaround.  They say the only option is to go back to iOS 3 which of course is not an option.  So the point is, this unit will not work on iOS 4!",3,2
"I purchased this alarm for my 2005 Yamaha Zuma 50, and it does work, the key was able to be cut to fit my Zuma with no problems. The problem I have with this alarm is that it runs the battery dead pretty quick. It ruined my new $40 battery by running it completely flat while the bike was sitting with the alarm disarmed. If you are going to buy this alarm; I suggest running a separate power wire so it can be disconnected when the bike is not in operation for long periods. I do electrical for a living and have for 20 years so I know it is connected correctly. The problem is that these cheap Chinese alarms all have this problem. The alarm brain does say Yamaha on it even though it is in no way a Yamaha (or Yamaha authorized) product. The connections were all fairly simple even with the poor Chinglish instructions.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Cheap Price<br />Integrated key in the remote<br />Two remotes included (1 with key 1 without)<br />Loud siren<br /><br />Cons:<br />Build quality is marginal<br />Runs battery dead if your bike sits about 2 to 3 weeks on a scooter battery (may be longer on a bike with larger battery)<br />Instructions are poor",3,2
"pros:  battery lasts a lot (around 6 to 8 hrs on first use)  bluetooth pairing is effortless  sound is somewhat decent    cons  it may have 2 3w drives though it seems it can only deliver 3w of output power, or so it says on the device (this was the main reason I bought this, so it was a big bummer)  the touch controls have been an annoyance to me since every time I move it I end up changing a song or going to phone speaker or something  I dont like the voice that speaks every time you pair the phone, a beep or something would be better  bass is weak but I was not expecting that much from such small drives    overall, decent for the money, but may consider one of the smaller speakers since they deliver almost the same sound, due to the  drive size, the sound falls on the treble side",3,2
"This is a fragile unit. I can say that \\""please do not counterclockwise adjustment when you test the module in the case of high input voltage will be damaged or even damaged!\\"" is very true.<br /><br />Thing is - what constitutes high input voltage? They don't say. 5 or 6? Popped. What's a low enough input voltage, that will still properly energize the unit, to then set the output voltage? So that you can then switch to your desired input voltage (without destroying the unit) ? They don't say. From other reviewers say - they didn't pop theirs. But maybe they're used to \\""walking up\\"" these fragile chinese units?<br /><br />All I can say is this is pretty fragile as well as under-specified wrt proper setup procedures.<br /><br />Before you ding me on this as \\""they told you so\\"" consider the exact work flow I went through on my lab bench.",3,2
"The compass on the end of the flashlight fell off after I took the flashlight out of the shipping package!  I tried to pop it back in, but that doesn't work.  Because of it, the charging portion is left exposed.  At least the light works.  :/",3,2
It's okay for the amount of money that was spent. You get what you pay for. It gets the job done.,3,1
My daughter loved it when she put it on!<br />A tiny hairline crack appeared.<br />A little flimsy Could be a little better quality.,3,1
They last for some time...but if you take them too many time off the ipod then you risk tearing it...,3,2
I've had a few of these.  I usually wear them out after a year.  This one functions fine.  It doesn't feel as sturdy as some of the others but it was also less expensive.  My first two runs with it have been fine and it seems to work as advertised.,3,1
Fits but the etching of the butterfly doesn't look very good at all.  Very cheaply done.  I would not purchase again.,3,2
"My granddaughter who is 5, has had fun playing with these.  She has already lost interest in them after just a couple of months.",3,1
I purchased this item in February of this year. It worked fine for a few months but the casset player stopped working. The motor does not run that works the casset. The reason I purchased this item was for the casset player.,3,2
"As I've said in a previous rating, this cover was sufficient until I &#34;discovered&#34; the i-Blason Smart Cover.  Still own this Smart Cover (and since I gave away the iPad 4 this cover went with the iPad 4).  For future purchases, if the i-Blason maintains the same type of clear cover, I will not be buying Boxwave.",3,2
It is ok<br />The box cant handle the bass,3,2
used it a few times it's ok sounds kind of scratchy don't use it very often mostly just the charger. bluetooth headphones work much better. listen to pandora all the time when driving.,3,1
"Easy to charge, easy to hook up and takes up little space in carry on for recharging during long flights.  Just have to remember to charge the unit itself before traveling.",3,1
"These didn't last super long - after a few months, our phones stopped working with them. Prior to that, they started charging slower and slower. But they are so cheap that they still pretty much did what they needed to.",3,1
When the case is on it does not fit on our BOSE charger to charge or play back.  It did not fit well off either.,3,2
"You do get value for $10 with this set - two chargers and two device socks. Some notes before you order:    . The two \\""socks\\"" will not fully cover an iPhone 3g - they are slightly different sizes, both shorter than an iPhone. One is about an inch short, the other is about 1/2\\"" short. Perhaps they were designed for the smaller iPod Nano device. The seller stated this short-fit was intentional by design, to ease extracting the device from the sock, however this was not apparent from the description or the product photo, and I had expected it to cover and protect my whole device.     . The wall charger I received had a loose prong and did not work. The seller replaced the component at no charge, so the DOA issue was resolved. The low price point may reflect the product being less robust or less well tested than more expensive units.    . Now that the wall charger is working, it charges the iPhone very quickly, much faster than the Apple charger that came with the iPhone. The power indicator LED is a superbright blue, almost like a flashlight.    . The car charger works ok. The coiled flex cord is made of plastic that is too stiff to let it stretch beyond the resting length of 18\\"" without strong recoil. I am curious to see how well it endures time and heat exposure in the car, or if it will become brittle (too early to tell).",3,2
"This CD/Radio player has really nice sound & quality for the size, Wow, surprised! *However, the style/look is different than in the picture..Speakers are long & narrow extending around the side. No silver as shown, black with a rounded handle & a more flat unit. Radio controls are hard to get to, under the back, with rolling channel dial. The look is not as nice, Thank God the sound is good! :)",3,1
I really like this case a lot. I'm a huge BMTH fan and really wanted the case. The price is too high for the quality. It looks like it's a hard case with a sticker on it. I also had to wait forever for it to be back in stock. It was suppose to take about three months to ship but it only took two months which was very fast.,3,1
"Motorola MotoACTV Clip<br /><br />This clip does not look very sturdy, and has a very small opening so it only clips onto thin objects or clothing. It's also difficult to remove the MotoACTV from the clip once it locks into place.<br /><br />Overall: 3/5 stars, not really worth the price mainly because the clip feels flimsy and the opening is way too small. Even my old iPod shuffle had a larger clip opening but at least that was made out of aluminum.",3,1
"Kind of a cheap zipper on the case that's difficult to close all the way, but the case itself provides good padding and protection for the Garmin.",3,1
"It is listed as leather, I doubt that it is...It seems like plastic to me, but it serves the purpose. I enjoy the color and the pocket inside.<br />To sum up, I am satisfied with this purchase and I would recommend it to a friend.",3,1
"I have had this product delivered to Florida and I will not be back there until October 2010. The box remains unopened for now. Hence, no rating on this item. I see that to review as requested, I have to rate, so I am choosing the \\""OK\\"" for now.",3,2
Cute case protects well. But its one time use. Once you put it on you can't take it off without breaking the tabs.,3,1
"Works ok after you figure it out. Had trouble synching until I figured out that the supplied data cable was defective. Luckily I found one at the house that fit, and it works fine now. Touch screen is not very sensative, but not a bad value for the money. I just expected it to be a little better for the reviews I read but I'm not really dissapointed. My ten year old will like it. Owners manual is not much help, but you can figure it out.",3,2
"Bluetooth doesn't work with my galaxy tab pro, galaxy s5, or my boyfriend's iphone. Sound is good and so is battery life, so still giving 3 stars.",3,2
"I just received the handset from the third party seller DollarRite. It arrived on time, but the handset box had been opened, the handset has scratches on it and the AC plug was sloppily re-wrapped. The handset was obviously used and re-packaged, which was very disapponting since I was purchasing a product listed as NEW. I have yet to hook it up and make sure it works properly since I am waiting for the base station from a different seller.",3,1
"The speaker is OK, sounds good but feels and looks cheap. The overall construction knocked it down from 4 to 3 stars. Like I said if you want one to try out this is a GOOD one to get started with. If you want quality pop for the more expensive ones.",3,1
"I should have known better than to buy a white case. I thought it looked cool but it stained from keeping it in the pocket of my jeans and I can't get it clean again. Oh well, at least it was cheap.",3,2
It's a big help but didn't stick as well as I hoped.  I have used super glue and that works!,3,1
This product is pretty good. Its not for a big mess or area but works okay to remove smaller stains immediately.,3,1
"So far the product itself seems okay.  However, there is some buzzing when we run it through the fm stero.  My main issue with this product is that they advertise that is has a built in tv-tuner, and this was the deciding factor in our purchase.  If it does indeed have the tuner as described (there is nothing that on the box or in the accompanying manual, and I could not find anything that would indicate it as a feature on the remote or the system panel) I could not figure out how to operate it.  When I called the seller, I was told that it had an analog tuner and that I would not be able to pick up stations any longer on it since there has been a switch to hd broadcasting.  If this is so, then why advertise that feature or more to the point why not describe it as an analog tv tuner.",3,1
"it is more difficult to use compared to the Garmin brand.  Negative is it has the speaker on the back so it's difficult to hear, and the attachment on the back is not that great.  Anyhow, it's just an ok product.",3,2
I bought this because the size said it would fit in a can am commander xt and I wanted to bluetooth function but unfortunately it required some cutting on the part of the can am dash but after I did that it so far seems to work fine with exclusion that it so tightly waterproof in order to push a button it feels like you need to hit with a hammer the u_s_b port is nice also seems to be a very good spot for water to get in the same for the auxiliary port otherwise heat dissipation works well sound quality is good,3,1
"This unit DOES NOT have built-in HD radio...Says in the title that it does, but the KDR-540 does not.  Search the model number",3,2
"Was happy with the fit.  Matched my original for a 2003 Cadillac CTS.  After about a month, the white lettering is coming off.",3,1
"I only give this 3 star because the sound quality is not equal to the green speaker that I ordered at the exact same time as this one. This speaker arrived one day later from a totally different disttibutor than my green speaker. This speaker is not as clear as the green speaker and the bass is not very deep. I tried making adjustments to my device but it just did not compare. The overall performance of the speaker is ok but I think this particular speaker is defective from its  distributor. I would have been more pleased if I would have received them both at the same time from the first vendor. They were ordered at the same time. Long story short, I use it only as a speaker phone. I do recommend this speaker for its price and speaker phone use only.",3,2
Before ordering this box make sure the subs will fit.  The cut out is only 9 1/8 inches so not all 10&#34; subs will fit. The first subs I purchased would not fit.  And there is no way to increase the cut out size,3,2
"This aftermarket fuel pump will save you about $50 over OEM part, but it will not be the same. This fuel pump is loud, and makes a clicking noise as it opens and closes its regulator valve. The clicking is quite loud. Granted, it has been installed for only one week, and MAY go away, but then again it may not.  If I would have had a review to judge by, I probably would have opted for the OEM part, paid the extra $50 for a quiet fuel pump.  Both work, you decide.",3,2
"Sounds good. The only complaint I have is that the cable is extremely short - like, maybe 3 or 4 inches. Not long enough for the speaker to sit on top of my computer tower while plugged in... but also not long enough for it to sit next to the tower. It just sort of dangles. Right now it's sort of lying upside-down on a pile of books next to the tower. Pretty inconvenient. Also it doesn't really get as loud as I expected, but for my purposes it works just fine.",3,1
"Good sound for the price.  I have to remove the otter box every time I dock it.  When using the music feature from my ipod dock, the clock messes up.  I blason's customer service was excellent 5/5 in taking care of the dilemma I experienced with this product!!!!",3,1
"I purchased this case for the color as I wanted to find an orange case for my iPod Touch. The case is nice, thick enough to last a long time and protects the iPod Touch back well. It also comes with a decent screen protector that is actually designed for the iPod Touch 4G, with holes for the camera and button. The issue I have with the case it the raised green button. While it's great for finding the button while not looking, I also find it causes the button to be pressed when it's in my bag or pants pocket. If it's pushed twice the play button appears on the screen and it causes the iPod to start playing music. I always thought only skin could activate the touch screen, but having music start playing randomly as many times as I have leads me to believe it's possible that my bag/pants can cause the play button to trigger. Personally, I still like the case and will use it occasionally, but I need a case without the raised button to carry my iPod around with me all the time.",3,1
"This snap case for the 5th generation iPod Nano is somewhat ok for protecting your iPod. Biggest shortcoming is the opening for the LCD screen. Which the Amazon listing photo shows to be a solid panel with only the opening for the click wheel. The item that I received is obviously something different. There is a hole on the front panel for the LCD screen, rendering the LCD unprotected from scratches and the elements. You would required a LCD protector film to make this item somewhat functional.    This snap case is in the semi-disposable category. Since you can only enap and unsnap a limited number of times before the snaps become wore out, as with any snap case.",3,2
"I bought this on clearance sale at Kohls for a $30, so the price was definitely right! But I don't live very close to any city so I picked up ZERO channels with the antenna it came with.  I then switched to another indoor antenna that I had on hand, and managed to pickup (after much fine tuning of the antenna)all the Allentown, PA channels but no other channels (like Philadelphia, New York or Wilkes Barre) would come in.  At that time, I subscribed to DIRECTV but they didn't carry all the Allentown channels, so I could use this portable TV if desperate to see what was on the channels that DIRECTV didn't carry.       And now for the MAIN PROBLEM:  The battery when freshly charged will last less than 2 hours.  If you don't use the TV for a week or more, any charge you had in it is gone.  IT DOES NOT HOLD A CHARGE in other words. The battery is built in so you cannot replace it with a better battery.        IN THE END I decided it was better suited to be a second screen in a vehicle.  In other words, we already had a portable DVD player attached to one headrest and now we attached this TV to another headrest(velcro is a wonderful thing!) and connected it to the DVD player with A/V cords, and now the 2 kids can watch the same movie at the same time.          PROS:  Comes with 12V cord (for vehicle) and you can turn up the SOUND very loud (with no distortion) so that you can hear very well over the road noise. Have had no problems so far with the picture or the remote control. However, it has been used only lightly up to this point.  Time will tell.          CONS:  Built-in Battery....don't depend on it.  It simply doesn't hold a charge.   Reception...........Must live IN a city in order to pick up some channels with the antenna it came with.",3,2
"This product works just as specified, I am very satisfied with it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a well crafted item",3,1
not the best mic system but not the worst. this cost half as much as others so that was why it was appealing to me.   it was out of the box and set up to use rather quickly though.  there is a some buzz feedback at times and the range isn't huge. but it does work for short range/indoor situations and can put out a clear nice sound.,3,2
"The camera takes nice pictures and is easy to setup.<br />The night vision consists of a very bright incandescent lamp that is of no value.<br />It will reflect light off the windshield back onto the camera. It is so bright that it will illuminate the entire front<br />passenger area. Luckily in can be disabled.<br />The one really bad feature is the suction cup mount.<br />It only adjusts up and down. That means that if it is not mounted in the center of the windshield then it will not<br />be level. I personally hate to have something in the middle area of my windshield, plus I believe it is<br />illegal in most states to mount a camera there. It is not small enough to mount behind the rear view mirror.",3,1
"The feel in hand is amazingly good. Nice weigh, doesn't feel cheap. The little white corners (supposed to look like headlight?) look a little cheesy but not too bad at all. The reassembly is a little tricky. There is a spring that pops out when you open the case to add your remote guts. Don't loose it. It can be put back together, with a little patience. I put the spring in position and rotated the case to get the tension I needed to make the key rotate out again.<br /><br />My only issue is that while the key blank DOES fit my 2010 Toyota Tundra, my remote guts will NOT fit inside this case. So I now have a flip spare key but without keyless entry. I would suspect this case might work with remotes like my dads 1999 4Runner had. But not the 3button rounded teardrop remote my truck has. Maybe this supplier will point me to a different product that my remote guts will fit into. I would buy another, the quality is that good and the cost is too low to justify returning this one since the blank fits.",3,2
"Player is fine, but it doesn't have a headphone jack.  That is a deal breaker for me.",3,1
"The Mp3 has a good size and it works. The sound quality is fine but the menu is a little difficult to handle and after two months of use, the earbuds got broken. New ones cost as much as the Mp3 and where I live are pretty hard to find... I cannot use it anymore.",3,1
not as strong as I would hope for it to be.<br />the price is great and I really can't complain,3,1
"this case broke within a month. It was attractive and got a lot of compliments, but is made with cheap plastic. The price was also cheap, so no great loss.",3,2
"I can't really give this thing a fair review, since I haven't been able to get it to work with my 120GB classic Ipod that we purchased from Costco a few years back.",3,1
"I use this at the gym and it is sometimes difficult to access the click wheel through the window. On the plus side, it fits my arm well, and keeps the ipod dry.",3,1
ITS A STICKER! i wasnt paying attention to the description. i thought it was a case. still not a bad product though...,3,2
"The small size is great and the features are wonderfull.  The FM transmitter picks up stations better than any other receiver I have had.  I use it mainly for running and love it.  One draw back is that the joy stick for the controls isn't well designed.  If you are not careful, it will break off.  The one I own is my second one because of the joy stick breaking on the first.  I've had the second one for about eight months and the volume control doesn't work anymore.",3,1
"Once you drop it, the clear part starts cracking and breaking and chipping away. I love the way that it looks though. It's very cute and looks just like the picture.",3,1
Works ok. Difficult to get back open to put in the battery. Sound quality is just ok. But a good buy to walk and listen to your favorite radio station,3,1
"Yeah, not too happy with this.  It's difficult to deal with and the sound isn't great.  Not really recommended",3,1
"speakers are a little flimsy, but for the price, well worth it...",3,1
To be fair this was a gift so it's not something I use personally. I did however look at it when it got to my house to make sure that it didn't look too cheaply made to give as a gift. I decided that it was good enough and would probably even buy one for my self (If I needed another book light).,3,2
"Great cover, but it broke after about 2 weeks of use",3,2
It works fine as designed.<br />Some directions would have made the installation much easier,3,1
"A very nice hard case which fits teh 4.3&#34; nuvi well.  However, there is no room to store the DC power cord or any dash attachments.  I wish I had figured that out before ordering.  I will now order a larger soft bag to put everything in.",3,1
The transmittter is awesome and the sound is perfect. The remote doesn't work to well and the charger. Has a short in the cord.,3,1
It is ok I use it every day controller didn't work but seller was great to deal with they took care of me...,3,1
OK,3,1
"All I can say is you get what you pay for. I wasn't paying attention. The MP4 player was *Misrepresented* as a *V POD NANO*. My *assumtion* was V for Video. The owners Manual is in broken english. I learned more playing with it. I have Only had it 2 weeks. After figuring things out, Almost perfect.     I unfortunately lost the software/driver due to my own neglegance and so far, they have been very accomodating. I couldn't ask for better customer service. I'm not pleased with the Misrepresentation, Red Tags response was V-POD NANO(LIKE) 3 weeks later, still being advertised as a V-POD NANO. I am pleased with the unit and the E-mail customer support.",3,1
The iJet remote worked well but I had not realized that it would block the headphone jack on my iPod Touch (3rd gen). I had to return it as my primary purpose for buying it was to use it while riding my motorcycle. I ordered the iJet Nav which had the same functionality but did not block the headphone jack. Overall the iJet products are well made and function as advertised. A little better description would help to save on returns.,3,2
"It's cool, but nothing I would recommend since the whole navigating process is too complicated for no reason. I kept reading the directions for a way to view my whole music list, but it was that, PLAY FROM THE TOP AND KEEP PRESSING NEXT UNTIL YOU REACH THE SONG YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. Now imagine having at least 300 songs in it and trying to get to a song that is like the 150th song in your list, what a drag. Well, hanging onto it for now, until then.",3,2
"I got this a while ago when I got my ipod and have been using it for some time now. The color is great, the texture of it is great, it just doesnt stay on well. I had the screen gaurd on and it worked fine, but as soon as I put the case on, the edges would come undone on it because its very rubbery. When i would put the top corners back on, it would peel the sides of the screen protector up (so that didnt last very long).<br /><br />If you dont plan on using a screen protector, then this product is pretty good. If you do plan on using a screen protector, than it would be better to buy a case that isnt as rubbery becasue it can be quite frustrating always having the protector peel up every time the top corners of the case flop off.",3,1
"Got this case for my daughters iPod.  It is a good case and seems to be something that will protect the iPod very well.  But as far as using the iPod while it's in the case, that's where it could improved.  The case is a little thick preventing easy use.  Also, the case prevent the iPod's auto adjust feature for the difference in lighting.  Other then that it is a good case for the price and if protection is your main priority then this is a great case.",3,1
"It works great if you use it carefully. Understand this wont wake up your neighbors, but it will shake the inside of your car. Remember, the gain knob isn't a volume knob. I only have mine at about 1/4 power. Any more than that and it doesnt sound good.    The other day we were messing with it and we tried to bounce sand on it. a think a little got inside the sub and screwed with it, so I plan on getting a new sub, but not because it was a bad product, I was just stupid with it.",3,1
It broke the second week i used it,3,2
"This case is not for the Nano 5th generation.  The case, when closed, has a cut out for the audio out cable so you can listen to music with the case closed.  The case I got had the opening on the wrong side.  This means that you cannot close the case and play music.  Once you open the flap, then you can plug in the cable.  I believe the 4th generation Nano had the plug on the opposite side from the 5th generation Nano.  No big deal for me since I won't be using the iPod with the case closed; just need something small and snug to protect the iPod.  For that purpose, it works great.  Don't get it if you have a 5G Nano and you want to listen to music with the case closed.",3,1
"I bought the MVIX a couple of months ago.  Although the unit has worked fine, it DOES NOT play MP4 files as indicated in the documentation.  As a result I have had to convert ALL of my video files from MP4 to DivX, as one of the formats supported.     The documentation is a poor translation of what seems to be Korean language.",3,2
"This was a decent arm band, but it started peeling apart after about 6 months of use.  I am still using it despite that, but if you want an arm band that holds up for the long haul, this probably isn't it.",3,2

"Cables: good quality. sound comes through clear.    USB Charger: kinda weak.  it seems to be charging my phone, but it's doing it veeeery slooowly, as compared to charging it off a regular wallplug.  maybe it'll charge it faster if you're not using it, say, to the play the music you wanna hear through it in the first place.     Signal strength: sometimes it's great, sometimes there's some static the whole time. if you slow down or speed up and you got a low volume, you can hear some static/whizzing along with that. I use 93.5 in las vegas, it doesn't have any neighbor stations +/- .2 spaces.  i tried the international mode to tune in to 87.9, but i think it's worse. it actually randomly turns off in that mode (maybe that'll work in your city/town).     you know, i just realized, if we didn't have wireless signals shooting ALL OVER THE PLACE from ALL KINDS of electronics EVERYWHERE, the signal quality might be better.  i mean, we bombard ourselves with so much wireless signals, there's this little thing trying to compete with it all.  but i suppose they're supposed to be built to compete with it all, right?      OVERALL, i'm ok with it. i bought a used one off here (amazon) in good condition, satisfied with purchase. the charger's not as effective as i was assuming it would be, and the static bugs me sometimes, but it seems like most 15-30$ transmitters have the same kinda signal quality, and i don't wanna spend 40+ on one. happy i can listen to my mp3 player in the car.    (if you're willing to spend $50-70 extra, you can just buy a new car stereo with auxiliary cable!)",3,1

"Setting up the software is a nightmare, but once it is working - it works, for the most part.    Pros:   * No monthly fee's for GPS  - it's all free.  * Alternative to CAR PC system (Windows CE-based SOC)    Cons:  * From time to time, the GPS software gets lost.  Probably due to the provided map information being outdated.  It will update errors in the map with the corrections.  These updates are not permanent, which is annoying.    * Remote would have benefited with a phone-format key input for text and numbers instead of directional keys - which seem clunky and slow.",3,2
"I have bought several kinds of ground wire in the 8 gauge range lately and have been disapointed with most of it. They put so much coating on it that it looks like 8 gauge, but has the same internal wire thickness as a good 10 gauge. Other than that the wire does what it is supposed to.",3,1
"The splash Masque Clear Screen for the iphone is well-reviewed and many of the reviews mention the difficulty installing this product.  I tried the steamy bathroom trick that one of the reviewers mentioned as well and what I found was that it did seem to work as long as you were still incredibly diligent in cleaning the iPhone screen (and not just with the supplied microfiber cloth, but also with lens or eyeglass cleaner).  I too am glad that they there are three masks included, because the first one was pure practice.  The other problem that I encountered was that at least for the Verizon iPhone, the mask is slightly too long.  It seemed that no matter how I placed it, there was just enough extra length hanging over either on the top or bottom resulting in the mask not laying on the screen, but on the edge of the case. Because of this, it wouldn't adhere at the two bottom corners.  For my second attempt, I trimmed a thin strip off the bottom before putting it on. That worked much better, but it's still not adhered slightly at the two bottom corners...I don't think I quite trimmed enough.  Similar to other reviews, I also found that you had to be very careful when putting the phone back into a case so as not to lift the mask (probably in my case because it wasn't adhered well at the bottom corners.  As far as bubbles, except for the two non-adherent corners, I have no bubbles...you just have to clean very well and remove all dust particles.  The back mask went on very easily and without problems for me.  My second front mask has been on the phone for about 2 weeks now and had heavy use.  It has performed well, although it needs very frequent cleaning.  It seems to accumulate skin oils much more than an uncovered screen.  But, it cleans well with a microfiber cloth and some spray lens cleaner (spray the cloth, not the screen).  The video that was supplied on the Amazon product page is worse than misleading and in my mind should be removed.  It shows simply plopping the mask down flat on the screen...something that is a recipe for failure and not at all what is described in the product instructions.  Bottom line, it works but is difficult to install.",3,2
"I can't read the directions because they are written in pigeon English.  I will have to ask someone to help me use this product.  It might be wonderful, but I don't know that as of this writing.",3,1
"Pros and Cons<br /><br />Pros: Unit is small (about 3/4\\"" tall and 4\\"" wide)<br />  Wiring is simple<br />  Relatively inexpensive (though should still be cheaper)<br />  Easy to install/mount<br />  Dim LED's can be removed and replaced with higher quality LED's relatively easily<br /><br />Cons: Horribly dim LED's<br />  Cheap, cheap, cheap plastic all the way around (I live in Arizona and the heat has already warped one of the garbage plastic mounting brackets<br />  Should be less expensive...even though the price is relatively inexpensive.<br />  Fake chrome \\""coating\\"" over plastic easily wears off (I taped off the lens and spray painted it black...much less tacky looking)<br /><br />All in all, you might as well go to \\""Insert Big Box Store Name Here\\"" and buy the same thing for less. And don't expect this to light up the roadway! Hardly worthy of having the word \\""Safety\\"" in the product name. I have LED flashlights that have less bulbs and are far, far brighter! This would be better used as an under-dash lighting kit if I were to do it all over. Save your money",3,2
"I think the case is super adorable, but the gems are not well glued on and they fall off very easy. The case does not protect your screen at all, which kinda sucks. But a good thing about this case was the shipping, it came in the mail in about four days. Other than that this case was not a good buy. :(",3,1
I bought this case because I liked the color and it came with a car charger. The case is a smooth harder cover. It comes with a reflective smooth cover that I have on it right now. I think I'll take it off its really hard to see the screen when it keeps reflecting my face. The pink is just like the picture.  I used the plug in for the wall to try it out...and it charged it but as it charged my itouch was freaking when I went on it. It's a bit cheap. I will not use that charger for it again. I do like the idea of the car charger. I haven't used it yet. It's in my car right now.    The product is ok. Good for the price. The case is pretty though.,3,1
I DIDN'T CARE FOR THIS ARMBAND AS MUCH IT DIDN'T HAVE A SNAP TO HOLD THE IPOD AN FOR ME SECURITY IS IMPORTANT FOR PROTECTING YOUR PURCHASES!!!!!!!!,3,1
"First I'll start with what I like about the case. I was glad that the color and the rest of the case's appearance exactly matched the picture, as that is not always the case with products on Amazon. Also, the case, that comes in three parts, fits securely and does not come loose.<br /><br />Now for the things I didn't like. As several other buyers have mentioned, the kick-stand is very low quality. It's very hard to open up and once you do manage to get it out, the hinge is very flimsy. It hardly seems fit to hold the weight of an iPod. Also, the rubberized texture of the case gets dirty VERY quickly. The middle piece is easy to wipe off because it's smooth but the white top and bottom pieces are not to easy to clean because they are ridged.<br /><br />Overall, the pros and cons are just about even. It's an affordable mediocre-quality case that does about half of what it is meant to do.",3,1
"Bought it for my husband and the only thing I didnt like was that they forget to tell you that you need a auxillary to connect the system to a radio.  All they say is if you an FM radio is all that is needed, all fm radios do not have an auxiliary to it, that disappointed my husband as well as me so now he has to buy a new stereo in order to use it in his car.",3,1
Purdy darn small,3,1
It is a 24 pack of the same 4 packs 6 times. It did not tell me this before I bought it. That is the only thing I do not like about this product. It is a waste of money unless used for a class room type setting.,3,2
"The good points (which are really just what one would expect): The sound is fine, installation is exactly as easy/difficult as any other DIN car radio.  USB works fine for what I want (a thumb drive plugged into the back of the radio).<br /><br />The interface is *terrible*.  I also have a Pioneer a few years older in another car, and the face looks basically the same, one big \\""multi-function\\"" knob and some small buttons off to the left.  On the older unit, you can press the knob on the edges to skip tracks/albums (left/right for tracks, up/down for albums).  The knob on this unit is only one button, so if you want next/previous album, you need to fish around wherever in the car you've put the external remote, which is the only way to access that feature.  Just hope you didn't take the last corner quickly, because now it's under the passenger seat.<br /><br />It feels like a lame attempt at cost reduction which makes the radio much worse.  I'd have given it 5 stars if it had the old-style knob.",3,1
"Works for my iphone4s, but it does take a lot longer to charge my phone.<br />Normally my charger will charge my phone to 100% in 2 hours, this one does not !<br />does a good job replicating the original, but don't be fooled ! its not !<br />The usb did not want to completely connect with the wall piece but it still worked.",3,2
"I like the fact that these screen protectors are anti-glare, however, the screen protector makes an annoy &#34;swishing&#34; noise when you swipe the screen.",3,1
"Pros: Its small, easy to use, inexpensive, durable, can clip it to a stand, and has nice variety of beats as well as the click isn't too annoying. The display is also nice with both a light and hand movement.    Cons: It doesn't turn up very loud and it goes through watch batteries very quickly. I don't know about you, but #2032 watch batteries aren't normally sitting around (not like 9v or AA) and even on lowest volume it goes through one every couple of months with daily use. I put sound through powered speaker system (or headphones) so the batteries don't get used too quicky and I can hear it. If you didn't, I suspect you'd eat batteries very quickly. Nothing like practicing with your band to the metronome and it suddenly dies and no batteries available.     If I had to do it over again, I'd go for the DB 60 (uses AA) or 90 (uses 9v or ac power) or look at the yamaha. In fact, I'm shopping for a db 90 now as I write this...",3,2

"Over the last few weeks we received several different smart watches from various sellers and have had time to test them all out and compare the results. We have had this particular smart watch for several week now, really trying to get to know it well. I am not a wristwatch wearer, never have been, so I enlisted our 16 year old son in the testing and review of its functionality.<br /><br />His finding are that this smart watch is very basic as compared to others he tried. He had no trouble syncing it with his Samsung Galaxy S3 and setting time, date and alarm. He had no trouble getting notification that calls were coming in, but that is about it. The volume that the speaker on this watch produces, and maybe the quality of the speaker used, makes it very difficult to hear and understand what the caller is saying. Therefore, instead of being able to keep the phone in his pocket and use the watch to communicate, he had to dig the phone out and use it.<br /><br />As a watch, this unit works fine though it is a bit larger than the watch he typically wears. As a device to improve the efficiency of his electronic communications, or to play music transmitted from his phone, other smart phones in the same price range had better performance.<br /><br />Sample provided for testing and review",3,1
"This is an okay case for the ipod. It seems a little bit flimsy and scratches very easily ( but at least it's not my ipod getting scratched). I guess for the price, I can't really complain too much though cause it does provide protection, though I now cannot use the wrist strap.",3,2

"This is a very reasonably priced product and I was looking forward to receiving it. However, once I got it and tried to put it on, two drawbacks became immediately apparent and cost this item 2 stars off the rating.   1) The armband portion is not elastic, it's a velcro strap, and it's not long enough to strap around my upper arm. It'll go on the lower arm but then the ear buds will be pretty strung out and probably snag on things when I'm working out my arms or even riding a bike. An adult-sized version would be nice.  2) The IPod is inserted through a flap on the inside of the armband and the outside of the armband is covered with plastic. To reach the control pad on the front, you have to remove the armband and open the velcro flap, extract the IPod, make your volume or playlist change, then stick it back in and put the armband on. Not convenient, at all. You might be able to cut a hole in the front but unless you can cut a perfect circle, it's going to look crappy.  In short, this product works if you have small arms and you never need to make changes during your workout.",3,2

"For me, these cables are a double-edged sword.    The price is tough to beat at almost any level of quality. And, although I was skeptical at first, I did not have the dreaded \\""incompatible device\\"" error with these cables on any of my iDevices (an error which is common among low quality knockoffs -- and even a Griffin power adapter I recently purchased). They feel like they're a decent quality, with a good weight and strong enough connections.    However, these are NOT Apple OEM cables, as was described when I bought these last week (although then they were sold by The OEM Shop, not WOWparts). They were only packaged with a clear plastic band with no branding, and a quick comparison with an authentic cable blows the rest of their cover. The branding on the cable itself wears off, the USB and dock connector logos are different, and there is discoloration.    That's not to say that these cables don't work -- they do just fine. But be aware that they are most likely not going to be actual Apple OEM products.",3,1
"The cable feels much higher quality than other cheap cables available on Amazon, and worked perfectly--charging from both sides and connecting to the computer--for the first few days. After about a week, however, I connected my phone to my computer and my computer did not recognize that anything was being charged. Now, it works on and off, but without any sort of consistency. I'm a little disappointed just because it was working so well in the beginning and I really was happy to have the long cable.",3,1
"I picked up a PRS-600 at Target when they were clearanced because Sony announced a new model (the 650) and because Target was beginning to carry the Kindle.    The first unit I got wouldn't charge correctly. The battery inside the unit ended up swelling (very, very bad for a lithium battery) so I had to exchange that unit for a new one.  The replacement, after charging for 4 hours, works great and does exactly what I wanted as far as the interface goes.  I can take notes on the book, and make drawings and notes for myself and my kids.  The screen is a little too reflective, and the contrast leaves a little to be desired, but I expected those issues when I bought it.  Many reviews refer to these issues, so I won't go into them here.  The PRS-650 is supposed to address those because of the change to the \\""Pearl\\"" e-ink system.    What I've found nearly unacceptable is the battery life.  I've been drooling over e-ink technology for almost ten years, patiently waiting, specifically because I wanted a reader.  The thing I always liked about the idea is the idea of no battery usage except to change the page.  This is *not* the case for the PRS-600.  Because of the resistive touch-screen and whatever it's doing inside it's little processor head, it is constantly using the battery.  The only way to reduce battery usage is to turn it definitively off (which is not the same as just sliding the switch over, which puts the unit into sleep mode).    I have yet to get more than 4 days out of a charge, and I've never gotten through a full book without needing at least three charges (due to time constraints, I usually take just over a week to read a 200ish page book, which is about 400 \\""turns\\"" on the reader).  I've had the unit for about two months and read several books on it, but I still just can't decide if it's worth the charging hassle.  Unless you leave it charging and/or powered *off*, the book will rarely be ready for you to just pick up and take with you.    This isn't a malfunction.  The battery is \\""within spec\\"" for Sony, because if I were to, in one session, do nothing but change pages, I'm sure I'd get thousands of page \\""turns\\"". If, however, I spread that out over a couple of days (as in real world usage), I might get a couple of hundred.    I've got an external charger (a barrel plug 5.2 volt charger), which does not come with the unit (the only charging method out of the box is via USB).  When charging with USB you can not use the unit, but when charging with the barrel plug charger, you will be able to use it normally while charging.    The MP3 functionality is slightly less than adequate, but I don't use it.  The interface for MP3 files is laughable, if you want it for anything other than listening to one or two songs.  It doesn't keep your place if the unit reindexes (if you turn it off, or if you plug it into the computer), so it isn't usable for podcasts or audiobooks.  That's okay, I have other gadgets for this, but I just want to make it clear in case anyone thinks they'll be able to replace their music player.    Overall, I suggest you decide if you want or need the note and touchscreen functions (I do, or I would have returned it within a couple of weeks).  If not, I would say go with another unit.  If you do, be prepared to deal with the battery issues.",3,2
"(...)  Day 1: All excited I plug it in my 'puter load it up with songs & comedy, walk the dog....it cut's out. Restart, doesn't leave me where I left off (some Lewis Black rant).

I would recommend people to get the case.. but dont expect anything good from the rest.",3,1
"Either I got a used/aged battery, or they are all like this, but with my Zaurus SL-5000 it loses all charge in just several hours of standby/off mode (that is, the device is just lying there turned off and still the battery dies in a few hours!). Haven't used it much for any real work, so can't tell how long does the device last while actually running. Anyway, don't expect your Zaurus to have a battery life of an iPad with this one.  The screen that's included doesn't fit well and is prone to coming off. But then, it's supposed to be a freebie, so what would you expect?",3,1
"Just a heads up for others.  I just bought a Raymarine a series bundle with Gold Navionics charts for $100.00 more than the no charts model.  I now find out that the bundle lake charts are from 2006, the other charts are 2013 and there is a $99.00 upgrade fee to current. That is $199.00 now for the the charts I could have bought separately for $165.00.  What kind of company allows their partners to sell their trademarked cards with old data? They do not tell you that the bundle Gold card is not the same as a \\""real\\"" Navionics Gold card with a one year upgrade period.",3,1
"It would be great if it held charge longer than an 1hr. It works great. it just won't hold charge long , even if its not being used.",3,1
"Fits perfectly and looks nice, but is hard to remove.  Would also be better if it had a clear portion to protect the screen, instead of just framing it.",3,1
"The case was of questionable quality, but the arm band and hard plastic screen protector left much to be desired.  On the upside, I have dropped my Zen several times and the case kept it safe.",3,1
Enjoy it but froze up in cold. Good sound and price.,3,1
"These earbuds make a lot of noise on the outside, so people sitting next to the person wearing them hear everything they hear. But, for the price, they are decent.",3,1
excellent thank you very much,3,1
"Some of the items were missing in the packaging.  I asked to have the missing components shipped but that was not possible, so I returned for a full refund.  I would rather have had the replacement parts than the hassle of the return process.  So just giving average rating.",3,2
Nice sound in a small package. Good price.,3,1

"Yes, I bought ten, but unfortunately three of the ten are not working and I already dispose them.",3,2
"I needed another cable for my new iphone 5C, the price was good.  I Have to move the connection to insure it fits in the iphone.",3,1
"I suppose this did alright, being the only mount that really seems to fit my Magellan Triton.  It still jiggles a bit when I'm biking, and I can't get it totally tight, but it holds the GPS very well, so I know it won't fall out, and it's very easy to get the GPS in and out of the holder.",3,1
"I bought one of these for myself and my son. He is in love with his, and I am in like with mine. It is good for my needs, however, it is hard to adjust the volume which I really did not like at all. The sound is good, and it was easy for me to sync my music from my desk top to it. I just wish it were slightly more user friendly.",3,1
"You get with this, one screen saver.  No dust free screen wipes are included, you have to find your own.  Instructions are clear and to the point.  Installation is easy, I had a few bubbles at the edges.<br /><br />The whole process took under a minute.<br /><br />I am a little annoyed that no screen wipes are included because it took me a lot more time to find something to clean the screen that didn't leave residue or filaments behind than it did to actually apply the screen saver.<br /><br />This is the only screen protection I have ever purchased that didn't come with something included.  That is why I only gave it 3 stars.  It's not like it was any cheaper than other screen savers.",3,1
Pretty good for the size.,3,1
"Prompt delivery.<br /><br />Instructions are impossible to read without magnifying glass.  Some remant Chineese in instructions.  Display is also difficult to read because of size and limited back lighting.  Functions OK, but random play is limited to within directories.  Root directory is limited because of FAT format.  Easy download of MP3s.",3,2
"The cover is exactly as described.  You do have to turn it properly to close it so that the iPad 'sleeps'--this is not a big deal.  I am a little disappointed in the weight, but I think I've been so used to a magnetic cover that I have to get used to the new feel of this one.",3,1
"you want to make this product better: leave room, or add a white space next to each KEY on the control to know which car you are looking for.  If I have 4 cars, I don't know what color always matches -- especially if the keys are lost!",3,1
"I have used it intermittently for the 12 months I've had it. You can read while charging and the font size options is nice and necessary. The reason I bought it was to be able to read PDF formatted books and local library books. I do miss some books in other formats.<br />HOWEVER, since June, I have had problems with the eReader freezing up. At first I thought it was because the book was huge. Today I didn't get past page 107 of a regular sized book and it will not unfreeze, turn off etc. I believe it is cooked. Rather expensive reading during the last year.",3,1
the bluetooth doesn't work.. and it doesn't read video from usb.<br />the gps and the iPod works great,3,1
After 3 days of having the cord the plastic around the cord to the plugs are detaching and breaking. I will have to buy a new one soon because the wires will soon be exposed and rip. Must be a faulty cord. Product however was shipping and arrived way before the date that said it would arrive and that was great!!!,3,2
"Not a magnet like described. Other than that, it works on my Apple TV just fine. Very, very small. Even smaller than the silver remote.",3,1
"I just got this and have not used it but inserted it in and out of my iPhone multiple times. Right off the bat I noticed that it fit so tightly I almost had to force it in. I mean I have use unusual pressure to get this thing on and off.<br /><br />I have owned an iPod touch, iPod nano, iPad and now an iPhone. This use of pressure is not normal. It does go in and fits bug but I am worried it may actually do some damage to my device and render the real Apple cords unusable.<br /><br />Does anybody else notice this and have you had any problems over the long haul?",3,1
"I purchased this because I prefer black colored cables, and I wanted the extra 3' so that I could use my phone while plugged in.  Well, the product LOOKED like it would work. But unfortunately, was dead on arrival.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I wrote a review, and they immediately offered to replace cable free of charge without shipping original back, so that was pretty nice of them.  Hopefully, this new one will work and that was just a freak incident.<br /><br />Changed rating from 1 to 3 stars, will upgrade to 5 stars if my replacement works without issue.",3,1
"It works exactly as promised.  But I wish that I had bought a devise with a minimal display that shows speed, altitude, distance traveled so I could also use it when exercising.",3,1
"Not exactly what I ordered. I was under the understanding that this had a hard face cover, not just a soft static cover.  It also has a camera hole for a newer ipod touch. It fit ok, but has an extra hole.  Luckily, my daughter isn't picky so I don't have to return it",3,2
"I really like the HD radio capability; it brings a good variety of choices.  It takes a little longer to install just to find a good location for the HD receiver, but still pretty easy to set everything up.    I have owned a few pioneer receivers in the past, and as far as quality goes, it's about average.  I think that the clarity is strong, but it will have distortion when the base is turned up.  My previous DEH 6700 pioneer did wonderful for the sound quality all-round, but the DEH-P401HD just doesn't have that extra boost.    As far as navigating through the controls, it is over complicated.  I use to be able to not look at the controls to adjust the audio settings; or to find a particular station; and now, I find myself having to wait at a stop light just to find another saved radio station.      Overall, I think this is just an average receiver with HD.  It will take some time getting use to the controls; there are a lot better options available.",3,1
this antenna will work for a while and then the same problems crop up. first water will get into the antenna and rust it out making it useless. next the connection near the radio will break just above the plastic sleeve. have purchased a few of these and it is allways the same. some last a long time others not. be very gentle when disconnecting antenna from radio and it will last a little longer. sirius should fix this defect.,3,2
"It works fine, but it is starting to fall apart where pieces were glued together.  I still like it though and it's worth the money.",3,1
"Firstly, after opening the box, there was no charger. Not really a problem but don't say your provided with one then I wouldn't look for it. Secondly, the instructions is absolutely useless. It reads like scrabble, random words making no sense. Nothing in the book tells you how to set the clock or change the language to English. The language of the camera is in Russian and I have no idea how to change it although I used every combination of the buttons. Couldn't get the unit to mount with the Suction mount. It fell off numerous times. Ended up having to jam it in. There is no IR night vision so once again, don't advertise it as such. The camera quality is ok. It takes random videos of about 2 mins each video. Once again, I can't figure out how to change the length of recording. Purchase if you only want a challenge.<br /><br />Update: Managed to change the language to English.",3,2
"I've owned a few of these \\""chi-pods\\"". This one is the best looking I've had. These things are not easiest to work with. They don't play mp4's(even though it says so in the description). You have to use the converter on the disk to change them to avi.The pictures and video seem to be OK. The battery life isnt that great. They're cheap and if all you want to do is listen to music they're good for that. If you want a multi media player these might not be the best choice.",3,1
Light weight and cute colors- the pod feels secure but a little difficult to get in and out of pocket. Not sure it's waterproof which ceases the option of running in the rain,3,1
Worked ok.,3,2
This case is really cool and indestructable but it has a problem with the paint coming off. It is still really cool.,3,1
yes,3,1
"For your money you get what you pay for. Does not have loud volume, remote works sometimes. Not that good with stations.",3,2
"The sound quality is OK, but it's very difficult to find a channel that is available to use in a major metropolitan area with a number of radio stations.",3,2
"I ordered this 2011 Garmin Product because I had not kept up with updating maps on an older Garmin Product.  There were pros and cons to the newer model.  Let me begin with the Pros: 1) The price--substantially lower than the product we purchased 5-6 yrs ago.  2) Light weight 3) An LED screen that illuminated nicely.<br />There were cons as well: 1) I found the newer Garmin Product difficult to program (often took at least two attempts). 2) The dashboard mount was ok, but is not aesthetically appealing.  If I were to purchase the product again, I would have probably read some reviews first.  It is adequate, however, and will serve our family needs.",3,1
"It's ok, but not as slick as I expected. I, and a friend, tried to figure out how to transmit through the car radio. There aren't any instructions and we can't figure it out. Since it's mounted in the power outlet it's not real rigid, I think I was expecting too much. But for $20 bucks it's not worth returning. I use it from time to time.",3,2
"Have an older model of Cambridge SoundWorks AM/FM radio that works so well I ordered the Ambiance.  But it falls short in that AM/FM reception is poor, cannot change from AM to FM by using the remote, when listening to Pandora there are pauses while signal is gathered, and have not yet found a way to make the Blue Tooth feature work.",3,2
"Its an Ok product. After six months, it starts to pilled on the edge and scrathes appeared on the surface.",3,2
"It is easy to create static with the slightest movement, but it does help with understanding soft-spoken actors on tv.",3,1
I was very disappointed that my Ipod couldnt play Pandora like advertised. It should've said only through the Iphone. The Usb cord is only for the I-products and thumbdrive not a regular smartphone. I brought wanting to listen to Pandora with my smartphone or Ipod but that's not happening. Everything else on it works great.,3,1
The voice seems garbled and hard to understand  My wife cant make out what the voice is saying in noisey traffic.,3,1
"I bot this as a refurb to save a few bucks.  The Sansa Clip+ came very quickly, but with minimal instructions (in English on a copied page) and the device as I received it only displayed some Arabic script language, so I had no idea what it was doing as I went thru the menus. To use this device fully you really need to go to the SanDisk website and download the User Guide.  Fortunately, there was a support article on resetting the language used, and it worked. So after about a half our of searching and reading online I had English menus finally.  I have hunch it was just a return item that got reshipped without being checked out. However, after extensive testing, it seems to work perfectly now.<br /><br />The device itself is surprisingly tiny, but easy to use. The included earphones were old style, and uncomfortable, so I used own low cost and comfy earbuds and the audio was quite good. The rechargeable battery life also seems quite good (as advertised). 8 GB of built in memory is awesome and will hold several days worth of MP3 tracks - not to mention that you can add on a micro SD card for a lifetime supply of music and other audio.<br /><br />The main menu functions are: MUSIC (complete with folders, for music categories, audio books, etc.) for use with internal memory, slotRADIO (uses the external MicroSD card), FM RADIO (works quite well), VOICE (built in audio recorder), and SETTINGS (with everything from Date/Time, to power saving settings.  The USB cable for connection (and charging) to a PC works as expected, and the device is recognized and used like a USB drive for up/downloading your files.  Over all the controls and menus are pretty intuitive and easy to use once you see how they work.<br /><br />The VOICE function was a very pleasant \\""surprise\\"".  It is barely mentioned in the description, but I found it to be exceptionally good with great sensitivity, clarity, and very low internal noise.  I now plan to use the device as a clip-on microphone recorder for video work rather than ordering a specialized (and more expensive) audio recorder.  The device itself is not much bigger than a good clip-on mic, and its built-in clip is more than adequate for secure attaching to clothing or other objects.<br /><br />I would have given this little MP3 player 4-5 stars if it had arrived with the language set properly and with better instructions.  However the hassle factor of having to figure everything out the Hard Way warrants the downgrade to 3 stars for this particular unit.",3,1
"The Good: You can't buy the materials for the price you pay. Carpet was tight and neatly applied. The air volume is perfect for the 12&#34; woofers I have.<br />The Bad: Poor assembly! States&#34;Sealed Hatch Sub Woofer&#34;....was anything but sealed. Air gaps on all seams of cabinet.One of the terminal cups arrived cracked.<br />The Outcome: With a tube of good quality sealant, I was able to make the cabinet tight.",3,2
"This item is a converter for CHARING, not a converter to play music. I wanted it to play music, but it doesn't do that. Lame!",3,2
Clips are too short for the slats in the vents in a 2007 F150.  Should have measured before I ordered.,3,2
"Initial language setup was Korean or Chinese, took a while to figure out to change to English. Need to add micro card for record.  Manual is somewhat confusing, good luck with that.  Just have to try the buttons and figure them out, trial and error.",3,2
"I purchased this to use on a road trip and had mixed results. I'm giving it 3 stars becuase it really only half works.  The fm transmitter worked fine.  In fact, it had the best sound quality of any transmitter I've tried.  The charging portion of this was crap.  The first time I hooked it up, I thought it was great.  It charged the phone fast.  After that first time though, it never worked right again.  The best I can get from the charger is that it maintains the battery level on the phone wherever it is at when you plug it in, but it does not charge the phone at all.  I thought maybe my cigarette lighter was failing but my gps and other phone chargers all worked without a hitch, so it has to be a failure by this unit.",3,1
"When I received this product, I was glad because it came much earlier than it was scheduled, but when I wanted to bag 1 TB external hard drive cover, I realized with amazement that it does not fit too well. The cover is made beautiful, but when I seem resistant hard drive inside, zipper and can be very stretched to give the seam. Overall, not too fit for external WD 1 TB.",3,1
This was a good price but it needs to fit better. Surface of product has a nice feel and gives great grip.,3,1
"This is definitely a great price, but it does have a bit of an echoing effect when you transmit.  I would recommend this more for those who listen to the radio more than they talk.",3,1
"This design is cute fun but a but its a little small. There will be empty space and if you want a protector for your Ipod this is not the case for you. Its easy to remove and put back on. It feels and looks nice but like I said its not a protector but if you would like a protector go to the Speck Products SPK-A0113 Rubberized PixelSkin Case for iPod touch 4G for great protection and for a nice feel and cute design. So if your looking for a cute case but not protective, and your okay with it being a little small, this would be the case for you!!",3,1
"Not sure I'd call it great.  It has pretty decent sound, but could definitely use more treble.  A little dull sounding.  The door for the cd player feels flimsy.  The radio tunes in well.  No sound adjustments except more bass.  I think it will last for awhile.  Not sure about the cd door that could easily wear out and not close or stay closed anymore.  Sure wish they made different colors!!  UGLY grey.  lol  But they all seem to be black or grey.",3,1
"Interesting operating system running windows ce. has some nice extras. Couldn't figure out how to update it through the web. I bought it for just one trip. I usually use my phone for navigation, but was going to the mountains where cell signal is spotty. For the price it did what it is suppose to do, it kept me from getting lost and had most of the small mountain roads listed.",3,1
"It's huge, bulky, and ugly as sin but it will give you about 50% more usage time. Takes forever to recharge.",3,2
I basically like the handsfree speaker portion but recharging the battery has been a bit of a problem. The charger sent with the speaker requires use of a 6 volt cigar lighter unit in your vehicle.  The charger did not work well in the vehicle we normally use and I've had to carry out any charging requirements using the outlets in my pickup.  Perhaps the charger sent with my unit is faulty - its hard to say.,3,1
"When it got too hot, this would fall off of our dashboard. It is actually meant to be attached to the windshield (it has a suction cup), and then it works well.",3,1
"Seems to lack some of the features of newer, similarly priced models, such as traffic alerts and unlimited on-line updates.",3,1
"It is a bright, white light when you look at it, but as far as actually providing light to illuminate your path when going in reverse, it doesn't really do that. Would be beneficial to have a bulb that does both as form without function doesn't necessarily help out when you are trying to go in reverse on a dark street or parking lot.",3,1
"I bought this and installed it in my 96 Honda civic. It is sturdily built, and was a snap to install. Its pretty easy to loosen the wingnut on the back and shift between portait and landscape, and holds the iPad far enough away from the passenger to be comfortable. Its also fairly easy to undo the wingnut enough to remove the plastic bracket and stash it, leaving only the gooseneck in view, throwing potential criminals off the scent (I live in an urban environment where this is a concern).     I have 2 complaints:  1. While it holds an unprotected iPad very securely, you need to remove your case every time, which, with an Otterbox, is annoying.   2. It NEEDS a damper. Its got a mass, its got a spring, it needs a damper! The long, rigidly fixed gooseneck arm holding the relatively heavy ipad at the end tends to propogate vibrations. So much so that, without the screen lock, the ipad can switch from portait to landscape to portait while shaking. I plan on installing a support damper somewhere further up the gooseneck to help with this.     All in all, its a great was to hold the ipad, and is not a cheap-o piece of Chinese made junk. If you have a case you can get the iPad in and out of quickly, and are willing to brace the gooseneck further up, its probably the best solution out there for an iPad car mount.",3,1
when i got my ear force x32 in i went to hook them up and found out i  had to spend more money to make them work for my ps3 it will coast like 30 $ for what you will need witch will make them wired so if you are looking for wireless these are not for you,3,2
"as a police officer in today's environment, you have to have something extra to watch over you. People see this camera and think twice about giving me a hard time... yet there are some issues with it. Cost... outstanding. Can't beat it. If you need something quick and dirty this is it. The clip is very limited and do to the positioning you have to have it in low on your uniform or combine it with one of the other holders. It is okay friends, but I am already looking to upgrade to something with some more meat to it. Day time is good, night time recording is good. The difficulty comes when you are trying to make sure the thing is turned on and recording. I am sorry this doesnt work well.. &#34;excuse me sir/ma'am whom is acting a fool.. I need to make sue for my safety and yours my camera is recording.&#34; you need a sure thing, and this is okay.",3,1
"I purchased the RadTech 13-860 ProCable Shortz Dock Extender. I didn't know what to expect because the information wasn't explicit about the product. It is a short plastic peace approximately 1\\"" long and 1-1/4\\"" wide. It pushes into the bottom of the case where you connect the charging cable. It is not that easy to attach because you need to push down the door on the case to get it in and I found on mine that it opens up the case on one side. No matter what I do I can't keep the case clicked shut tight. You then can connect a car charger and house charger to it. It does take care of connecting a charger to it. But they need to come up with an attachment that is perhaps an \\""L\\"" shape to eliminate popping the case open just to attach this peace. It also is overpriced for what you get.",3,2
"The price is really unbeatable for this complete set of so many useful parts. Note that the \\""USB data cable\\"" does not fit the iPod of the 4th generation, but you can use the original USB cable to fix that problem. The quality of all components is good.",3,1
This is not actually a wallet in that it doesn't open.  It is a sleeve that the phone slides into.<br />If that is what you are looking for then this is a very good deal.,3,2
"I read the description twice and I still can not tell exactly what this is or how it works.  Ok, it is a GPS tracker, but how do I use it?  Is it real-time?  Is it a GPS recorder?  You can't sell many of these if the potential customer has to guess.",3,2

"The Leather case is good quality.  Good access for charging devices and head phones, but no place for the stylus and the magnet snap closure does not automatically snap in place, you have to fumble around to get the 2 connections to match. Absence of stylus holder is the BIG drawback for me. I have ordered the Noreve brand because it does have the stylus holder and looks like the snap is easier to work with.\\""",3,1
Item ok but would not buy again or recommend  seems to loose its volume after a few uses  doesn't hold nook very well,3,2
Having some issues with connectivity. Not sure if this is because it was a refurbished item.,3,1
only reason them get 3 stars is because they were cheap.  I plugged it in to test it and when I unplugged it the whole plug broke pulling the wires out of the thing.,3,2
"I have used the pass holder on my car windshield several times and each time it has fallen off, even without the EZ Pass in it.",3,1
I had it for a year and dropped it and broke the screen now it doesn't work. Not the players fault.,3,2
Connects fine but audio quality is just so so.,3,1
For the price the case is very good with perfect fit for the 2nd generation nook with glow light. It allows the access to all the buttons nicely.<br /><br />The two points the go against the product is thr quality of the leather. I have had other cases for my kindle (although more expensive) which has but better leather resistant to wear and tear. Thr other thing that is bad about the product is the elastic band used for closing thr cases. I had expected it to be magnetic like other cases but this one has a flimsy elastic band for holding close the case. The band is not yet broken after a months use but is on thr verge. Once it breaks I will be fishing for a second case.,3,1
The product is alright. It doesnt fit quite right. The case also makes it hard to put headphones or a connector cord into.,3,2
"Great price but the fit left a little to be desired. The fit around the back is Ok, but the edges around the front sagged a bit.",3,1
"This item works so so<br />and work just fair, Alpine should work to make it better, this product have potential<br /><br />for example<br />always, each time a song starts playing, it  play for 2 seconds the it pause for 1 second, while the eX-10 retrieve the display image from the albun, and then it continues playing<br /><br />also the bluetooth connection, really sucks<br />I have Nokia N73, and it doesnt work<br />only the firt time, it play the conversation using the radio speaker, and then it never work again<br />each time i made or receive a conversation, I have to use the phone to talk",3,2
the item works well but depending on the phone you have if the inbuilt voice activation has a low volume then you will find it hard to hear  the opions,3,1
"I really liked this cover.  It's pretty and soft and makes handling the ipod so much easier (less slippery).  Unfortunately, the cover comes too close to the headphone jack so that the plug can't snap all the way in and you can't use the headphones with the cover on.  I'll keep it, just can't use it for listening, and that's kinda what the ipod is for.",3,2
"it worked somewhat fine, although you needed to have the iPod in PERFECT spots, otherwise it would SHHHHHH annoyingly over your music. It was a hassle to deal with it while driving, and sometimes better off without it. Maybe it works better with small iPods.",3,1
"I love the design and color of this cover, however it makes the screen protector bubble up. I don't think I would recommend this to my friends.",3,1
THE SOUND ISNT TO CLEAR. STATIC WHEN USING BOTH EAR PLUGS,3,1
"Good product for the price; clear voice when speaking unless there is noise around you (i.e. wind, traffic, someone is ruffling papers, etc.) There is also short static before and after speaking. The description and packaging says noise/wind reduction but there is no button to press to activate (like other brands) and as mentioned there is alot of background noise.",3,1
"Can't really comment on this purchase, unfortunately I ordered the wrong key it looks nothing like the original key. I don't<br />think review is going to help anyone. sorry guys.",3,2
This case is pretty durable but the clip is kinda cheap. Other than the clip it works well. On a scale 1 to 10 one being the worse it is a 4.,3,1
"I was really impressed with the ease of installation and the playback quality.  But, when I went to test drive, I put my sunnies on and the Alpine screen went blank....the GPS and iPhone screens were OK, but Alpine....Blacked out.  Took the Sunnies off and back came the screen.  Must have something to do with polarizing effect of sunnies.  Sunnies are more important, so now Alpine is back in its box.",3,1
"This case is durable and fits the iPod very well without covering much of the front, which was my initial attraction to this case.  My biggest complaint about it is that it now looks like I've rubbed it against sandpaper or rocks.  The  back scratches so easily.  Also, if I ever want to take it off I think I may have to break it to do so.  The case does take some finesse when putting it on because the portion around the 30pin port is very thin and seems to be fragile.  I think this will break easily if it try to take the case off my iPod.  If you're looking for a durable case that isn't bulky and don't mind the superficial issues then I'd recommend it...maybe try it black or white so the scratches aren't as apparent.",3,1
"I have to say that I love the look and function of the case; however, I've not been impressed by the function of the keyboard.  Several of the keys stick and the shift function keys have to be pressed on quite hard in order to work properly.  I may look into exchanging the keyboard.",3,1
I will start with the cons. The headphones did not work out of the box. I was not going to use them anyway but most people would be upset about that. The ipod coppied spinwheel is just for decorations you must click buttons to do anything. The instructions would be useless because there is so little to them and much is needed because despite having only 5 buttons navigating is confusing until you get the hang of it. However the instructions on the inside are just wrong. You might as well throw it away because it will be easier to figure out on your own. It will take time to figure all the options out too. Some buttons i cant even tell if they work or when they work. Navigating the different folders (bands/singers) is annoying and a crapshoot to find out if songs will replay over and over. I have found that starting from the beginning works well but if you want to skip a song you have to click the skip button for each song.<br />the pros...a 64gb mp3 player for under $30. The sound is average and the equalizer helps but if you are looking for premium sound this isnt it.<br />the setup to put music on from my wmp was quick and easy. I am not sure if i got an exclusive deal but for the money i paid and for what i use it for (at work where it can potentially break easily) it was a steal. If i compare it to the ipod that it is trying to copy then it is garbage.<br />my advice is if you dont mind figuring out menus then this is for you. If you want to play the music you want when you want and easily navigatethe menus then this is not for you. If you have to pay retail price there are better options.,3,2
"It looked alot thicker to me than it actually is.  It is a snug fit & you can see it stretch on the sides, bulges a little. But I expect it to stretch & have smoother lines on sides.",3,2
"I like this product a lot, however - it does sound better underwater (otherwise a little tinny) and the earbuds are great until you try to change them out - then they are....  I still cannot get one side fixed (it broke off).  I would suggest buying separate earbuds.",3,2
"This case is alright. A little flimsy. It's for looks, not protection. It doesn't have a hole for you to charge your ipod. I also don't really love the look of the holes on top of the case(that makes it look like a cassette tape) because i can see my ipod through it. I paid about 3 bucks for it, so I'm fine with the price.",3,1
"Well put together, has several compartments & pouches, plenty of storage and good paddings. I just wish it was 100% leather.",3,1
"It works fine. My mistake getting 1 foot long. You have no idea how short 1 foot is for a cable until you use it. For example, unless the electrical source is in front of or below the device, you cannot have it facing you, it will be facing away. If you want a useful but manageable length, get 3 feet. Also, the Lightening side is a bit thicker than the OEM, so if you have a case with a small opening for the Lightening port, it may be difficult to attach.",3,2
Kick ass tweets little heavy but f n sharp jet like tweet is ear piercing you need the hiss loud tssst beat its this one I gave it 3 stars mounting plate is crappy,3,1
"It's too tight for my ipod with protective rubber cover to slip into!<br />Otherwise, it works very good as a belt holder & for reading the ipod",3,1
Good but not as loud as i thought it would be.<br />But other the that its a good lil speaker,3,1
"It's a pretty good pack for the price, but it's quality really lacks.    The cases (why on earth would anyone need 2 of the same exact case in the first place?) are really not the best quality, mine had little bubbles in the silicon and the edges of the cases cover up a bit of the screen.  It also makes it difficult to type with it on.    The wall and car chargers don't look like anything like what they did in the pictures and when I charge my zune on the wall charger, I can't scroll on the touch screen at all.  The chargers definately do their job though.    The usb cable works for charging my zune, but I can't sync with my pc with it.    As for the screen protector, I wasn't able to use it because my sister got curious and pulled the films off before I even recieved my zune from amazon.  Although, if you want to see reviews for the screen protectors, I think that the exact same kind of screen protector are by this same seller under \\""3 pack of crystal clear screen protectors for Zune HD\\""    I give this product a 3/5 stars because of the bad quality but good price.  As a better alternative to this and for about 5 bucks more, gizmodorks has alot of combo packs with all the exact same stuff AND a speaker dock AND you can choose what color silicon case you would like.",3,1
It makes a loud popping sound when it is working.  What the fudge?  Is it supposed to do that? Huh?,3,2
"It's not clear, it's frosted. I'm disappointed because I wanted a clear case. It's just ok.",3,2
It hisses when charging and when making a phone call person receiving call hears echo of their voice.<br /><br />I was somewhat disappointed but am working with it.,3,2
"the lcd was very well packed, impossible to break during shipment. the quality is reasonable. well If u consider the price you'll pay it's really great, but if u are expecting the same quality of the original LCD, forget it! the color  is a little bit different, the contrast can also be a little strange. Resuming: for the price u pay is a good product, but if u want to replace with the same quality as the original try something else.",3,1
"Pros:<br />1) Great eink screen.<br />2) Great touch screen.<br />3) Long battery life<br />4) Good dictionary definitions of English words.<br />5) Translation dictionaries from English to Spanish, German, French, Italian and vice versa<br />Cons:<br />1) The software does not have the option to create my own catalogs for my books.<br />2) Can not add for use other dictionaries, for example, in my case, my mother tongue is Spanish, so I have many books in Spanish and I need a dictionary definitions of Spanish words and I have one, but, the ereader Kobo touch does not have the option to add any dictionary.",3,1
Looks more like leather than vinyl in the picture. It is very cheesy and disappointing for the price. It gives false quality features by having leather in any of the description.,3,2
"I got this case as added protection for my iPhone 4s when I have it in my purse.  There is just one problem - it does not allow enough room for the iPhone to be put into it.  Fortunately, I knew someone with a smaller phone and was able to give them the Golla Pouch.  They are happy with it.<br /><br />Do not buy this pouch if you have an iPhone!",3,1
I just wanna know if the faceplate comes off if you can please help me . I need to know,3,1
The screen is not well readable by any means but it does it's job. There's also no way to see when it's fully charged so it's kind of a hit and miss but it works pretty well.,3,1
"This is great if you have a poor laptop speaker system, for example, or want to be able to hear a walkman or ipod without headphones, but it does not get very loud without distorting.  This is not nearly as good as a powered speaker system.  The novelty is that you put it on things and the sound comes from that object.  A coffee can seems to work best for us.",3,1
"If it were anything over five dollars, I'd say it's not worth buying. However, it is not, so it is worth it!<br /><br />It scratches fairly easily, and the paint chips from the front corners, but it looks OK and it protects the iPod at an astoundingly low cost.<br /><br />Update: after nearly a year, it's still in one piece. The thin point between the camera and top of case cracked, but it's not structurally significant. Paint has continued to chip from the corners and edges.",3,2
"I did 3 out of 5 because of fitment. First off the description states that it works on all Sonata fe years. I got this as a gift for someone to replace the broken duct taped one they had. Also the original one has a metal clip that holds the battery in place allowing it to work, where the New one does not. I switched over the guts of the old remote along with its rubber. The fitment was off and I could not get it to close.<br /><br />I ended up using the old backing and had to use the new rubber buttons with the guts. Still had to force it shut! all in all it gets the job done and she is happy!",3,1
Kinda cheap breaks easily,3,2
"I just got this unit. It sounds great. There is a major problem, though. I am using this unit to play one single MP3 file of white noise. The length of the track is 7 hours. The unit successfully plays the track and repeats it, just as I'd like. The problem is that the sound just drops out completely every now and then. I have no idea what the problem is. Perhaps it is only playing a minute or so of the track and then repeating it, with a short half-second delay? I am not sure how it would decide how much of the track to play before looping, unless there is some sort of looping function. The unit is useless to me unless I can fix this problem.  Edit: They send me a new unit pronto! Unfortunately, the problem remains. Perhaps I need to try different SD cards.  Edit again: I made several different versions of MP3 files of the same recording to see if bit rate would have any impact on this problem. My original MP3 file was written at 192 kbps. I rewrote the file at 96 kbps, and that reduced the number of dropouts - but not totally to zero. I tried reducing the bit rate to 64 kbps and 48 kbps, but the audio quality was so bad that I didn't even consider staying with those rates.",3,2
Cool enough could have had a usb port though,3,1
"Mine worked right out of the box.  The suction cup mount is kinda klunky and hard to position if you want a square video picture. The camera lens is floppy and needs to be tightened up somehow - maybe jam something behind the moving part.<br />Screen language was in Russian, but you can fool around and find the 'language' setting & get English.  Manual is not real easy to use, but you can figure it out; would be nice to have an explanation of what the screen icons mean.<br />I can see license plates & street signs, when close enough.  Plays back on PC easily.  The supplied USB cable was junk; I replaced it with one I had on hand.  The auto on/off feature only works if you plug it into a switched cigarette lighter port, like on newer cars.<br />Got a rear view mirror type as well & compare.  This suction cup type blocks the visor and the view somewhat.  Maybe there is a better mount type somewhere.<br />Be nice to have a brick & mortar store out there to visit & compare.  Overall, not bad for the money.",3,1
"It's ok, I hate having to reset the station every time you plug it in or turn the car on.  Also, my friends have other models and they tend to not experience as much static.  The sound is ok for some songs, but not ok for others.  It's kinda weird how that happens.",3,2
I purchased this case for my daughter's iPod Touch and she loves it.  I do not love it but think it is OK.  The case has trouble staying snapped together at 1 corner.  It seems almost too small for the iPod.  The case looks cute but could be made to fit better.,3,1
"Well, I order the 6-pack Mirrow Screen protector is a good protector,it look good on the Ipod 4, the only thing is the scratch fast, well is because I have a 2 year old and he play whit the Ipod alot , but is good.",3,1
"This is my very first GPS receiver and it's a great looking product which is easily stowed inside a pocket. As I'd expect, reception isn't great when traveling between tall buildings or deep ravines; but oh well. Other than that it works wonderfully, five-star rating. I've tested it on hikes, bikes, and driving. In that respect, I cannot complaint whatsoever as it proved to be very trustworthy and was very excited about it.    But for only the first three three months. After that time (bought it elsewhere), this GPSlim 240 unit stopped reporting the position. Just like that. Although the Bluetooth signal was detected, the output was gibberish both on my mobile and computer, and the device even claimed it had a satellite lock deep inside a building! I went to the store, and asked for repair under the warranty.     After three weeks, a new unit was returned to replace the original. As soon as I step outside, I try it and now it works. Awesome!     But for only 1 mile when ... poof, no more Bluetooth reception from the GPS receiver! However, the two lights still blink (therefore it has battery, has satellite lock and, supposedly, has Bluetooth activated). This time, no receptor I have can find the GPSlim 240 by Bluetooth; and I only had this new unit for less than 10 minutes!     Although I'm disappointed by the perceived frailty of this device, both the performance it has demonstrated for the first three months and the fact that it's still covered by the warranty, gives me plenty of reason to hope it may finally work again some day with the same reliability I was already used to. I'm just hoping I'm not disappointed about it again.",3,2
Great speakers for incoming reception but poor mic pick-up for outgoing; the receiving party could not hear as well as when I used only my cell phone and had the cell phone on speaker.,3,2
"Bought this kit for my 2011 Frontier. Disappointed  in the way the light assemblies  are mounted. They either mount to the bumpers with brackets or mount in the fog light blanks after modifications. Not impressed by this last option it involves using PVC pipe and is less than detailed how how this is done. I am sure I will evenualy figure it out ,but I was expecting more. Otherwise everything looks pretty good for the money. Would I buy it again?  Probably if nothing else better was available in this price range as this was about all I wanted to spend.",3,1

"For the price, the clip-Dat Mini clip MP3 player provides good sound, easy pick up from the song you left off on, and convenience of portability. The biggest issue I have had with this product is that when inserting the headphones, or pressing the fast forward/rewind buttons, the pressure causes the micro SD card to pop up/out and has to be reinserted. The product I purchased did not come with the USB-HSD cord, luckily I had a spare one to attach to it. The player does not work or even read without the micro SD card,and  because there were no instructions, I found this out through trial and error. A plus is that this device can support up to a 8GB micro SD card so I can have a large selection of music at my fingertips.",3,2
"I was looking for cases for my old iPod mini and I found that they are still selling it, and think it a mad thing to buy such an old model for such high prices, because you can buy a new model of iPod for a lower price or the same and much more benefits.<br />I had my iPod for 6 years now, it works pretty good and the battery still holds for more than a couple of hours, the only problem I see with it is that sometimes it stops working and you have until the battery is dead or longer to recharge it and it would work perfectly again this doesn't happen with my sister iPod Nano 4 generation and she can see pictures and videos in her iPod.<br />Since iPod mini is a pretty basic model it is heavier than other models and have some problems that the new version don't have, that is why I recommend you buying a newer model.",3,1
"I chose 3-5 business day shipping and I received it in 2, so great shipping. But sometimes, when I hit a cymbal or pad, another cymbal or pad will go off unexpectedly, but this is very rare initially and overall the product is extremely useful. But as you play more, the drums will begin to malfunction quite often and I eventually just returned it and went with the Alesis DM10 model. I also suggest getting an amplifier for the drums if you keep it or get any other electric drums:  [[ASIN:B002C4QTWA Alesis TransActive Drummer Electronic Drum Amplifier]] or [[ASIN:B000OY4WA6 Roland Cube Monitor / PA]]",3,1
"When I received this, the screen was a bit damaged. It works fine though, I figured out the rotation when I first plugged it in. Yeah it does suck when you have to unplug it and every time you replug it it has to be reset to the station. It has better quality than my old $10 FM transmitter I'll say that. But really, its an okay transmitter.",3,1
"The iTouch cover didn't come with a leather chamois or spray bottle, as stated.  It did not fit my iTouch very well.  Sides flare out instead of being straight.  Doesn't look like a cover that cost that much money.",3,2
"I'm torn by this product. Boxwave shipped the three pack quickly. They arrived within time and well packaged.<br /><br />The minute I tried to use this product on my phone, well it was clearly too big.  My phone has a 55mm x 40mm screen. The protector shipped is 59mm x 45mm. So immediately I looked for a phone number, contact information. Things started to go downhill here. There's absolutely no phone number anywhere to call this company. No PHONE. No person to talk to. The only way to contact them, e-mail, with only a suggestion that they will get back to you within 48 hours.<br /><br />Sent off my email complaining of the wrong size. Got a response three or four days later that basically said, tough that's the size they sell. My phone is not the right model, and I can return them for a refund. By that time I had cut two down trying to make them fit my phone. So for $10 I'm not going to monkey around with returning one of them.<br /><br />So beware that you have the correct phone model. Note the size carefully.<br /><br />The quality of the product. These are crystal clear. They are shiny. They are pretty thin. They do not change the screen view at all. But mine has now developed some kind of green/blue dark stripes when viewing on an angle in flourescent light. I now have to wait for three or four days to hear a response from Boxwave.<br /><br />I'm not exactly sure I'll ever order from Boxwave again.",3,2

"Have to figure out most of the operations on your own, bad manual. Suction cup has held up great for a few weeks so far and is easy to lock down or remove. I cannot use my power port because it has power even when the truck is off so the camera won't cut off. I will wire it into a direct power supply at the mirror which cuts off when vehicle off to solve that problem plus no wires to run. Still figuring out some of the features, which there are all you need present.

"The product is great for the cost! It does have some disadvantages. Sometimes it doesn't reconize the iPhone and does not accept a charge.

I bought this mount to attach my Garmin to the handlebar of my motorcycle. The only problem is that the angle of the handlebar is such that the face of the Garmin is not at an angle I can see.

good,3,1
"This cartridge has been highly rated by Amazon customers and that's why I bought it. It does bring out the voices well, but, not as much on the other backround music (guitars, sax, drums, etc.) It is actually the same pet peave I have about cd's, as cd's appear to be only able to reproduce one thing well at a time making the recordings sound two dimensional (but, AT120E is still far better than any digital recording). I have also purchased it's bigger brother, the AT440Mla and have the same issue with it. Audio Technia used to equip new PL120 turntables with the ATP-2 cartrige which is an in your face cartridge that keeps from being shrill. It produces what I call a &#34;wall of sound&#34; that kind of envelopes the listener. I assume they still sell the ATP-2, but, it came equiped with a needle that tracked at 3 to 5 grams for DJ'S. That's way to heavy for my precious 40 year old albums. I bought a new needle that tracks at 1.0 - 1.75 grams for the ATP-2 and this is now by far my favorite cartridge/needle. If you like the Beatles and CCR, this cartridge sounds fantasic running it through my Marantz Model 6300 TT, Sansui G6700 amp, and my JBL studio speakers. The Shure M97xe is also good, but, I like the ATP-2 better.",3,1
"Loved it at first, but the clip broke after a couple of months (the plastic portion of the clip around the metal cylindrical piece broke and could not be repaired). I like it while it worked!",3,2

"Pros:<br />Great size.  Really nice, full sound.  Strong bluetooth range.<br />Haven't tested the water-proof abilities and probably won't.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The NFC pairing seems non-existent.  The manual tells me to put the phone on an NFC label that simply is not there.  Why do I care?  Well, there is a voice that tells you when you connect/disconnect.  Part of me likes knowing but the problem is that when I'm in another part of my house and coming in and out of range there is an odd male voice upstairs scaring my kids.  Well. maybe just freaking them out a little.  I bought this, in part, because the NFC should let me connect when I'm in the room and disconnect when I walk out.  Instead, I can't do that.<br /><br />So while I really like the sound and size I'm debating if I will return this due to a non-existent feature.",3,1
"For the price, the outer cover works fine. The cover fits perfectly and securely snaps shut. The belt clip is flimsy, though. The clip doesn't stay attached to the case very well. If I were wearing my ipod with the clip, I'd be scared it would fall off. Overall, the hard case itself is worth the few dollars spent.",3,1
"LOD (Line Out Dock) is an important piece of the chain. Using a Nickel plated cable made in China is going to severly limit your listening experience.<br /><br />If your using low-end gear maybe it's not such a bad choice, in my experience Monster has been at par or even better than at times (their headphones are basically ghetto-blasters that need no outside AMP or DAC, because they're just LOUD). Fiio, I have simply hated at every turn. I've tried all their amps, E6, E7, E11 and Esomething, this always angers people because many-many people are having good experiences with Fiio. It's up to you. That's just my two cents.<br /><br />Anyway, go to ALOaudio  or  Moon-audio (dot the com) and drop a hundred bucks or so and get a gold-plated silver-copper mixture that is going to make your music sound like it should. Warm and clear.<br /><br />If your really down with quality, go audioquest. They have silver cables, LOD, mini-to-mini (3.5mm) and USB to 30-pin iPod sync cable with (PSS) Pure Silver Surface -THESE CABLES ARE ON FIRE. Personally using the aux input in my car with an iPod 5.5 and a PSS 3.5mm cable, it added 50 watts to my stereo. I was so shocked I brought it to the dealer who had never heard a stereo in my model car THAT loud. Amazing cables, unfortunately in the 600-1800$ range. They also have \\""Carbon\\"" and Cinnamon\\"" level cables that are silver-plated copper mixtures, still excellent and half the price or less. The Angel/Diamond (pure silver) cables also have DBS (Dialectic Bias System) that makes your cable require no break-in period -supposedly.<br /><br />Gold plated, anything but this crap.",3,1
"I ordered a lot of these for work. Some work, some didn't. The biggest problem is the plug. The plug isn't tight enough for most of our Kenwood radios. The ones that did work my guys like them. Better than paying $100 each to get the Kenwood brand.",3,1
"When I read rubberized, I understood it to be silicone outside, plastic inside, or some sort of a mix. Nonetheless, this is a pretty nice case. Offers good protection and feels quite nice.<br /><br />The things I disliked were that there is no grip to it on the back. If you were to set it on a table it'll slide if you pushed it. It grips okay in the hand, but it wouldn't be safe laying on a desk or on the dashboard of car. This case leaves the home button open, which feels a little awkward since its raised above it. This also leaves the volume and power buttons open, which I don't like in a case.<br /><br />Overall, it's a fairly cheap case, slips into pockets well, offers fairly decent protection for a good price, and comes with some nice accessories. I suggest using it as a temporary case perhaps, but it's definitely worth investing in a more expensive case.",3,1
Didn't cost much which is good since it does work but will wear out rather quickly. This one at least the velcro is staying attatched for now.,3,1
This was simple enough for me to operate and to do what I need it to do. I thought the sound that came out of the speaker was loud enough to be heard in a meeting room on a presentation. The right price for the right gadget!,3,1

On the second use I did a long hold on the next button to increase the volume, it made a loud beeping noise and shut off.

Tuning stations is very difficult<br /> - all the switches and dials are small, hard to read and feel cheap",3,1
"This case is nice quality and well constructed but it seems backwards. The closing tab is on the left if you want to have the Kindle facing you on the right when the case is open. And then the metal logo is on the back side.It is made for a left-handed person, not a right-handed person",3,1
Pretty flimsy.  It's more of a decorative cover.  Not sure it would protect the ipod in any way if dropped.,3,2

"Pairs up and connects fine. 2 complaints, though.<br /><br />1. It lags the tv speakers and sounds confusing when both are playing. I use it only when tv speakers are on mute. I have it properly connected to the audio out (line out) and not headphone out, too. If anyone knows of a bluetooth dongle that does not have lag, please let me know,<br /><br />2. Range is limited to the room you are in and it better be small. 10-14 feet maybe, I use a plantronics M50 headset which gives 3 times the range when connected to my notebook pc.  So, if you are expecting to hear the tv when you are in the bathroom - forget it.<br /><br />Other than this, it works great.",3,1

"I live in Florida at the beach so I thought this would be a perfect thing for the beach.  And it does it's job, keeps the sand out.  I definitely would not have it near the water though, it is splash proof only as it says.  The humidity though makes my nook get stuck inside of it when I get home from a few hours of beach time.  And I mean REALLY Stuck, like I had to get someone else to take it out b/c I was getting so aggravated with it.",3,1
"Pros: convenient size, innovative design, great sound, when you plug it in one of the holes, it charges and you don't need batteries.<br /><br />Cons: directions don't specify the charging part, kills battery life immediately, can be a little tedious.",3,1
GPS works good. Other function work good also. Only negative is that the internal battery does not last long. Comes with a car charger and home charger. Not bad for the money.......,3,1
I don't like this cover purely because I HATE the feel of the silicone.  I could only use it for a week or so before it had to come off.  It's my own texture sensitivity that makes me hesitate to recommend it.,3,1
"the color is awesome! that's what earns it 3 stars.  otherwise, it is one of those cases that you have to remove to fully charge because you just can't QUITE get your charger plugged it.  My other issue is the back is this hot purple and then where the case fits around the front, they made it clear...(thankfully I had a purple Sharpie). C'mon sellers...the last 3 items that I have ordered from various sellers have almost been busts!",3,1
Not a very good unit. Sound not good and not easy to get stations.Cd palyer makes alot of noise when using it. Never buy it again,3,2
"I like the included tips for my shure e5c's much better than these (the grey silicone). They isolate better than any other tip on the market aside from molds. But if your ears get warm they get really soft and come out. Then you have to wait until they cool down to put them back in. They also get itchy and make my ears sore, probably because of the heat. My recommendation  is save your money or buy custom molds. These are not worth your money unless you have cold ears all the time  or if you only listen to your music for moments at a time. These would not be good for working out.",3,2
"its cute, but it broke apart two days later....",3,2
"This product replaces the windshield fastener supplied by Easy-Pass which is difficult to remove; it is useful whenever solid windshield attachment is not desirable as for users of lease cars. Unfortunately occasionally the holder comes loose, double suction cups might help. Still, I recommend it!",3,2
"Used on my daughters 8GB zune - worked for about a day, then caused rolling reboots on her zune.   So I attached the zune thru the headphone port (instead of the usb port) and it worked great.  One of the few FM transmitters that actually transmits in stereo.  If it wasn't stereo and died the way it did, I would've given it negative stars.",3,2
"Its a decent quality phone holder. I was very impressed when I got it in but after my first use, the initial impression quickly faded away. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and I understand its a big phone but this case seemed to struggle with sturdiness. It held the phone fine but it was not sturdy at all.<br /><br />Overall I think its a decent holder. The suction cup is very strong and it can hold the phone in various angles.",3,1
Case is very sturdy and nice but the straps are in very awkward spots and will turn the volume up/down or turn the nook off if you are not careful.,3,1
It works but barely.  I got this for my LifeProof case.  I had to tweak the holder on the iHome docking station to make it fit.  Would of been happier with a long cord adapter but could not find one the fits LifeProof cases.,3,1
"Hello, I've owned TruePower battery backup for 88 days. Over all, it needs more R&D. It's a beast. Charge it and it'll charge iPhone in twenty minutes, X2 and 1/2 times. It has a bright light for pictures. It's design helps pull in calls(the first call i made to my dad he said'\\""Wow this call is crystal clear!\\""...But like poison medicine it shorted out my $630.00 iPhone. All of it's shortcomings could have been figured out if there was more R&D. The scenario plays out like this. The plastic that holds the phone will crack and can not hold the phone tightly. The phone needs to be tight in the plug otherwise the phones hardware will short rendering it parts. FYI I've looked all over for an iPhone and can only find a 599.00 and 699.00. That is a lot for money for tiered looking phone. All in all it was great attempt sadly it's at the cost of my dear iPhone.",3,1
its an ok case the case doesnt fit properly at all but it will do just very hard to get the hole to line up with the headphone jack and the strap is fine,3,2
"Item came promptly and as described. I does work for my Zune and my boyfriend's iPod, but it does have a muffled sound. Like radio quality sound. It gets the job done and you can't beat the price.",3,1
"The silicone sleve is hard to beat for the price. i bought this for my husband and he could wear the arm band on his wrist so that was disappointing, we used another arm band so he can wear this to the gym. We should have just got the protective skin for the fuze.",3,1
Turned out not to be the problem so I can't really give a review ???,3,2
"Good finishing and appearance.<br />All connector match with my car.<br />But the software/firmware must be improved.<br />And the power amplifier has cutted from lower frequencies, it's sounds without deeper bass. The internal equalizer sounds dirty.<br />I suggest the use of an external power amplifier.",3,1
"Cute little gadget. It is a comparatively fast and sensitive little Bluetooth GPS unit with a tiny display that can show Lat/Lon/Alt/Speed/Compass/etc. and has a backlight. It will also automatically or manually log waypoints and routes with a modest number of configurable options. It works great with my Treo 680 Smartphone and DeLorme Street Atlas USA 2006 Handheld Edition. In fact it is more reliable than my DeLorme Bluetooth GPS's. Running 12 hours on an alkaline AA battery is rather amazing. The fact that the accompanying software can export the saved waypoint and route data in a number of formats, including NMEA and Google Earth KMZ format is cool. The software is a bit primative but it seems to work. I hope they come out with some updates.<br /><br />Now for the negatives.<br /><br />The USB driver doesn't seem to work properly on XP!!!<br /><br />It seems to work okay on Win2K Pro.<br /><br />Fortunately it is possible to connect your XP PC and the data download software to the M-241 over Bluetooth and get the data off of it. Slowly.<br /><br />And Holux Technical Support (email to China) seems to be strictly a one-way communication medium. You send them emails and nothing ever comes back.<br /><br />Would I buy it again? Yes! It's cheap and works great as an amazingly sensitive and fast little GPS. And if you can negotiate the usual quirks and user hostility of Bluetooth, you can make it do everything that Holux promises it can do. However it sure would be nice if Holux fixed the stupid USB driver for XP!<br /><br />-Christopher Erickson",3,1
"Subs sound great, but I bought a planet audio bb2400.1 for them. I took the visonik amp the package came with and put it on my my two pioneer 10's. Amp kinda sucks. But the subs are decent.",3,1
So far so good,3,1
"I purchased my Literati last spring. The company I work for marked them down to $39.99, from $129.99 and it was an offer not to be refused. Before I bought it I was not really impressed with e-readers. I like books, actual paper, the library is my second home. But I bought one, and I was surprised that I liked it. Most of my co-workers bought them and shortly after returned them because of the \\""quirks\\"". It sometimes doesn't want to turn on-so you have to plug in the power cord and press the reset button. Sometimes it wont let me open library books I've downloaded, or most of the books I have downloaded disappear. When that happens you have to reset to factory settings and re-download the library books and other ones stored on my computer. Since I paid a fraction of the suggested manufacture price, I can live with these quirks. Not everybody can and don't expect any tech support help if you call Sharper Image, one of my friends did because hers wouldn't turn on and the guy told her he didn't know what what cause that and she should just take it back to where she bought it. So the moral is if you can find it super cheap, it is worth the quirks for a \\""starter e-reader\\""",3,2
Just needed a player for listening to some audio book type material. Only complaint is that I don't seem to be able to easily replay some important passages when I want to. Instead the player tends to want to start back at track 1. Will take the time to read the instructions. I don't always do that anymore as most newer electronics are more intuitive.,3,1
"I own an earlier version of this product. It was wonderful while it lasted for 3 months. Even though it had a one year warranty the shop I bought it from refused take a look at it saying the original owner I bought it from is out of town (2-3 months) <br />The manufacturer itself is in China, and replied I should take it to the seller, to use the warranty and get it fixed. <br />Please check out on the warranty and understand what to do in case of failure, since the manufaturer is not in USA.",3,2
"This case is a good value and will protect the screen from scratches and the player from falls.  Using it is a trade off though:  It makes the biggest, bulkiest mp3 player in recent memory even bulkier.      If you love your Zen and size and style is not a concern, by all means buy this case because if you were to drop it and damage it, Zen Vision: M's are hard to find nowadays.  For most people though, the Zen Vision: M is an out-of-date product that is reaching the end of its life-cycle, and dropping and breaking it would just mean they could buy a newer, smaller, flashier Zen Xi-Fi or a Zune.",3,1
"So I got a nook for Christmas and I wanted a cover for it.  When I tried to put this on the nook, it is I want to so lose on it.  It does not \\""hug\\"" the product as it should.  I was hoping that it would shrink down a little after if was put on but has not.  Oh, and it catches lint and hair like a magnet.  It is a cute color, though.  And it does what it is suppose to by covering the actually nook.",3,2
"It took me a while to realize that i have to take my entire case off just to push it in to turn it on...which is kind of a bummer. But the sounds pretty good, as good as 7$ will get ya!👍 I recommend it",3,1
Just opened the box and there are no instructions inside...REALLY?,3,2
The whole audio system works fine and i didn't notice any issue with it. But when i am in the car it keeps on sending a phone book access request to the phone and if you are in the call or playing music it halts for a sec and again resumes. the interval of this request is frequent for every 5 min and it is annoying .,3,1
"This cable failed to connect after initially connecting. Only saw alarms and engine modules once, no others were recognized. Only works with earliest version of Durametric 3.xxx Save your money for the real deal.",3,2
I bought this to replace my standard XM little magnet antenna which was 7 years old on my big Fed Ex style step van. It is well made and the hardware is very good quality. It mounted to the mirror as it should and looks very professional. Honestly I still get a lot of breaking in signal because of trees and bridges and other things. I was hoping to cut down on that but that's New England for you. It comes with a lot of extra antenna lead and is water resistant. I just wish I could tell the difference in reception between the little factory magnetic antenna and this high grade professional one.,3,1
"Warning: The antenna I received was shorted internally between the telescoping poles. Check the antenna with a DVM or Ohm meter BEFORE you hook it to your transmitter. The \\""extension\\"" cable was so tightly bound that one of the loops was collapsed ruining any chance for constant impedence and efficiency it might have had before it was packaged.<br />Performance: Once the internal sort was eliminated, I set the length of each telescoping leg of the diapole to the length called out by the included table and fired up my 0.5 Watt FM transmitter. I did not use the extension cable and replaced the F-to-BNC connector with an F-to-TNC connector for my transmitter. Everything worked quite well.<br />Summary: Using a rabbit ears TV antenna for this purpose is clever, though I expected something \\""more.\\"" Hey, it works once you have eliminated any shorts and tossed out the crushed extension cable. I reported both of these short comings to the supplier and hopefully they will check their inventory more carefully.",3,1
"I bought this for one reason - I wanted a nice, inexpensive MP3 player that was portable enough to take with me to the gym and on my walks. I purchased it for $20 at Big Lots, and do have some positives to say about it. First, the armband feature is great - it works very well for wearing the device during workouts. Second, I have been able to load a lot of audio onto the device and to categorize it in folders. Third, it holds a charge pretty well. Fourth, the sound quality is fine also.<br /><br />One annoying feature is that you can't stop a track and then resume it where you stopped. It will resume only if the battery dies during playing. I love to listen to audiobooks, and having the ability to go back and finish an incomplete chapter would be nice.<br /><br />The primary downside with this device is the touch screen, which is very clumsy. The icons are small, and it always seems to take more than one push to bring up the secondary menu. If you are walking, you will have to stop and really mash your finger onto the specific icon you want in order to get a response. On the main \\""settings\\"" menu there is a way to set the time and date, but I have yet to be able to get this to change correctly. My player still thinks it's 2007, and I suppose I'll have to live with that.<br /><br />The most annoying part of dealing with this touch screen is it's clumsiness when it comes to changing the volume. There is a microscopically small speaker icon in the upper right corner of the touch screen. If you need to adjust the volume, you have to smash a very well placed fingertip directly onto this icon; a millimeter off and you have either turned off the player, changed the program or done something other than what you intended. Changing the volume can become an all day event.<br /><br />I've also had problems with charging the device. Most of the time, the \\""charging\\"" screen will come up as it's supposed to, but there have been times when I've plugged it in and it goes directly to the player screen and won't take a charge, even with the battery is very low.<br /><br />You will also want to invest in a better pair of earbuds. What comes with the machine aren't all that comfortable and the cord is flimsy. I found a heftier pair on sale at a \\""big box\\"" electronics store for 5.00. Well worth the investment.<br /><br />The bottom line here is that if you want an MP3 player that is inexpensive, portable and one that you won't mind losing or breaking, this will fit the bill. I had no problems with my ASUS laptop recognizing it as a device, have been able to transfer audio easily and to delete it just as easily and have not had a problem with playback.",3,1
This ipod cable for hyundai I have just received today 4/7/12. It works but major downside it does not charge my Iphone 4S it really sucks for that reason besides that i like it music plays well control is simple,3,2
"It's cute, but the stylus holder started ripping out after about a week.  I'm not impressed with the quality.  I have one of those ones that came package with a bunch of other accessories for $10 that is better.  If I had to do it over again, I would have gone with a RooCase.",3,1
"While this product did not come with instructions, I was finally able to figure it out, only to discover my car stereo already has bluetooth built-in, so it wasn't needed.  A friend set that all up for me.  So now, I'm going to connect the Breett to my home stereo as soon as I get the cable I need.  For the very-short time I used the Breett in my car, it seemed to work as advertised.",3,2
Not quite what I was anticipating from the description. Earpiece does not fit properly. Looking for something else to use.,3,2
"Neat design, stylish and modern, but - there are only a few charging cords that will fit into the tiny space offered by the cord holder, and without the cord holder, your phone just kind of balances there. It is difficult to see to plug in the phone because the phone connection is at the bottom, and the cord sits down below inside the circle, so I was almost scratching my phone trying to get it plugged in. I ended up buying a rabbit stand for my bedside table, because you can set the phone in it in a landscape setting, and it is secure. I use this one now at my desk, because it is usually light there, and I can see when I plug it in. You cannot have your GS 3 sit sideways in this stand because the port is on the bottom of the phone.",3,1
not the easiest to apply as the ismooth protectors for the iphone,3,2
"THIS IS NOT AN EVERYDAY ALL-PURPOSE IPOD SKIN!  I read that it came with an armband, but have never had one before so didn't know that it means the back side of the skin has 2 big open slits for the band to go through.  Also - this is more for the iPhone because there is a big open spot for where the camera is, so it's useless for the iPod as dirt and other stuff will get in it where all the open spots are!   It is just cheap flimsy rubber, definitely what you get for $0.99. But it would still protect it, but would be helpful if it was a FULL skin.   So if that's what you're looking for, this item is NOT it. I wasted $7 in shipping costs to find that out.",3,2
Received the order but instead of the HDMI cable to connect the blackberry and a TV I received a regular cable to connect a dvd player.  Not at all what was expected and this was the main item I was looking for.  What a bummer!!!!!,3,2
"Perhaps it really is junk?  With all the negative reviews I figured it might be worth the small money to try a dash cam out.  This is the 2nd one I've purchased (and returned).  Why?  BOTH were clearly used prior to me getting them.  Dirty, fingerprints all over, scratches.  One was already in English yet all the reviews here say one of the biggest problems is the manual and the default language it comes in.  I want to verify with everyone that these do indeed need a MICRO SD card, so don't bother with anything else.  I was upset that i got used the first time and ordered a new one the same day I processed the first return.  Today I open the box and though it's clearly not the same one I sent back, this too is used and missing the HDMI cable.  I think what happened is with all the bad reviews people are likely sending them back and the sellers are just restocking their shelves.  Too bad too, because I was looking forward to using this.  Now I'm skeptical about trying another, slightly higher priced one.  Does higher price mean better quality?  Maybe I'll find out.",3,2
"This case is nice and simple.  Doesn't snap all the way together on the sides, but it hasn't come off.",3,2
"I had a few issues with this player when I got it, but I'm liking it more as I use it. It comes with no software or instructions. You have to look it all up online. Had to get Windows Media Player 11 to download anything to it. Nothing else seemed to work. The case it comes in with the band isn't the greatest - it flops around on your arm - but it's easy to use.  If it continues to behave itself I think I'll keep it. :-)",3,2
"Well, in the beginning it was a great case cover, however, the bling begins to fall out at some point. So, in the end you end up carrying a not so cute cover.",3,1
It's ok. I guess I was hoping for more. But maybe this is great for mini speakers. It doesn't sound good at hight volume but it's fine at mid volume. Doesn't bounce around which is great.,3,2
"I usually prefer logictech over other brands as their product quality is one of the best and so is their customer service. But the reason for the 3 star rating is that...<br /><br />1. For Seller/Provider: The refurbished item have lot of scratches on the back of the speaker :( (I know I cannot complaint about scratches for a refurbished product, but my earlier refurbished product purchase were in really good condition)<br /><br />2. For Product: This is for the product. The speaker and sound quality is very good compared to other dock speaker out in the market as long as it is plugged to power. Once you unplug the power, there is a lot of difference in the sound quality.<br /><br />I would suggest this product if you are planning to use it alwayz plugged to power. If you are thinking of using it outdoors or when travelling I would strongly suggest you to look for other products.",3,1
"The PIN will not work whatsoever, and after a couple minutes of playing them with my phone, they start to &#34;skip&#34; like an old record.",3,2
I order this transmitter because i wanted to listen to my ipod in my car and the reception is not clear and I am a little disappointed. I am glad that I did not spend that much money on this because the quality of the music coming through the speakers is very poor.,3,2
"I love electronics, I really do.  I have a lot of high end audio equipment.  I previously bought an inexpensive Bluetooth table radio.  I enjoyed the Bluetooth feature which let me stream from my iPhone, and thought I would get a nicer radio for the bedroom and bought this one.  I am not sure it does anything better than the inexpensive one.<br /><br />My first complaint is that it sounds nothing like flat (and I know how flat should sound).  I find the bass is painfully exaggerated when playing at low levels.  I suspect I can adjust it somehow but turning off XFi and Crystalizer features hasn't done it.<br /><br />There are no hardware preset buttons.  When I tried to set FM presets through the touch screen interface, I could only set 8.  The manual says up to 10 radio presets can be set so maybe 2 are reserved for AM.  Anyway, 10 is not very many.  I was able to set Internet radio station presets but changing between Internet radio presets is ridiculously hard. You should be able to just press channel up on the remote but instead you have to face the radio to go through a bunch of menus.  You have to go to a main menu, select stations, then favorites, then there is another folder, then you can finally see all your presets, toggle through them, and select one.  All while cranking your neck to see what you are doing.<br /><br />If you have a smart phone, and most people do, you could just use the Bluetooth function and use your phone to control Pandora, any Internet radio app, or your own music.  So that begs the question--if you already have Pandora, iHeart radio, tunein radio, and your own music on your phone, do you really need to have these features repeated in the table radio?  Maybe all you really need is Bluetooth.  If the radio had a sensible way to switch between Internet radio stations, and maybe even some hardware preset buttons, it would be convenient to have the functions in the radio in case you need to walk away and take your phone with you.  But youare usually using the table radio in the morning or at night.<br /><br />Another thing that is somewhat bothersome is that the only connector is the iPhone 4 type.  My low end table radio has a USB port which lets me charge my iPhone 5 or any other phone.<br /><br />So, overall, I am not sure it was a wise purchase.",3,1
Cover okay but you can't bend it back so it's like holding a book. Covers book well and makes it easy to carry in your purse.,3,1
"Update: 7/21/2013<br />I received a replacement from the Manufacturer (even though I purchased the cam on ebay).  The cam I bought was defective (apparently).  The replacement works a little better than the first cam which is why I upped it to 3 stars.<br />The camera is a \\""wide angle\\"" lens so it makes thing looking further away that it really is.  Which also makes reading the plates harder.<br /><br />However, I can not read the plates for the most part.  Except for sunny days where my windshield glares up.  I either need to buy some type of carpet dash mat to prevent the glare or purchase a $30 polarizing lens for the camera.<br /><br />This unit still runs warm.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy for what it is.  A dash cam.  No need to record super HD quality.  Even though it's supposedly a 1080P dash cam, the video seems choppy like a hidden security cam the bank uses.  Except this records in color. I've seen some Chinese branded dash cam that seems to actually record HD video. (DOD dash cams) for example.<br /><br />-------------------<br /><br />This camera is not worth it.  It cannot focus on any license plate.  (US License plates).  For a $300 dash cam, you would think they would include a quality lens.  Instead of some cheap crappy pos lens.  This camera also runs very hot.  Everyone who has own this and the previous model can admit that the SD card will not last long at all.  Simply because the heat will cause the SD card to burn itself out.<br /><br />The SD card also runs very hot.  Almost to hot to hold after use.  Whats even worst than the camera itself?  The customer service from both Pittasoft and their authorized distributor.  Virtually ZERO feedback after several emails.<br /><br />There are better cams out there.",3,2
"This kit looks really nice until you try to do anything with it.  NONE OF THE PICTURES IN THE MANUAL ARE CLEAR ENOUGH TO SEE WHERE TO PLUG THINGS IN.  They promise more information on a web site that doesn't exist.  How many bright-eyed bushy tailed newbies have they frustrated and turned away?<br /><br />However, my seller, RobotSimple, saved the day.  On a Saturday, no less.  They set me a link to a pdf of the manual that can be blown up enough to clearly see the diagrams.  The pdf is on the SparkFun website.  I am not sure it will make it through Amazon editing, but here it is:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I recommend buying this from RobotSimple if possible.",3,1

The sound quality deserve 5 stars.<br />- Design:<br />It looks really good and rugged I give it that. it fits perfectly for a bicycle, and it comes with a hook to attach it to a backpack. (I love the bright orange color)<br />- Water resistance IPX3:<br />This is why I gave it 3 stars, even though the speaker is advertised as &#34;IPX3 waterproof&#34; it did not pass my water proof test. once I splashed it with a little of water the speaker start it to act up and make weird noises and eventually powered of and I have not been able to turned it back on. Keep in mind I know exactly the waterproof/water Resistance IP codes means since I have tested many products before.<br /><br />- Rugged?<br />Yes it was actually shock proofed enough to withstand a drop from few feet without breaking.<br /><br />SHOULD YOU BUY IT????<br />If you are looking for a good sound quality speaker with a builtin battery to charge your devices then I would say YES, however the waterproof is not as advertise and if you are looking for something more outdoorish I would try something else.<br /><br />The product was sent to me in exchange for an unbiased honest review.",3,1

"When being removes for cleaning the first time, the case snapped at the top. I would have hoped it would last longre than two months!",3,1
"Purchased this key blank/remote combo for use with a 2005 Chrysler Pacifica.  The blank is about 5mm longer than the stock key.  Getting the blank cut was challenging.  The local big box hardware stores have converted to automated key machines so providing your own blank is not an option.  My local mom-and-pop store uses older clamp-style cutters which cause problems due to the shape of the blank.  They were able to get it done, but it required them to mount the blank and key backwards and use a micormeter to adjust the position of the blank within the holder.  Even then, the key works fine for my ignition, but will not work for the door locks.  Overall, the quality of this case is poor.  The metal ring is loose in the plastic housing and has a nasy internal edge.  The ink of the pads wears off in a month and the raised nubs on the lock button wore to the point that I could not feal them in about the same amount of time.  The body of the case is thicker than the stock key cases so the original pad cannot be properly used.  The Chrylser emblem for the back of the case is included, but the tape is junk and it did not stick for more than a day.  For the price, it's an okay case and the ability to stow the key when the case is in my pocket is nice but I would not buy it again.",3,2

I highly recommend using a phono cable if you have the option versus using the receiver.",3,2
"When my daughter got her iPod Touch 4G, she purchased this screen saver. I thought it looked pretty cool, so when I got my own iPod Touch 4G, I bought the same screen saver. Now, 4 months later, I am less enamored with this screen saver. It works fine as a reflective surface and screen saver. Unfortunately, when you are outside or in a bright light atmosphere, the reflective surface actually works against you. In order to see what is behind the screen saver, meaning what is on your iPod screen, you have to adjust the brightness setting of the iPod to maximum brightness. This in turn shortens the battery life and you have to recharge sooner. Eventually, I will replace this screen saver with a clear one.",3,2

Product worked as advertised but I tried to use it to convert some language tapes to MP3 and ended up with too much background noise. To be fair the tapes have lots of pauses and blank sections where it is easy to pick up noise. It may work fine for music.

They accepted the return with no hassle so rest assured that if you do buy the product and it doesn't work for you that you can return it.,3,2

"Well I figured I just had to have a new alarm clock for my iPhone.  I had been using an iHome Alarm with an adapter and was very happy to see this one on the market.  However, in practice I was not that thrilled with it.  It's kinda like an old $10. alarm from Radio Shack.  It works but nothing about it really stands out as excellent.  The iPhone 5 does fit into the connector and the alarm comes with a support bracket to help alleviate some of the pressure on the plug which is a great idea.  Did I mention the alarms, radio, etc. all work?  Yes, they all do.<br />However, to plug in the iPhone takes some work and does not fit so smoothly. (I came to appreciate the recessed area of my iHome alarm that causes the iPhone to just fit perfectly as it guides you in)  In fact I prefer using the adapter on my old alarm to inserting the iPhone into this alarm as its just easier and smoother. I mentioned that $10. Radio Shack alarm?  That's about the quality of the sound that this produces and the glaring red light is also akin to that old $10. alarm.  Overall a functional product but if you like a better sound quality and better engineered products as I have become accustom too I would suggest you wait for the iHome version.",3,1
"This is cheaper alternative to the more expensive ipods but it's small and hard to see the screen so don't use it for video.  The screen cover scatches very easily and also prevents easy viewing of the screen contents.  I have an older model and wanted this one due to increased memory capacity.  This version is really cheap and low quality with regard to the case, buttons and earphones (the earbuds are terrible!) but that is reflected in the price.  It is easy to download music to but not easy to rearrange once it's downloaded.  I wouldn't buy it knowing what I know now and f I'd looked at in a store first, I would've known that it's a major drop in quality compared to what Sony used to produce.",3,1

"You should really put this on in a dust free clean room. No wonder they give you multiple shields. The slightest dust particle creates a bubble. I am not sure if other products are just as difficult to put on.   I later learned that the front glass on the IPhone is pretty strong and difficult to scratch. I was told the scratch shield is more important to have on the other side for the camera and flash.  Anyway, the screen is good if you can put it on correctly. Otherwise, I hope you can live with little bubbles.",3,1
"I bought this radio because I use my phone for my primary music source in the car, and also want to be able to effectively comply with the hands-free phone rules in many places...  I've been using this stereo for nearly three months now.  Good:  This stereo looks great, has customizable color settings which allow you to either match it to your car, or add a little individual flair.  There are two USB ports on the stereo, but don't get too excited about this: if you want to use the BlueTooth feature you will constantly occupy one of those ports with the included USB BlueTooth receiver.  It's tiny and unobtrusive on the front panel, which allowed me to run the rear USB port (on its ~3' cord) into my center console beneath the trim for a very clean look.  The included microphone has a cord that is plenty long enough to route under the dash and around the window for mounting the microphone above the rear-view mirror.  Operation is fairly easy, too.  With an iPod the controls are fairly intuitive, I did not need the manual to figure it out.  The controls also work well for both the A2DP (BlueTooth music controls) and BlueTooth phone calls.  You can even dial numbers that are not in your phone book using the front panel, but this is enough of a hassle I wouldn't do it regularly.  All told, you can leave the phone in a belt holster or purse and operate most, if not all, of what you need to from the stereo.  Bad:  I don't know if it is just where my microphone is placed, or it the microphone is bad, but when placing hands-free calls using the speakerphone function through the stereo, those on the other end say I am very difficult, if not impossible to understand.  If a different placement or replacement microphone correct this issue, I will update this review.  Conclusion:  Overall, I find this was an excellent purchase, despite not being able to use the speakerphone feature.  If this is very important to you, you might want to consider a different unit than this one.  Personally, I listen to music on my phone through BlueTooth a LOT, while I take very few calls in the car, so this isn't a dealbreaker for me - only a mild dissapointment.",3,1

"The first year I owned my Kindle I used a padded mailing envelope as a case.  It worked great for protecting the Kindle when not in use, but wasn't real helpful as a case to use when reading the Kindle.  I finally decided to spend the money on a case.    This case was advertised as a leather case though with a price that seemed - well - suspect for real leather (not to mention multiple reports that stated the case was not true leather).  Despite that, I purchased.    Having now used the case for several weeks, I can report on its pros and cons.  Positives:  -- Getting the Kindle in or out of the case is simple  -- Plug in slot on the bottom of the Kindle is easily accessible  -- The case is easy to hold; the book style of it makes it comfortable to use  -- Case looks nice  -- Pockets on the right side of the case  -- Can easily fold the left side of the case back, allowing for an easy one hand hold.    -- Weight and size is excellent - the Kindle is protected but still light to handle  Cons:  -- It's not real leather. Why oh why does the seller feel they have to lie?  The price of the case is not commensurate with what the true leather cases costs.  Why not say the case is made from a high-quality vinyl (which it is)?  In fact, I would have given a 4-star rating to this case had it been honestly described.  The vinyl is good quality, feels fine, wipes clean and is pleasant to hold.  -- The Kindle slides - just a little - but enough to be annoying. It slips to the left - just a little - making it hard to see the full screen.  I have to push it back in about every half hour.  -- The page turners on the left side of the Kindle are hard to reach unless the holder is folded back  So - in summary - it's a decent case and worth the money - but why oh why does the seller feel the need to lie in the description?",3,1
was a very good product wish there was more description about the product,3,1

"I'm not much of an audiophile, so I don't feel comfortable commenting on this unit's sound quality when it comes to highs, mids, and lows. But for an average listener this little speaker sounds great! I really love how loud this speaker can get since I use it mostly in noisy environments (delivery truck with no radio). It's also very easy to use and I love the style, design, and build quality of this unit. I haven't used this unit long enough to comment on battery life, but I was able to listen to streaming radio through my phone's bluetooth at max volume for about 4 hours without it dieing.<br /><br />There is one major issue I have with this speaker, however. When I first turned on the device I noticed a constant quite static noise coming through the speakers. Adjusting the volume doesn't affect the level of the noise. It's there when connected via bluetooth or auxiliary. This static noise makes listening to the unit at low volumes in quite environments very irritating. I've noticed a few other people on the internet comment about this same static/white noise problem so I'm not sure if this is a quality control issue or what. So I think instead of bothering with exchanging this speaker, and risk getting another unit with the same issue, I may just return it for a refund.",3,1
"Then it's a good cable, and ridiculously cheap.<br /><br />I've bought two of these (one for office and one for home, both plugging into an older iHome) and they charge my new iPhone 5s.<br /><br />And when the 2nd one seemed to get lost in shipping the company quickly resolved the issue by sending a replacement out right away.",3,2
I was looking to replace the HK speakers in my e46 BMW. I put the reference series MB quarts in my last BMW and they sounded pretty good so I figured these would too. I got them installed and like them OK.  The tweeters are very strong the sound come out bright and high. I just have them installed with the rest of the factory speakers so that might be the problem.     All in all they sound pretty good especially for the price I paid here ($88.00). They would sound great in a smaller care by themselves with a subwoofer. I think if I could do it over I would go with the Q series but I am very picky about sound quality.,3,1
"I purchased these speakers for my 10 year old daughter, for Christmas, to use in her bedroom, connected to different mobile devices. I had trouble getting them to put out enough volume to get the water to dance inside the speakers. I've found that iPhones do not put out a strong enough signal to get the water to dance, even with an inline booster on the stereo mini jack aux cable. Over bluetooth? Forget it. There is hardly any volume coming out of the speakers, no matter what I did, using these speakers with an iphone. However, my ipad & Accer tablet had enough signal to get the speakers to work. Ditto my imac & PC. Still needed the inline booster though. After fooling around with different DJ apps & music creation apps on the ipad & imac, the sounds the speakers like the best, to get the water dancing, were sharp high frequency sounds. Snare drum, cymbals & high hats seem to get the best response. Other high frequency sounds also work well. Vocals, mid-tones & bass... not so much. The overall sound quality is not too good, so don't expect too much. While I was initially disappointed with these speakers, after fooling around with them a bit, they are just alright. Good enough to entertain a child, but adults will tire quickly of the sound and water works.",3,1

"Like another reviewer, I thought the case included a hinged cover for the front touchscreen, just by looking at the main picture. This is not accurate. What you see is one picture of the back piece of the case on the left, then one picture of the front piece of the case on the right. I don't know whether they put these two pictures so close together on purpose, but there's an additional set of pictures that clearly show what the case looks like on the Nano. My bad for not looking at all the pictures I guess. I'm using Klipsch x10i earbuds, and I don't have any problems plugging them in with the case on the Nano. I have no use at all for the sketch stylus pen that's included.",3,2

"I just got it last weekend. Initially I had problem with it because the box wasn't able to output to HDMI. I had to use the AV cable and after passing the setup, the box was able to output to HDMI channel. If I didn't have that problem, I would have given it an extra star. Over all if you are an Asian and wanted to make your visiting relatives felt like home, you can't go wrong with this box.<br /><br />PRO<br /><br />1. Price - Considering this is a nitched product, the price point is ok. I remember reading a review else where complaing of the price point. Given this is a nitched product only the Asians would buy, I don't think the price can get any lower. While the spec/construction maybe similar to that of say Roku2, but I don't see this box getting sold in places like Costco/Sam's or even BestBuy. Until the company can get into the mainstream market, expect to see the price double of Roku. (note: I also own a Roku2)<br /><br />2. Free Channel selection - It has decent channel selections including Taiwan channels I wanted. Granted not a whole lot but beats what I had before. Compare to Dish/Cable, this is the best alternative I can find. Also my package included how to install BETV, but it wasn't necessary. I was able to find BETV and BETV_II and installed it w/o any problem.<br /><br />3. Youtube channel - I missed it since Roku took it off. Given it was built on modified android, it was nice to see youtube.<br /><br />4. Wifi - Yes, it sucks, but useable. I don't want to run a cable through my wall or carpet. I saw some reviewer complaining of slow load speed, but that was due to the server. Even when I am using Netflex via my Roku, it still took a few seconds.<br /><br />5. Local media playback - I had some media files and the playback was decent.<br /><br />CON<br /><br />1. IR remote - Given the box's form factor I had problem maintain line of sight. I wish the next version use bluetooth instead. I don't know what that is going to do to the price point. I have a tv stand cabinet and I would like to hide the cable clutter and make the box invisible like I did with my Ruko box. It was interesting the game remote uses wireless usb, why not do something similar instead of bluetooth and ditch the IR.<br /><br />2. Additional/Private Channels - Granted it seems a lot at first, but most of the channels have limited selection and searches are hard to use. I would love to see PPS, Hulu (regular not plus) getting added. I wonder how hard is it to code my own channel.<br /><br />3. Android package support - It would be nice if it could support apk files.<br /><br />4. Local Wireless streaming - I would like to see an app that can help me stream local media from my server like PLEX.",3,1
"I received this as a Christmas present (I had picked it out) and had to wait 2 weeks to have it installed. The installer did a good job wiring the unit and the installation went great but then using the unit became a nightmare from there on out.<br /><br />Let me start by saying i love JVC and have never had any issues with them or any other stereo maker for that matter.<br /><br />The first thing that happened was I couldn't get the unit out of Demonstration mode. No matter what the installer (Alex) and I did, it just would not leave demo mode. We cut the power to it and finally we were able to get it into \\""production mode\\"". But, the problem then was I had this blue bar with white letters that said \\""Production mode\\"" in the top middle of the display. It took us a while to figure out that we had to put it in Demo mode (which scared us so understand why it took us a while to try this) and then put it back into Production mode for the \\""Production mode\\"" bar to go away.<br /><br />We switch to the tuner and preset some stations and i notice that when we choose a station that the information didn't display about the artist, album, or song. After messing with some of the options, yeah, you could see SOME of the information but it was absolutely HORRIBLE for information.<br /><br />We switched to the SD card (32gb) and the card was found and read easily enough (took about 10 to 15 seconds to read the card and start playing a song). The information for the song would come up (i.e. Artist, Album, Album Art, and Song) and then after 10 seconds it would disappear. WTF?! So i dig through settings and even break out the owners manual and NOTHING i did would make the information display constant. Plus, if the information disappeared the only way you could get it back would be to wave your hand in front of the sensor or touch the screen. So if a new song started playing the unit will not display the information unless you wave your hand in front of the sensor or touch the screen.<br /><br />Now, i don't know about anyone else but I like to see the information about the music I'm listening to especially if I'm listening to the radio and hear a song or a new artist. I like to be able to just glance over at the radio and make a mental note to check it out later. I shouldn't have to touch the screen or activate the sensor to see that information.<br /><br />Everything else (as far as i could tell) works well on the unit. The Bluetooth was a pain to deal with initially but that ironed itself out after we got it out of the \\""Production Mode\\"" blue bar screen. When it was stuck with that blue bar it would make my Galaxy S3 \\""Droid!\\"" about every 2 to 3 minutes to let you know it had connected. That \\""Droid!\\"" is the same alert that i have for text messages so i was constantly pulling my phone out to see if i had a text and .. nothing.<br /><br />It will take quite a while to play with this unit and figure it out if you're going to keep it, which i am not. There was an audible HISS through the unit when the volume was at 00 that drove me nuts as well. For now, i'll go back to my stock unit until I find another head unit that's worth buying.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone to keep from making the mistake i did.<br /><br />Jim<br />Nashville, TN",3,2

"Once again, Baofeng has changed the plastic mold and simply repackaged a UV-5R radio.  Sure they changed the antenna (which is better) and tweaked the keyboard (the zero is finally in the correct place), and the radio fits in your hand better (at least for most), but everywhere else where it really counts it's simply a repackaged UV-5R.<br /><br />Not that most of you will take apart your new UV-82 radio and compare it to the various models of the UV-5R that are available, but this radio has the same circuit board and the same standard battery capacity, although Baofeng has now come up with another little &#34;trick&#34; to make you think the radio is better there, too.  They simply relabel the battery with anything from 1800mAh, or 2000mAh, or even 3000mAh with a label - all with the same number and same type of battery cells inside the pack.<br /><br />So those of you that fall into the trap of purchasing this week's &#34;new and improved&#34; UV-82L model (vs. last week's &#34;older&#34; UV-82 model) have the exact same radio, with the exact same battery, but your battery label is different.  Again, let me make sure you understand, the only difference between the UV-82 and and UV-82L is the battery label, not the battery itself.  Feel better about purchasing the &#34;new and improved&#34; UV-82L model yet?<br /><br />Again, many &#34;questionable&#34; sellers will try just about anything to convince you to purchase a newer or improved model of anything, even when it really isn't what they claim it to be.  The UV-82 series of radios DOES NOT replace the UV-5R series, nor does it replace the UV-B5/B6 series of radios, Baofeng is simply adding additional models to the product line up, not replacing them.<br /><br />One dealer (that was removed from Amazon) even went so far as to claim they were the sole U.S. distributor for Baofeng, making all sorts of outrageous claims about how many radios they sold on any given day, how all other U.S. dealers purchased Baofeng radios through them, or even how Baofeng makes radios exclusively for them.<br /><br />Here's a secret I'm sure the &#34;distributor in KY&#34; doesn't want known.  If you (and your friends) combine your resources together, you too can purchase directly through Baofeng in China.  In fact, if you can order enough radios at once, you can pick out the design case and even spec in what frequencies or bands you need to be covered.  Most of the claims of &#34;new and improved&#34; features sets are all marketing nonsense, but many of these &#34;questionable&#34; dealers (or distributors) are all desperate to establish a reason why their radio is worth more of your money that 5 to 25 other dealers selling the exact same radio on the exact same website (Amazon, eBay, or whatever).<br /><br />That's precisely why the UV-82 was welcomed by them for a few weeks with open arms.  It looks different enough from a UV-5R that they can actually sell it as a different radio.  Fair enough, but now many of their same competitors are again selling the same UV-82 radio, so what to do?  Get the factory in China to ship a &#34;new&#34; model, call it a UV-82L and claim it has a bigger battery vs. the original UV-82 series.  See a pattern here?<br /><br />No doubt one (or more) of the larger dealers will eventually ask Baofeng to start shipping them in colors, or try to figure out a way to re-engineer a truly larger battery onto it (not available at present), or even slap a different frequency band into the radio (it's basically the same as the UV-5R inside and that's been done before), and presto, we'll have one or two dealers happy for a few months while they claim a &#34;newer or improved&#34; UV-82 XYZ model that &#34;replaces&#34; the old UV-82 and UV-82L units, and of course, their new and improved model will be exclusive to them.<br /><br />I've even see one &#34;questionable&#34; dealer claim that the UV-82 can receive two VHF frequencies and the UV-5R can't, which is absolutely false, they both can by using a scanning trick called dual band receive.  The UV-B5/B6 series still has a much better receiver than either the UV-5R or the UV-82 units, so if that's important to you (and if you live in or near an intermod alley it should be), take a hard look at the UV-B5/B6 units.<br /><br />Frequency and performance wise, the UV-82 series is simply a repackaged UV-5R radio that costs $15 to $20 bucks more than a UV-5R.  Buy the UV-82 radio if you like the design, just don't be led on to believe that this radio's performance destroys the UV-5R (sadly it doesn't, but certainly the better antenna helps, it's just not worth $20 more for it in my opinion).  Forget about many of the UV-5R power options available as well, as they simply aren't available for the UV-82 series (and may never be due to the case design).  Maybe that won't be a problem if a dealer asks Baofeng to re-label the standard battery with a label that claims 10,000mAh or a hidden solar re-charge capability (chuckle)., they both can by using a scanning trick called dual band receive.

"This is the first metronome I have owned. Now I realize I really should have gotten one years ago. I feel like it is already helping me stay on tempo more consistently.  I can't make comparisons with other models but this one seems to be PLENTY LOUD with different choices of the type of click you desire, and with the headphone jack output, you can listen to it through earbuds or feed it into a monitor system in a band setting. Many times our band tends to speed up the tempo, even if only slightly, during a song...this helps you lock in what the tempo should be when you are practicing.    The controls are pretty straight forward and easy to use except for the TEMPO CONTROL WHEEL.  Gee, the only reason I can think of for this engineering oversight is that it fits in a box better? It would work ok if the resistance on the wheel was less. But from the box, you pretty much have to use 2 hands to operate it. I modified it the first day I got it by using super glue gel and a small wire nut to make a tiny knob on the wheel. It works smoothly now because this gives you plenty of leverage to crank it with a finger.    The tap function is nice, just tap the beat as you listen to a song and it computes what the tempo is. It also has a light corresponding to the beat, red on the 1 beat, then green 'til you get back to 1.  This unit may not be as portable as some but it will fit in my guitar case pocket. This is not a concern as I just got it to use at home. The unit can also emit reference pitch tones for tuning or ear training.    If it holds up, I will be satisfied now that it has been \\""customized\\"". As I say, I would rate it higher if not for the control wheel design.",3,1

"The speaker is adorable but the sound quality is mediocre--hollow, tinny, and not very loud at all (even when I up the volume on my devices as far as they can go).  Note that it has no volume control of its own--it's strictly a (crappy) amplifier and speaker unit.<br /><br />On the other hand, it's quite cute, and looks great sitting on the back of my toilet while I shower.  Meaning unless you're a really hardcore hoarder with a Hello Kitty fetish, there are probably better speakers out there.  Worth eleven bucks?  Meh.  Maybe worth five.  Next time I'll buy in Flushing.",3,2
"Awesome color, but about as cheap as the rest of them, the adhesive doesn't stick at all. Wish apple sold these.",3,1
This product works like it is suppose to be there are no instructions included. I've figured out most of the functions but am still working on others.,3,1
"This holder is top heavy, so much so that the weighted dash mount that I have I also use with GPS and it wouldn't stay stuck to that with suction device, kept falling over, the goose neck is also too long, the suction base doesn't stick well at all. I made sure the surface I was trying to use was free of dust, dirt, etc., but still wouldn't stick. Threw it in backseat where it still is today.",3,2
Packed in box loosely with minimal packing material around the sun shade.  Two of four mount clips were broken off.  I ended cutting off the other two clips and mounting it to my GPS face using 3M double back tape.  It did make a huge difference eliminating the sun's glare on the screen.,3,2

I got it fast and good packaging.. but it does not work with all life proof cases. It worked with the iphone 4s case but not with the ipad nuud case.,3,2

"This product is a great idea, but the quality is no so good.  The hardware that holds it to the window and the swiveling hardware is of good quality, but the plastic that holds the \\""plasic holders\\"" that hold the phone or GPS are cheap and break easily.  I had used my mount for a half a dozen times or so when a little piece of plastic from the base broke off and now it only allows one plastic side holder to be functional. The fix?  Better quality, more durable plasic perhaps.  (I was using this product for a cell phone.)",3,1
It is very hard to take off of my iPod Touch but it is very slim. But the kickstand doesn't hold.,3,2
"I just received this cover and I'm not too happy with it.  The inside is black with white stitching, not red as shown in the picture.  The whole inside looks very different and the red portion of the cover is not a rich dark red as shown in the picture but more of a cross between red and hot pink.  Not  the quality of the M-edge covers I have for my PRS 505 but it was much cheaper.  The reader does fit securely in the case.  I would have to ship it back to England to return so I guess I'm stuck with it but I'll be looking for another cover.  Update - I asked for an authorization to return the case and Navitech promptly refunded my payment.  Their customer service is excellent but they need to update the picture so people know what they are ordering and then they wouldn't be dissatisfied with the case they receive.",3,2

"I purchased this for use with my ipod nano 6th gen. I only owned it for a week before returning it. I liked the size and connectivity was good. My main issue with the unit was that is drained my ipod battery like crazy. I listen to music A LOT, so this is a BIG problem. Without the bluetooth adapter, I could get 24 hours of playback on 1 charge, with the bluetooth adapter, it cut my listening time down to 6-8 hours. Maybe the next model they come out with will have better power specs.",3,2
I purchased this item for christmas and have had trouble with it.  I have been unable to use the adapter that came with it to charge it and also when it was received it was not in a box it looked as if someone had already used it.I am not pleased with it at all. I will never purchase from the compnay that supplied this item again.,3,2
"decent piece, but with my ipod touch it is a bit too sensitive and fickle unless kept still it will crackle and or lose one side. so im pretty bummed",3,1
"i brought this because within the last few months I have fallen in love with Cherry blossom tree's.  once I got it, I tried it on my ipod. fits great but the case is a little off the wallet. as if it's not centered right. but other then that it's fine!",3,1

Need a headphone jack.  This radio did not have one. Otherwise the product is very good. Return procedure was smooth.,3,2
have one installed on my wife's vehicle which is why i bought another one... her works fine... this one will not keep date and time set... set the date and time today (AGAIN) and after being off for only an hour date and time was off again.. date a day ahead... time ahead also.... to me it looks it is being set to China time.... this one i would not even use in a accident court case due to improper time..,3,1
"My item came with one defect. No audio on DVD palyback. Otherwise impressive features and functionality.<br /><br />The bigger problem is that another order filled to replace the defective one arrived as different model (they are all generic, no brand no model number. Connections in the back are different, and more importantly cannot be used, in a car having separate amplifier system and 6+1 speakers. The first model did provide for such connections.<br />You get what you pay for",3,2
I like those little speakers,3,1
I GIVE IT A 3 STAR.  Backlight not as bright during the day. Even with full adjustment. Ability to see what’s on the screen is very important. During the day. I recommend Jensen VX7020,3,1
Love the case but has already cracked up by the camera lense where the plastic is thin. Otherwise I love this case.,3,1
"This is a good cam, quality is good, interface is difficult and delete video selection is hard to find, also the camera on back side really stands out, other people will know you have camera because they will see it, other than that, the video quality is great and length of video depends on size of card, it will record for hours.",3,1
"I did not feel it worth the money for this.  The quality of audio is lacking.  It is small, however, which is good. I probably would not have bought one if I knew how it worked.",3,2
"Aukey Muse 2 seems well built and feels premium for the price but returned due to Bluetooth connectivity and horrible voice sounds when connecting devices or turning the speaker on..  The metal like frame, style and weight are nice.  Sound quality on Bluetooth was great and loud when it worked.  Sound was clear and bass was minimum but there.  Using auxiliary was never loud enough for the device I was using to play mp3's with.",3,1
"As I expected, the camera doesn't work and some of the other things.  I use it as an Mp3 player and it works fine for that. I wish the camera worked but this is an old model.<br /><br />Vivian Worrell",3,1
The piece that fits into my ear is just a bit too big and requires the o-ring.  The o-ring fell off at some point and now it is even more uncomfortable.  I have had a cheaper blue tooth with no o-ring that was much more comfortable.  It works fine though as far hearing the other party.,3,1
"but the damn earplugs are a real problem. hear that, nu people? how about a better pair of earplugs?   I had the same problem everyone is reporting-- sound cutting in and out during vigorous swim and now the right one seems to have given up.   what a tease because I sure do love it when it works!!!",3,1
the price is not that low but is well constructed a little bulky but holed the cell phone very well,3,1
nice radio but the receve breaks up on strong singals. cant seem to over come it. would not buy again.,3,2
"It was to big for my arm if you are thin and don't have to much arm muscle this is not for you it keeps sliding off my arm, But if you have bigger arms than me its a VERY nice product kinda hard to use the touch screen but i really liked it.",3,1
"I purchased this little speaker system to enhance the audio on a 29&#34; flat screen TV, so 45 watts constituted a decent upgrade. I later connected a dvd player, and android tv box.The front panel and displays seem dated but otherwise the unit is attractive enough. The remote was definitely added as an afterthought it was set at the same frequency as the remote to my TV box. Every time that I clicked an icon on the TV the speakers would power up/down or change modes! (switching to a 2.4G wireless mouse solved my problem). The decibel level doesn't get too high but the overall sound quality is good. Nice little versatile speaker system if you're not expecting too much.",3,1
"sound quality really good, audio is really loud for its size, design really nice, bass really noticeable, i had 2 problems, one is that the cord has a really cheap feel and the volume switch started to give trouble in the first use out of the box and i didn't get the carrying case. A suggestion is that to enable it with bluetooth, fix the volume switch and do something about the cords its a bit of a clutter to have and then it would give the competition a run for their money.",3,1
"All of the screen protectors are very useful. The Wireless radio broadcast unit is useful, but the unit is poorly made. The jack has a connection problem, and the audio quality is not that great. The rest of the Items are neat, but not very useful in most situations. I would recommend this to a friend, But would rather go out and buy a new radio for my car with the ipod jack.",3,1
"Considering it is a waterproof device, you have to accept some limitations. I use it for paddleboarding, so I don't submerge the device, nor do I wear the earplugs underwater. I have had it underwater (going thru a wave)for a few seconds. It continues to work. Ear plugs are fine. Sound is ok. Controls can be difficult, but that is because it's water tight, so what can you do. I have not had any trouble with it. It serves it's purpose.",3,1
This is a nice looking case but has a few issues that detracts from its overall quality.  The case is loose and allows the iPod Touch to move about such that the camera gets blocked by the case when taking pictures.  Another issue with this case is that the sides overlap the screen a bit preventing you from easily access the far left or far right of the screen.  A bit annoying.    Could it be that this case is better suited for the iPhone rather than an iPod Touch?  I wouldn't know since I have a Touch and the case is advertised for a Touch.    The case is attractive and well put together but having to double check the camera placement and always having to check if I pressed the correct side keys is a bummer.  Slows me down and ruins the flow.    A couple of improvements and this would be 5-star.,3,1
Arrived fast. Not much damage. Only a few dings on corners. No biggy. The left subwoofer was siezed and wouldnt move.,3,2
it's does not come painted. the fit its ok. it feels loose when you install it.,3,2
Will it in a 2000 mustang?,3,1
"I bought the case specifically because of the stand so that I could set the iPod on the tray on an airplane and watch movies. It does succeed in that task. However, the part of the case that flips open to create the stand is somewhat flimsy. The plastic is certainly strong enough to support the iPod, but it relies on small nubs of plastic as hinges and that's where the problem lies. Because the plastic is so rigid, it is sometimes difficult to open and close. Opening the stand will almost tear it off. Once opened, it works well but be cautious to not put any weight at all on the top of the iPod. It wasn't designed for that, of course, and it won't take it. On a plane, just handing things across seats can cause you to accidentally place weight on the top of the iPod and the stand will break. I was successful for about a year protecting the stand so that it wouldn't break, but it finally did. I'm not even sure when it occurred, but I found the broken stand when I went to use it next. What I find really curious about the case is that it broke at the base next to the data connector and on the side next to the buttons. Since the case hugs the iPod pretty darn well, I think it is poor workmanship that the edges broke near the openings. I have been rather gentle with my iPod and it's case. However, I need a new case and I will be looking for one that is sturdier.",3,2
"This was one of those accessory packages for the Zune player (anyone still have one of these?) that had about everything a person would need to use the Zune player at home or in an automobile. It was very &#34;economical&#34; so the product quality is marginal but the products in the pack work, I just don't have a feeling they will last for very long.",3,1
"I had a 4th gen iPod, and obviously since it was getting quite old, the battery was lasting a shorter and shorter amount of time.  This replacement kit was a good price, so I bought it.    Pros:  *The battery worked great once I put it in.  *The price is certainly cheaper than having Apple do it for you    Cons:  *The plastic tools they included are cheap and difficult to use.  I had taken apart a few iPods before, so I definitely knew what I was doing, but I ended up bending the gouging the plastic tools since they were softer than the iPod itself.  I know you should use plastic to avoid scratching and damaging the iPod, but these tools kind of sucked.  *Vauge instructions didn't really show you very much.  After looking up instructions on youtube, I had a much better idea of how it was supposed to work.    Summary:  This kit is cheap, so it's definitely worth the money, but you might need to look elsewhere for the instructions and provide your own tools.",3,1
These are super cute and the colors are nice. However they are hard to get on and off.  My kids couldn't do it. I even had trouble.  But they are sturdy and will stay on lol.,3,1
"I was pleased when I received my player. Upside: Compact, easy to use...was able to load songs right away which is the reason I bought it. Lots of other features like photos, voice recorder, FM radio, movies etc.  Downside: Manual doesn't give good enough instructions, sound is a little fuzzy. Now I realise the price has gone up since I bought the first one. Was actually planning to buy another one but it's not worth it at the new price listed.",3,1
"Nice little receiver for the money.  Unfortunately, although it will play digital inputs from USB and SD cards--IT WILL NOT PLAY DIGITAL AUDIO INPUTS FROM DIGITAL TV.",3,1
It's a nice case. The only complaint is that it has to be removed completely to charge the device. Not a very good design feature.,3,1
cool protector...very cool b/c you don't have to carry or worry about a mirror since you have one in your phone.,3,1
"For the price, I thought it was a decent adapter. It was easy to use and plugs right into the cigarette lighter. Finding stations was easy, but in rural areas it was harder to pick up an available frequency. A con about this plug is that for anyone who has a case on their iPhone, you have to remove the bottom portion of the case because the adapter will not fit with it on. The sound quality was adequate.",3,1
"This is the 2nd iTrip I have owned. The first was the same model number and was stolen from my car, this item was purchased as a replacement. Fantastic price, although the seller removed the item from the original package to ship it in a smaller package for less $$. I do not remember if this was clear before purchase. This iTrip does not seem to work as well as my previous iTrip. For example, the cord seems much shorter. Also, frequencies I used all the time on my first iTrip sounded horrible on this iTrip (the same player was used). I found myself trying to re-orient the cord frequently like a pair of rabbit-ear antenna on a TV to try to improve reception with mixed success. I was listening to a podcast similar to a talk-radio broadcast, and the iTrip continued to shut off every 30 seconds or so. The iTrip is designed to do this when not in use, but my first iTrip NEVER did this while listening to a podcast. This iTrip did it constantly while listening to the podcast. WTF???  I was extremely satisfied with my first iTrip, but this one so-far has left me disappointed.",3,2
"For the low cost, the silicone workout case is satisfactory.  The skin fits well, but that is the only plus.  The beltclip broke almost immediately and the armband didn't feel secure.",3,1

"I ordered this case for my birthday and was super excited about getting it in the mail. It came the next day I ordered it which was awesome, but within a week the print started to chip off, leaving white marks. Then about a week after that started to happen, the plastic part of the case started breaking. Finally one of the pieces fell off along with the attaching pieces on the sides of the case. Now I'm scared to use it because of the entire thing falling apart. Over all an OK product.",3,2
I was expecting that it has a stand just like in the picture but it turn  out  to be only a pad that needs a stand but I think it gonna  looks  good on my dash board.,3,1
"This mirror is actually very well made and extremely easy to install (just clip on the orignal rearview mirror, thats it!), it stays on very well and looks great!<br /><br />The GPS works fine, although you do have to download it from the play store ( I use NavFree USA), and the recording is excellent!  1080p quality night and day, very satisfied on that regard.  the power cord is very long so you can actually hide it through the floor mat.  It also has function to Automatically start recording when turning on the Android system.  The 5\\"" Screen is very sharp and color is good.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the software glitches and jumping capacities screen made it unusable for me.<br /><br />First of all, the software:  it does not automatically shut itself off when the car is powered down.  This creates a huge problem, as it will run its own battery out or shut it down automatically, yet when you start up the car again, IT DOES NOT RESTART by itself... defeats the purpose of a vehicle DVR... if you have to remember to turn it on EVERYTIME you start your car, you will most likely forget to turn it on when time goes by, and who wants to do that anyways?<br /><br />Secondly, a smaller concern, is that it does not include a default installation of GPS software.  You'll have to download it yourself, granted, NAVFREE USA is great and works well, less skilled user won't know where to find it.<br /><br />and finally, the capacities screen is jumpy.  about every swipe on the screen, you'll get about 3-4 swipes...  don't know if its just my bad luck that i got a bad unit... or if its the hardware being overly sensitive..<br /><br />Overall, kudo to the creater of this device.  its a great idea to hide GPS and DVR both within the rearview mirror, and made this product with excellent workmanship.  Unfortunately, at this time, its software is just not yet ready for prime time and a jumpy touchscreen.  When they fix both problem, i'll definitely give it another try.",3,1
"As a buyer of well-over 300 Baofeng radios (and counting) for the group I belong to (not all of which were purchased through Amazon but many were), I'm always amazed at the lengths some sellers go to to hype their products as being \\""newer\\"" or \\""better\\"" than other models, or perhaps (to give them the benefit of the doubt) they just don't know any better.<br /><br />First, the Baofeng UV-5R series (including the original and still extremely popular UV-5R, I'll explain why in a minute) is what is normally referred to by many as a SDR radio (or software defined radio).  While not a true SDR product (you can't use it with your computer to control the radio's functions or scan a wide amount of VHF/UHF frequencies with it), none the less a large chip is programmed on the circuit board built inside each radio.  That chip determines what capability the radio itself can perform.<br /><br />Every UV-5R series radio has the ability to transmit from 136-174 MHz on VHF and from 400-520 MHz on UHF in both narrow-band and wide-band modes (very useful for the occasional FRS or MURS use, which requires narrow-band mode to work correctly).<br /><br />Every model does \\""at least\\"" 4W on VHF/UHF from the factory, but occasionally you'll get a batch that does 4.5W or even 5W out, but the difference between 4W and 5W is minimal at best.  A 4W radio with a better antenna will easily outperform a 5W radio with the standard crappy antenna that Baofeng ships on ALL (including the UV-5RA, -5RAX, and -5RAX+) models.<br /><br />Baofeng DOES NOT program those chips any differently for the UV-5R vs. any other UV-5R series (including the UV-5RA).  Version 307 of the firmware (which is the most current release I have in any of my radios) works EXACTLY the same way as previous older releases of firmware at least back to the 295 release (over a year ago), so any claim from a seller that this release provides additional features (at least from a user's perspective) is simply BOGUS, since the firmware inside both radios have the same features.  In fact, my UV-5R radios with the 307 firmware release is EXACTLY the same radio (inside and within the firmware) as my UV-5RA radios with the 307 firmware release.<br /><br />Second, you CANNOT in any way upgrade the firmware (unless you count buying a different radio and it comes with a different firmware release), so again the claim in the listing from some sellers that you can is simply BOGUS.<br /><br />Third, you can believe that two thinner pieces (glued or screwed together on the faceplate of the UV-5RA) is somehow stronger than one thicker piece of plastic (on the original UV-5R series) if you like (and maybe it is), but I haven't seen that in real-world use from my own UV-5RA units.  The standard UV-5R units that we use seem to hold up just as well (when dropped in the desert dirt or rolling down a hill) as any other Baofeng radio we own and use.<br /><br />Fourth, and my biggest issue with all of the non-standard UV-5RA, UV-5RAX and UV-5RAX+ units, is that NONE of the Baofeng battery accessories (except the little 1800 mAh standard battery) work WITHOUT modification (unless you use a Dremel tool to grind or cut off part of your extended battery that works on the standard UV-5R - but won't work on your UV-5RA, UV-5RAX or UV-5RAX+).<br /><br />Getting new UV-5RA units that don't work with Extended 3800 mAh batteries (without modification) doesn't make my group happy.  That may not bother you, but NONE of the sellers of the non-standard UV-5RA, UV-5RAX, and UV-5RAX+ units ever seem to mention that lack of hardware compatibility in their listings, so buyer beware!<br /><br />BTW, NONE of the \\""AA\\"" or \\""AAA\\"" battery shell packs work on the UV-5RA, UV-5RAX, or UV-5RAX+ units either, so that's 3 different battery accessories (including the 3800 mAh extended battery) that you can't use on these radios without hacking them with a Dremel tool (but they all work without modification on the original UV-5R units).<br /><br />So \\""if\\"" you want a \\""pretty\\"" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (or -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.  Oh, you should see how well that shiny faceplate lights up when a flashlight hits it in the dark, just the thing you don't want for night use.<br /><br />Virtually every guy in our group ends up carrying a standard UV-5R and giving the UV-5RA, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ to the wife or kids, since the wife and/or kids rarely care about the other accessories working and they (the wife and kids) tend to like the \\""pretty\\"" radios, but again there is NO INTERNAL difference and NO EXTRA FEATURES in the UV-5RA, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ units (other than a different looking shiny faceplate) vs. the original and still wildly popular UV-5R (which I refer to as the M16 of radios, as all the accessories you match it up with just plain work).<br /><br />Now you know the real background on these radios.f\\"" you want a \\""pretty\\"" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (or -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.

"The Creative Labs Zen Micro Photo 8GB MP3 player was my 2nd MP3 buy. I gave the player 3 stars because I'm comparing it with the Sansa e280 which I absolutely love!!My first was a Sansa (4GB) which was lovely but I wanted more space.    The Zen Micro buy was a \\""mistake\\"" since I wanted a player with video capabilities and I did not realize the Zen Microphoto did not have that function.  The Zen has a \\""boxy\\"", more masculine feel after my sleek Sansa. Not negative, just an obsvervation and preference. Tracks are easily transferred (with Rhapsody-to-go subscription). Photos transfer very easily and quickly as well. The Controls are touch sensitive and can be a bit difficult getting used to. The sound is absolutely wonderful. The picture quality is good. Great price!!    I gave the Zen 3 stars because it does not have video capability and the controls are not that user friendly. I gave the Zen as a gift to a relative who only wanted MUSIC and loves the extra PHOTOS capability and the FM radio. I also purchased the Zen Survival kit which included a wall charger, a car charger, remote control access to the player and speakers (a MUST and at a great price). I have no quarrel with the Zen MicrPhoto player...I have just been \\""spoiled\\"" by ALL of the Sansa e280's (now my 3rd MP3 player) features...it's look, feel and even easier to use controls.",3,1

"Well I did quite a bit of research before I decided to get this wristband. While it looks good and the design idea is good, the silicon cannot securely hold the ipod in place, esp. when you are wearing a jacket! Now it's winter/ spring time and obviously I always wear long sleeves top + a jacket. And every time I take off and put on the jacket, I need to watch out for the ipod cuz it'll either get loose from the wristband or fall out completely! Even you are not trying to take off or put on the jacket, sometimes the sleeve will make the ipod get loose from the wristband to! Besides, after a month or so from using it, I found that it seems to get loose more and more often. :( It's really hard to find a good looking wristband for me as I have relatively small wrists. I like the fit of this wristband, but having to watch out not to break/ lose the ipod from time to time is not fun. I hope the manufacturer can improve their design.",3,1

"I bought this replacement because the traffic receiver had quit working and was out of warranty. (I had had it replaced twice for the same reason during the warranty period). This replacement appeared to be a slightly different model but worked fine as both a charger and a traffic receiver. That is, until one day less than a month after I bought it, when I looked down and didn't see the traffic line on my TomTom GPS at all. A closer look revealed that the light wasn't on, so it wasn't getting power from the car charger. I noticed after I removed the cable from the car charger that the entire tip was missing. I could see the silver ring inside my car's charger, and I had to go to my mechanic to remove whatever was stuck in there that shouldn't be. They found only that ring--the tip must have fallen between the car seats or somewhere--I've never found it.<br /><br />I contacted TomTom support, and they were very nice. I sent them an image of my Amazon order as proof of purchase, and they put in an order for a replacement right away. (I just got it but haven't had a chance to use it yet.)<br /><br />I try to be very careful in how I handle these cables, but they just don't seem to hold up. This is the first one that physically broke off in my car, however.  When they work, they do everything they are supposed to. And TomTom support is great if you buy a TomTom brand. I got this one at a good price, but I just wish it hadn't broken.",3,2

"Old-style locking dock connector.  You may need to trim some cases to fit this cable end, but you won't have to ever remove a case to plug in your iPhone, iPod, or iPad.  Now you can set your device next to any type of dock and use the cable to connect/charge.",3,1

"It's pretty large in size, but it works great! I find myself hesitant to put it in place as I don't want to bump it with my legs or feet while getting in and out of the car or switching pedals while driving. I've used it a couple of times and if you have plenty of space, you will enjoy the reporting it offers. Otherwise, keep in mind, it's about the size of a pack of cigarettes hanging below your dash (on the driver's side), usually.",3,1
"I bought this armband because I wanted to listen to music and track my progress with CardioTrainer while jogging.   The armband itself feels good and fits nicely around the arm. You slip the phone into the pocket of the armband from the top. But the pocket itself is far too big, so that the phone has a lot of space to move and there is no way to close the pocket. When wearing the armband this is not a big issue as the pressure against the arm fixes the phone in the pocket. However, I made the mistake of removing the armband during a break and the phone just slipped out and dropped on the asphalt resulting in a splittered display.  Now I have placed my (repaired) phone inside an Otterbox Commuter case and even with this case it still fits inside this armband - that just as an indicator of how big the pocket is. The combo of case + armband is kind of ideal, so I am happy with the product now, but for the phone alone without a case it is not an ideal fit.",3,1
"I bought this speaker to amplify music I would be playing from my laptop during a party. The sound is loud and clear. However, it is a poor radio.

"I'm not picky and Amazon has been lucky for me, this wasn't more then ten dollars so I am okay that I took the risk. The truth about the product is it is cute looking and even cuter with a little red glow at the bottom when turned on. Now I do not like to give horrible reviews but this product is something the seller should be aware of. First when I got I did not expect it to come with a Micro SD which is what it takes but the box does say it comes with one. Or if I'm reading it right which I though was weird when I opened it. When I saw it it was so cute and was okay it didn't have one i did just wanted it to work. Now I plugged it in it tried to download some sort of soft ware or something which most do and it took a minute to tell me it failed. Okay I didn't put the card in was testing to see if it had some storage space already a little on it just add for more. So I waited and then my computer didn't read it was there. So I put a 4gb card the right kind and tried playing it...nope. the I hooked it up went through read the card through the MP3 player and it recognized it had music. but again would not play. Now if your going to sell a product try understanding it because I don't think they realize they should advertise EASY to use if the music can't play in the first place. So to seller I won't bother getting eight bucks back what I am bothering is giving a happy detailed description of a product that if it was more complicated then what me and a computer genius of a friend I have to see its not a working product for future sake on positive reviews PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE take this product out of your selling items. It is as far as I have tried to my knowledge and others broken. I am very pleased with shipping! So I don't think you understand this certain product is not good, you should try using one yourself. If negative reviews like minus ten was possible I would do it. You need to not sell a non working product, sad I bet you sell other products that do work this isn't one of them. now as perfect as it fit in my little one's hands and fit the speakers I bought her for her B-day I am off to find a working cute mp3 player for her...<br />EDITED: Seller contacted me suggested i charge it 4-6 hours might be better though computer in My computer it won't recognize, however it might if charged? Over all glad the seller cares that is important thank youisn't one of them. now as perfect as it fit in my little one's hands and fit the speakers I bought her for her B-day I am off to find a working cute mp3 player for her...<br />EDITED: Seller contacted me suggested i charge it 4-6 hours might be better though computer in My computer it won't recognize, however it might if charged?

"As others have noted, buttons are small and obscure.  The display is an absolute joke. You almost need a magnifying glass to read it. And, incredibly, there's no dedicated \\""play\\"" button. You have to hold down a combination play/stop button \\""for 2 seconds while the CD player is stopped\\"" according to the directions. Not usable in low-light situations. Not a big deal, but still...who designs these things? A 12-year-old gamer? The battery compartment is inside the unit--you have to open the lid, take out any CD, and then access the battery compartment lid.<br /><br />Unit feels very cheap. No a/c adapter included, which seems really cheap, given the price of this machine. Fortunately I kept the adapter than came with my now-dead Sony D-E307CK. Works just fine.<br /><br />Dual-level mega-bass (High/Low, or off) is still a feature Sony provides, which I like. Some CDs require manipulation one way or another, so it's a great feature.<br /><br />No experience with radio--not interested in that feature.<br /><br />Given the ever-steady total march toward crappy-sounding MP3 audio, portable CD players (and even CDs) are becoming a thing of the past, in spite of the fact that good headphones (SONY MDR-7506 or Shure SRH840 are fabulous) and CDs are infinitely better sounding.  But most folks don't really care because they use MP3s for tune-out ambient sound via ear bud while they multi-task, not to immerse themselves in the music.",3,2
"It didn't work with all of my charging cords for some reason , but i was able to find one for it to work so i guess its a hit or miss with this product, it was strange how i had two identical phone charging cables but only one worked for the charger and both cords are new.",3,2

"This was the first one of these transmitters I've ever bought. I read the reviews and saw all the pros and cons. I thought I would get one and give it a shot from myself. I got it, paid about $10 for it, I had mixed expectations because it was more of an experiment anyway. I got it to work and it did great...the first time. The second time I used it and plugged into the 3.5 mm jack, the port loosened and fell back inside it. I wasn't rough with it either. So that was disappointing. I haven't been able to get it to read my SD card so I probably won't be able to get it to work that way. Luckily, the USB port works fine and I can still use it to listen to music in the car, it's not preferable but hey it works. I probably don't recommend this product, their are probably better one's out there but it'll do until I figure out something better for my car.<br /><br />Update 10/14/12:<br /><br />After several months of trying to make this work (I could only get it to do so by USB) it has finally died on me--it stopped reading the any USB I used. I will now be on the search for a new one.",3,2

"Pro...<br />This is a decent replacement for the OEM radio. Installation took roughly 35 minutes, great display and many audio/video inputs and outputs.<br />iPhone bluetooth calling is great. The GPS navigation is excellent addition to the 2007 FJ Cruiser.<br />GPS has other \\""settings\\"" for over speed limit and warning, (neat feature) and other standard GPS features.<br />Using the settings to remap the steering wheel buttons was simple and without pain nor issue (thankfully).<br />Comes with a remote control for media etc...<br /><br />Cons<br />The iPod/iPhone is supposed to play via bluetooth and it does not even play, even after paring the iPhone, and using the standard AUX input on the console there is no music. But, the music info is displayed on the screen.<br />Some FJ cruisers have an 8 inch subwoofer in the rear, this does not power the subwoofer. There is a difference in the pins and missing some on the provided cable plug. It seems the default pins do not match some optional components in the FJ cruiser.<br />Need to route the GPS cord to some location without drilling holes was a challenge. Finally routed the cable up the side of the center console where the vertical molding snaps and placed on the dash.<br />No locaiton in the FJ for all the audio/video component cables, this must be routed to an open area or somehow reachable to add a device to the connectors. Still trying to figure out how this would work.<br />The USB connector for other media (AVI, DIVX movies stored on a USB drive) has the same issue, where to route and make it availible.<br />As with many touch screens, some DVD menus are hard to navigate and accept the pressing of the screen.<br /><br />My personal rating is 6 / 10. If the iPhone played music would give a 8 /10",3,1

My mom got it before estimated delivery date, she thought it was a great case except when she went to charge her kindle...you have to take the case off to charge the kindle...she said that's the only thing about the case that sucks.

"Advertised as a &#34;leather case,&#34; but the product looks like plastic to me. Works pretty well, but I needed to secure the Nook with a rubber band to keep it from slipping out of the case. This case is excellent at protecting the e-reader, it's working okay in daily use, and holding up well, so it was a worthwhile purchase. May buy a real leather case, if I can find one with an acceptable price, but this one will do for now.",3,1
"CONS:    -Grainy doesn't quite describe the effect this screen protector does to your screen. I bought this screen protector expecting some sort of effect that reduces the clarity of the retina display. However, the actual effect is like when you have drops of water on your screen. You'll see tiny, shiny rainbow specks all over the screen. The specks are very clear on lighter colored background and not at all noticeable on black.    This rainbow effect is definitely NOT the nature of matte screens. All matte screens are supposed to do is make the colors less vibrant, make the blacks gray, and reduce glare.    PROS:    -I gave this screen protector 3 stars because, regardless of the VERY annoying rainbow effect, I just love how the screen protector gives the screen a very smooth touch. Your fingers will slide across the screen much easier but Wet/sweaty fingers will still skip on the screen.    -LESS dust. A simple blow will get rid of all the dust that settles on the screen.    -LESS fingerprints. Fingerprints are much easier to erase and much less visible.    -No glare.    ------------------------    Conclusion:    I use the Kindle app a lot and, with the black background, the rainbow effect only affects the fonts and doesn't really bother me. Some of my favorite games also has a dark background, so the rainbow isn't too bad. The worst things you can do with this screen is probably web-surfing, you'll most likely get a headache if you do that for a long time. In the end, I decided to keep this screen protector until I can find a better one, but I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.    If anyone knows of a good screen protector, please comment. It doesn't really have to be \\""matte\\"" as long as it has a smooth finish.",3,2

"It's fine but really can't handle it when you want to skip more than one track (just buzzes and sounds confused!).

"The elastic band is thick and stretches enough to fit around the headrest in my Civic, but that's the extent of which I am satisfied with this product. I had planned to use this product as a case for my iPad Air 2 all the time, but it doesn't fit right at all. If I decide to keep this case, it will be only for in the car when it needs to be mounted on the headrest.",3,1
"I bought this when I saw others saying it fit or probably fit the 120GB it doesnt its far to big for it, but with some slight modifications adding some paper towels maybe something later on I got it to fit better. Its a lot thinner though, I thought it would be a nice thick case, but my real concern is the back and front. There isnt to much padding on the back and front just the sides.The buttons holes are a little small but I can push in the skin and it'll push it in. Its better then nothing so at the moment cant say its bad, plus its cheap. Im not sure which one its suppose to fit but not bad..not great..but not bad.",3,2
Nice,3,1
Not the best buy.  Sound is not very good and it too low. There is no adjustment for volume increase and it's very hard to pair with other gadgets if it was previously paired to another gadget. We had to do hard reset to do it. Battery also runs out fast.,3,1

"I purchased this product from a local retail store. The quality of the sound was amazing. I could also hear it clearly when I am in a different room.  After a couple of months usage, the wireless connection stop working, the green light does not come up and heard nothing until unplugging and plugging back the power core behind the wireless controller.  It is not a big deal but I have repeat this step every time I use the headphone.",3,2
"But it didn't work for me. I do believe though, that if classroom instruction is what you are dealing with, this will be a fine unit for you. I wanted it to work for me and my cassette tapes and I was not satisfied at all with the overall sound.",3,1
The visual fit and finish is great looks good no problems. The problem comes during the installation when you actually have to mount it. As you can see in the picture there is no mounting the bottom edge. There's not really a mounting for the top either I had to make spacers for that as well. What you don't see is the the bottom of the factory radio has places for the climate control to clip in.  I had to make this work as well. For the price I'm still debating on if I should have just made my own to start with instead of having to finagle this thing in. The only reason I would buy it again would be for the metal radio mounting brackets.,3,1
"I recently got a wave music system as a gift. The iPod connect came free as a promotion offer. I already had a regular iPod dock. The only advantage to this is that it let's you flip through playlists on a touch or iPhone. The playlist feature does not work with my iPod video.<br /><br />The best feature about the connect is that you get one remote for the system v. 2.<br /><br />The value of this dock is really incremental. Since the Bose wave music system alarm cannot wake to aux or iPod, the only reason to get this is because it is free.<br /><br />The Bose wave system itself has good sound for an iPod dock. Only the Bose sound dock 10 or B&w Zeppelin, sounds better, but neither have a built in alarm or radio or CD player. The Bose wave is easily the best overall Alarm clock with an iPod interface. The Polk isonic (which I also own) sounds MUCH better, but is a very very buggy product. So I feel the wave system is worth it. This connector is good if you can get it for free or included with the wave.",3,1

"The FM transmitter works great. All you have to do is find a station that isn't broadcasting anything, and you'll have an iPod radio going in no time. Expect your charger to work for five minutes before breaking though. I'd recommend saving it for a very important moment before using it. And as for the remote, you have to press the button several times before it will finally work. I finally gave up on it, and haven't touched it since.<br />Other than those problems, the FM transmitter does what it's supposed to do. If that's the only reason you're interested in it, then I suggest buying it. If you're looking for a charger and remote, don't do it.",3,1

This was the first cover that I bought for my Kindle. I liked how portable it is. I didnt put a charger in the pocket - found it too bulky. Only problem that I found was that I really wanted something that I didnt slip my kindle in and out of. I thought that I had zipped up the side but didnt - my kindle fell out and hit the floor. This resulted in a replacement because the screen went funny. So I looked for the mounting system one. Still liking this brand. I bought the M-Edge Latitude Jacket. I love this. The only feature that the Touring Sleeve has that the Latitude Jacket doesnt have that I wish it did is the little handle. Both of these covers are made of great materials.,3,1
"I installed this on my motorcycle about six months ago and have experienced reliable service so far.  I'm rating it 3 stars for the following reasons:<br /><br />1.  The kit comes with a mounting bracket that I found useless for my bike, and ugly.  I scrapped it and made my own custom mount.<br />2.  The kit comes with tiny speakers, also somewhat ugly, that I also did not use--I can't rate their sound quality for this reason; I never powered them up.  (My cruiser is much too loud for the small speakers--I purchased a separate set of larger 600w speakers, which I drive with a 400w amplifier.  This radio works well in concert with the other components.)<br />3.  The tuner unit works just fine--it holds presets well; tunes easily; and puts out a clear signal.  However, the clock feature is wildly inaccurate.  In six months, I've learned to ignore it completely--it is now &#34;off&#34; by about 9 hours.<br /><br />All told, it is a good radio unit, with pass-through jacks for mp3 players, etc.  In this way, it does the job just fine.  It is inexpensive, hence the low-grade accessories.  I could rate the radio itself as a &#34;4&#34; if not for the other items in the kit.  So, if you are willing to put in a little extra effort, the unit will provide solid audio reliability at a very low price.",3,1
"I had heard about the Nike + system and thought it sounded really cool, so I went out and got the Sport Band. First off, the thing is still only about 90% accurate (as far as distance) even after you calibrate it. I saw the first time that it was incorrect with the distance, so I wiped the Sport band clean to factory settings and tried to recallibrate it again. Still, messed up. I also think it probably estimates mile times a little on the fast side too. It's good for a solid estimation, but I wouldn't take it 100% seriously. I think it's meant to be a marketing ploy \\""Wow, look how fast/far I am running! I'll buy Nike stuff cause it makes me more athletic!\\"" Blah blah blah. So I guess what I am trying to say is that you can get the Sport band but be prepared to take out a calculator and figure out what 90% of your calories, distance, and time would be since it's that off target. With all that being said, this is probably the best you can get for your money as far as something that charts your run/distance/calories.",3,1

This means the battery meter on the GPS always shows the battery is completely depleted whether it has any charge, and when you charge it there is no indication that charging is completed. I used the newly arrived battery for at least one hour before the GPS unit shut down. I charged the battery overnight, and it again ran for at least an hour before the GPS shut down. Bottom line: the battery is fine if you don't mind not using the battery meter on the GPS.",3,2

Mine is hooked up through USA made Soundstream amps for the front and rear speakers and a Boston Acoustics sub amp pushing an old 12\\"" Orion XTRPro.  I didn't bother to get the Imprint processor although that was part of the reason that I chose the 117 - the sound quality was just that impressive without the add-on.  The sound adjustment possibilities are not for the feint-of-heart.  There are so many variations that the interface can be confusing, but with a little practice it becomes second nature.  I may not be a good baseline for measurement for confusing interfaces as I have had an addiction to digital and analog synthesizers over the years, all of which had navigation issues that would have made a logician blush in frustration...  Anyway, if you can tolerate the sheer volume of possible sound adjustment screens, then running it should be relatively easy as the most accessed controls are typically one or two clicks away from the home screen.  I'm not a fan of the \\""mix\\"" function as it doesn't seem to be as random as what I would consider \\""nearly random\\"" to be.  Users should be aware that random functions in most music devices are \\""near random,\\"" but the mix function leads the music to actually be repetitive with regard to artist or genre.  What this means: if you have grouped things by genre and have multiple songs by the same artist, the 117 tends to continue to gravitate toward playing the same artist for every other selection.  It's really annoying.  USB function works very well.  The 117 reproduces the sound so well that it is easy to distinguish differences in the bit rate of MP3s, even if you aren't an audiophile.  The built in audio restorer does help make MP3s sound better, but it certainly doesn't turn bit-reduced, compressed digital media into LPs.  The radio sounds great and reception is the typical Alpine quality - excellent.  The biggest problem that I have ran into is that the CD skips.  To me, this is nearly inexcusable for an Alpine.  I've had *nothing but* Alpine in-dash cd units or cd changers since 1992, mainly because they would track a CD going over bumps, potholes, railroad tracks, and (if I could have found one) a zombie or two.  This skips while I am listening to a CD with the car off and the volume at \\""7,\\"" sitting in the driveway.  I am completely appalled at this.  It is an unjustifiable engineering error on Alpine's part.  There have been reports around the web about this issue.  For some, CD skipping is no big deal as MP3s or iPod connectivity is their format choice.  For me, CDs were a step backward from LPs in quality - and are about as poor quality as I can tolerate for extended listening roadtrips.  If you are way into quality of sound, the 117 is it as long as you don't mind your CDs skipping every minute and a half.",3,1
I like this product. I rated it at 3 stars for two reasons.   First the actual unit feels cheap. Where the top and bottom plastic meet and the charging cable plug in feels very flemisy and the button to change the station can be real touchy.   Secondly once the iPod is charged I'm finding that the wireless FM can drain the battery in about 3 hours and without the adapter my iPod can run for about 10 hours before charge is low.     All and all worth the money it accomplishes all that I though it would. The seller is the best part very fast shipping I received the unit in 2 days.,3,1
Sound quality is very good but I have not been able to get the remote to work.  The dock has two cords which must be plugged in to the usb port and the headphone jack.  I was hoping for something I could just rest my phone in without having to make these connections.,3,2
"Hard to tell how much this device can do.  I definitely could tell a difference when I installed it, but it didn't *help* in my situation.  I don't blame the device, though.<br /><br />I believe my problem is improper grounding of engine components--sharing the ground with my head unit.  I got to that prognosis by following a troubleshooting flow chart (you can find it by searching &#34;How To Diagnose and Suppress Noise&#34; and looking at crutch field's site).  It's pretty easy to follow, and taught me a lot about taking apart a sound system that I was previously nervous to do.<br /><br />The end result *for me* would be to purchase a crutch field S10-A and install it before the head unit (receiver).  Instead of that, I tried lowering my amp volume and raising the receiver volume and I'm doing fine now.  (engine squeal/noise was being amplified through the amp regardless of receiver volume).<br /><br />Hope that helps!",3,1
It's good they send 2 in the package because the first one was a disaster. The second one applied smoothly but no matter what I did the one corner would not seal to the screen. I trimmed a sliver off of that corner and it improved but the edge still will not seal. I'm sure that it will work fine and in time I will adjust to the slightly grainy look that it gives to the text when I'm reading ... if not ... it will end up in the trash. It hasn't been sunny here since it arrived ... so I have not had the opportunity to see how it works in bright sunlight ... but under a bright light indoors the anti-glare does seem to do an amazing job.<br /><br />Like I always say ... I never expect perfection in anything ... all things are designed and manufactured by humans ... and I have yet to meet a perfect one.<br /><br />... Barb,3,1
"This won't protect from extreme drops, but it will keep the sides and back from getting scratched which is all I really need since I won't be leaving the house with my iPod. I like the looks of it, and I have my screen protector so I'm good.",3,1
broke after two months,3,2
"Works as described although the instructions were very difficult to understand so it took awhile.<br />It does mirror my iPad except for playing an iTunes movie rental it errors out, disappointed for this reason alone but can still stream other media.<br />Had to reboot my router the dongle would not connect to wifi.  Used on iPad will try Andriod another time.",3,1
"A bit flimsy for the cost - probably would have returned it if it was just the case that had been  purchased. First attempt at getting the case on the phone and the kickstand fell off - it's not connected to the case, simply snaps in place.  It is not very sturdy - cough and you will blow your little ipod over when propped up on the kickstand.  The chargers, while functional feel very lightweight and 'cheap'.  Not worth the hassle to return, but if had it to do over,  wouldn't buy this knowing what I know now.",3,2
"I ordered this product for my car which had casseste player. I needed some deive to play music from my cell or frmo USB drive. Got this product from dealer based out of China. Product is good. Best thing is to insert the SD card and play the music from SD card, the quality output id good. Overall I am happy with this product.",3,1
I had the same type of covers and the designs would usually start coming off little by little. But this one didn't as of now and I had it since Christmas.,3,1
"I ordered this product on Feb 1st because my wife received one as a gift and I liked the ways it worked.  Mine will not work on hands free when making a call. I have to push the green light button to make a call and the red button to end a call.  If the name of the person you are calling is in your phone as a contact, you should be able to say &#34;call - the name of the person you want to  call.  About 50% of oral calls go to a different number than the one you wanted.  This can be embarrassing.  My wife's unit has now started having the same problems.<br /><br />Also, on 2-25-13 I emailed their service dept for help on these issues and as of yet to hear back from them.",3,1
The unit that holds the camera doesn't hold / fit (too small) the Galaxy Note 3.  The Matek service department was courteous and promptly refunded the purchase price. The overall quality of the products was satisfactory.,3,1
"moisture seems to get in, had to seal it with clear silicone ,however it does the job",3,1
Slacker wouldn't support this radio,3,2
"The sound quality is pretty good, but not as good as an auxiliary connection of course.  If your car does not have any way to install an aux connection, like mine, this product is great.  My only complaint is that my car charger input is horizontal, and the weight of this device sometimes pulls the connection apart when I hit any kind of bump, this resets the station to 88.1FM, so I got in the habit of leaving my radio tuned to 88.1FM even when there is interference.  Also this disconnection causes the song to restart.  I started resting the device on my shifter, (I have an automatic trans so its not too much of a problem) and this somewhat solved the issue. Also my remote never worked even if I change the battery, not that I ever would use it though.",3,2
The plug end of to power supply is not the same as the production unit. It's aligned sideways so its harder to plug in to outside plugs.,3,2
Nothing spectacular. We are happy. It does it's job and protects the case. Recommend buy if all you want is a protector for the outside of your case,3,1
I bought this and it came without a power cord. Amazon offered to credit me 10 dollars and then the seller contacted me. They said that they would send me a power cord. So it all worked out well it just took some time. It is a good powerful product I would have preferred a power cord being included.,3,1
It is good protection on your screen but it does cut down on the clairty of the screen. It is OK,3,1
"Well, I'm sure that the product works very well on an I-phone 4...however, I have an I-phone 3!  I guess I misunderstoon when it said the charger was for an Iphone 4/3g/s Ipod...I thought it would fit the Iphone 3 & 4...Sorry!",3,1
"Inexpensive replacement for the USB cable that also dose triple duty as a wall charger and auto charger. Not the best quality, but it does the trick.",3,1
"Ive used Tsunami for my past car stereos and not had any issues. This kit however, not sure I would purchase again.. like others have said, the power and ground cables were coated with a sticky oil substance that made them stick to everything and made running them a pain- it also gets all over your hands, etc. The copper inside the cables was all oxidized which is never a good sign.. the kit does not come with RCA cables so you will need to purchase those separately.. the 100a fuse at the battery is a very poor design, which makes installing it a lot more work than it should be.. the pros are that the kit is cheap, comes with a distribution block and shipping was pretty fast..",3,1
"Hi,  Personally, I expected a lot more. I don't like the design that much as other buyers suggested, so I am a little disappointed with the product. I have not dropped my iPod yet, so I cannot talk about shock absorbency. However, the material seems protective. I loved the Griffin Outfit Mist case, so I may just buy that one...",3,1
"It looked like a good case, but I thought the Kickstand was a bit flimsy for a 10 year old.  He chose another case.",3,1
"Shipping took a long time !  Really like this mini-cam, very small, inconspicuous, nobody notices it. It has performed well for the 30 days I've had it. . Simple, easy to scroll through menu. Will probably buy another one for other vehicle.",3,1
"Ipod only works while AC powered, not sure if battery was good, can't play mobile uncharged! Was delivered promptly but still has same issue!!!!!!!!",3,1
It worked really well at first but later the tape deck would not play it and kept changing sides. I tried loosening the screws like I did with my other Adapsonic that was just the adaptor without the mic and it still did it. Just stopped using it after a while. It still worked when last I used it but was unreliable. Discarded it for a bluetooth to FM adapter.,3,2
"First off got the package and it came with the wrong cable, no biggie I emailed costumer service and the told me to keep the cable that came and they would send the right cable (they also noted that the correct zune cable was on back order, I recieved it about a week after they said they would have it).  The cable finally came in and it isnt quite as thick and heavy duty as the OG zune cable but it does work, just a knock off.  The arm band is pretty bulky for what im used to with past mp3 players but the zune does fit into this UNIVERSIAL army band quite snuggly.  All in all I couldnt complain about the product overall after getting everything.",3,1
"Got this for my daughter in January 2011 to protect her new Itouch.  It is a beautiful case, but just won't stay together right.  Ordering a leather case now.",3,1
"There were no instructions in the packet, everything was just thrown in, so I had to guess what to do with the items.  The wireless transmitter doesn't work at all, as other people have mentioned. I am not sure why I would want so many soft Nano covers, and I still can't work out how to get the  clear plastic screen preservers to stay on the Nano. The speakers do work, not top grade, but adequate, and the earbuds are actually quite a nice tone, but a bit uncomfortable to wear in the ear. Hope this is useful!",3,2
"Although functional, the set feels cheap. The tension wrenches are not worth keeping but the picks are not too bad. The shipping times were very long",3,2
Sounded great in the car and I was able to move it from car to car but the area around the small adjustment screw broke so it won't stay upright any more.,3,1
"The Splash screen protector for the kindle succeeds in ease of application and protection from scratches but ultimately fails because it does not provide for anti-glare reading.     The tab system it uses for installation is simple and easy. I had little trouble with bubbles and the bubbles that did appear were easy to smooth out. The protector leaves a very slight gab between screen and device allowing for mostly optimal coverage. It also does protect against scratches well.    however    The glare is enormous. Reading indoors near any light source is a problem, so you can imagine what it would be like outdoors on a sunny day. It completely defeats the reason the kindle is so popular. Why take a device that works in light and then add a screen protector that causes glare. Really there is no point.     I would recommend this product if you are only looking for protection and ease of use. I would not recommend this product if you are concerned about glare.",3,1
"I received the ipod case product in a very timely manner, but the case was cracked a little on the bottom, not real noticeable , but it would not close and snap shut completely.",3,2
in the forums people have trouble with the '96 because cadillac wired it stupid so the factory stereo got 17V.  you can use this adapter but you'll have to run a new ACC wire.  I used the pink wire powering the passenger side window and ran it behind the glovebox.  this way it still has the retained power,3,1
"The company selling did awesome - I received it way in advance of expected delivery date..., only problem is - it's not very loud.  I really hoped for more volume from it, and it does fall short there.  But for the price I really can't complain too much.  If I wanted better I could have spent more.  You get what you pay for.  But as far as the online experience it was way above average.",3,1
sound is ok nothing too crazy as i expected but the button is messed up. it gets off track it seems and i cannot turn the darn thing off. when i slide it it stays on untill i figet with it for 5 minutes and then finally cut it off. my return window is up(go figure).,3,2
The tape gets ejected in some tape decks. And the pads aren't in very securely (one is almost completely out of its place). I'm not sure how effective it is at cleaning.,3,1
"This case is perfect for the price paid (<$3 including shipping).  The only problem is elastic straps that keep it from opening completely (and keep GPS from falling out) interfere with zipper closing.  In addition to Garmin GPSs listed, this also fits other 4.3\\"" units such as nuvi 2350.",3,1
"It works, and its pretty easy to use. Battery life is ok about 8 hours from my experience. But given how I've only really used it for about a hour a day it easily lasts a week for me without having to recharge. A small note to remember is that if you charge this via USB on a computer then you'll have to manually close it again after detaching it as it'll turn on.<br /><br />I gave this a 3 star rating because this is really just a bare minimum product, it will work, it won't disappoint you, but it definitely has its flaws.",3,1
"I wouldn't recommend this case for maximum protection if ipod is dropped. However, I love the grip and feel of the soft silicone!",3,1
"Gave it 3 stars because the case fit my 4th gen nano well, and it will provide the required protection. I would have given it 4 stars if the belt clip would actually hold the case to my belt (it won't hold because it doesn't have enough spring tension). To gain 5 stars the clip would have had to hold AND the case would not have been delivered with an abrasion in an area over the pod's screen. The abrasion doesn't affect readability and likely would have resulted eventually with normal use anyway. But the case was supposed to be new, and hence should not have been delivered with any signs of use or wear.",3,2
"I purchased this charger because the listing claimed it was a genuine HTC charger. The description stated that it had a coiled cord...it does not. And, at least one review talked about it having the HTC logo on it and that it lit up. Neither is true. As well, the fit in my phone is not tight. It does charge the phone, but nothing lights up on it so I never really know if it is charging and/or if the charge is complete. I purchased the charge because of the claims of the coiled cord and the charging light, etc. None of that is so.",3,2
"Really a great product, clip holds your device securely on your belt and allows easy detach/reattach with the push of a button. However the clip broke after a month or two so now it's not really usable since I need it on my person at all times... It would be great if they sold replacement clips...  UPDATE 10/30/2010:  Have updated my rating from 3 to 4 stars, because I contacted the seller (via amazon) about the broken clip and was extremely happy with their solution (they sent me a free replacement clip). Hooray!  UPDATE 12/4/2010:  Replacement clip broke today. :-( I was only squeezing it normally to remove it from my belt, and *snap*!   Since I actually need this thing to live on my belt, I will need to look for another solution. It's unfortunate, because the case is sturdy, high-quality, and really well-made; it's just the clips that are crap. Alas!  UPDATE 4/9/2011:  Yet another replacement clip broke today. It lasted a lot longer because I NEVER unclipped it from the belt once I had clipped it on (this is what I recommend to new purchasers). But one day, the edge of my iTouch caught on something and bam, another clip bites the dust. Sayonara.",3,1
"I purchased this item because it states that &#34;Supports Analog Audio Out&#34;. It does not. This was a concern from the start as I know that for the iPhone 5 to support Analog Audio Out through the lightning connector, the adapter needs to have a DAC (Digital to Analog Converter) to produce the audio, since the lightning connector is digital-only.<br />Still, four adaptors for this price, is not a bad deal.",3,2
Doesn't have many of the functions advertized,3,1
"These products are just \\""ok\\"". Nothing awesome. The leather cAse in my opinion smells bad, and I have no use for a couple of the items it came with. I actually bought a case for my nano 5g at wal mart and prefer that one..",3,2

"[[VIDEOID:2451b84e0011e5ad274192827078bb1]]When this dash cam works and the video file is saved successfully and can be displayed the quality of the video is quite good.  However I ran into a number of technical issues which detract from what could have been a nice dash cam.<br /><br />The first unit I received could not advance past the \\""welcome\\"" page.  The return and replacement was easy as anything on Amazon.<br />The second unit records without problems, however many of the files on the micro sd are not viewable. The error reads \\""The format of xxx.mov cannot be detected.\\""  This is a serious problem because unlike many cameras that save small files often this camera saves large files, so if something goes wrong when it saves the entire recording sessions is lost.<br /><br />By trial and error I determined the video files are not saved correctly related to how the dash cam is stopped.  It appears that if I disconnect USB power and let it run for a few minutes on internal battery until it runs out of juice it saves the file the file is saved fine and they can be played back.  However if I stop recording by just turning off ignition in the car (which is what I have always done with the other dash cams) the file is not saved properly and is corrupted. I also was not able to read the file when I used on/off button to turn off the unit itself prior to turning off ignition.<br /><br />On the positive side:<br /><br />✔ Video quality of the dash cam is quite good as you can see in attached video.<br />✔ This camera has an excellent suction cup mount, stayed on even on rough roads.<br />✔ The dash cam uses standard micro USB cables.<br />✔ The cam has an LED display so I can tell that the cam is aimed correctly.  The display flashes a bit as you drive, I have not seen this with the older dash cams we own.<br />✔ Recording starts as soon as it gets power so you don't have to remember to turn it on.<br /><br />The AmorTek package includes the camera, two mini USB cables, and cigarette lighter USB adapter.<br /><br />The user interface is straightforward and even though the manual does not contain details for each button and each option, it contains a picture where each button's function is labelled. I found the manual sufficient to configure my video cam. All defaults are reasonable.<br /><br />Overall, this dash cam has good potential but appears to be an early version which still has some technical issues to iron out especially with reliable saving of files.<br /><br />This video cam is provided by AmorTek.

"The color finish of the case was not as shiny as in the picture; it was dulled and had more of a flat finish, which is not apparent from the picture.

"It doesn't reduce noise at all.  It's no better than the earphones I buy at Radio Shack on sale.  On the plus side, it's extremely comfortable in my ears and the cords is flat so it doesn't tangle much.",3,2
"Super quick delivery on this item so no complaints there.  The item is not quite as the images show.  The little 'flap' that allows the tablet to stand up is not present on the model I received.  You have to turn the cover back on itself to form a triangle that supports the tablet in an upright position.  The cover IS made to allow for this but I am a little wary that at some stage the cover will crack.  No big issue for the price paid though.  The keyboard takes a little getting used to after using a full sized one but the keys are nicely spaced and you do get fully used to it after a short time.<br />If I have an issue with the quality of the case with regards to the folding of the cover I will update my review.  If you don't see an update then assume that all is well.<br />All in all, good value.  Works well and connects via Bluetooth easily.  Charge lasts for quite some time.<br /><br />UPDATE JULY 29th 2014;<br /><br />The unit has been working ok but I am now having issues and am in communication with the seller.  They are responding promptly and I hope for a successful solution soon.<br /><br />One thing that I do not like is that the unit I received was NOT as pictured.  The little flap that is seen holding up the tablet side of the case would work better than the system on my case.  This unit slips and does not hold the tablet up as well as expected.  Rating altered to reflect current issues.  I will update further as things proceed.<br /><br />UPDATE August 1st 2014:<br /><br />I have had very prompt and helpful service from the seller and I will make it quite clear that I have absolutely no issue at all with them.  Communication between us has been good and they were helpful in trying to solve my product issues.  However, the product is only working randomly,more not than it does.  The seller has FULLY refunded ALL costs but has made no mention of returning the product.<br />I take this opportunity to thank the seller for their great service.

"I'm a longstanding fan of Cambridge SoundWorks products.  Regrettably, my Oontz experience has been compromised on a few fronts.<br /><br />First, Cambridge shipped my Oontz via UPS with over-21 signature required.  It's not a brick of gold strapped to champagne; it's an inexpensive Bluetooth speaker.  While I understand that such a requirement protects Cambridge, it's a pain for the recipient.<br /><br />Second, Cambridge doesn't include a 120v power brick; instead, it provides for USB charging.<br /><br />Third, I was hoping the obnoxious Oontz! graphic on the top of the speaker would be a removable sticker.  It isn't.<br /><br />That being said, it is a fairly powerful little speaker (albeit with predictably lackluster bass reproduction), and - like all Cambridge products - initially seems well-built.  Amazon doesn't want competing products identified in reviews, but - as the owner of a competitive product - the old adage that you get what you pay for holds true.  And you don't pay much for an Oontz.",3,2

The picture shows two stylus and it only came with one that didn't work. That was my main reason for choosing that one.,3,2
I bought this for work since I would be using a different vehicle everyday. I work in construction wouldn't know if the radio in it would have a tape deck to use my tape adapter... but anyway.<br /><br />Pros:<br />very convenient use an SD card or thumb drive full of music - so much easier than having to plug in an external music player<br />Very easy to set up<br /><br />Cons<br />The volume of the music seemed very quiet. I would have the volume up all the way on the unit but would still have to drastically turn up the radio volume.<br />The random feature seems to get stuck on the same songs. I had 400 songs on the card but while on random it would repeat a song after only playing 4 or 5 other songs.<br />The display is too small to read easily while driving.<br /><br />Overall I am generally satisfied with the product but I did purchase it with minimal expectations.,3,1

I wondered why....More on that later.<br /><br />This is what the description says:(Important Delivery Parts are manufactured in USA, Japan and Germany, not in China!)<br />When I received the package, it was only then that I realized it was made in China.<br /><br />So, as you can see, the description is very misleading. If I had known that it was made in China, I would not have bought it. As you can see, even the seller of this inverter has no confidence in products made in China, yet they are still selling them using misleading information in their description and even the grammar and english are bad...I should have noticed that before I purchased but I was so desperate to get off the grid that I took it for granted.<br /><br />I haven't used the inerter yet so I don't know its capabilities but when I get it installed and test it then I will post a review of its capabilities. For now I am using a 500w UPS for a computer which is great for powering all my lights and a Blender. All I did was to swap the small internal 12volt battery to two 12volt 70 amp car batteries and changed the connecting cables with longer,thicker cables. This gives me power all night then I charge them the next day as I haven't installed my wind power generator yet.",3,2
"I needed a replacement for my Garmin 670, it does charge the system but does not allow it to remain on while doing so (you cannot access directions while it is charging) For what I needed I should have bought directly from Garmin.",3,1
"I like this, but am a little disappointed in the charging port.  It says that it will fit your phone with the case on, and unfortunately, that is not the case for both mine and my husband's Iphone 6 phones (and we both have different cases).  It does flex, so will fit even your big thick cases.  If you have a case where it doesn't come up to completely cover the edges of the phone and also if the case doesn't have separate openings for the charging port and also the headphone port, then you will probably be okay.  We have to slide the bottom part of our phone out of the case in order to dock it.  The buzzer sound on it isn't very loud, but you can go to Itunes and download alarm buzzer songs that you can program the alarm to use instead.  I think that softer buzzer sound that is the default tends to be the norm now.  He has the default buzzer set to be his backup alarm, which seems to be working well.  Since the charging port doesn't fit well on our phones and taking off our cases each time is a hassle, we are mainly using it as a radio and using our phones as our alarm clock.  The speakers put off great sound and the setup is extremely easy.  It is as simple as docking your device and adding the app that pops up after docking it.  The clocks will sync, etc. and you should be good to go.  Because of the charging problems with the docking station, I think it is a little pricey.  We had hoped to use it as an alarm clock, and charge our phones at the same time, but that isn't working out - so we are a little disappointed.",3,1
"As a buyer of well-over 300 Baofeng radios (and counting) for the group I belong to (not all of which were purchased through Amazon but many were), I'm always amazed at the lengths some sellers go to to hype their products as being \\""newer\\"" or \\""better\\"" than other models, or perhaps (to give them the benefit of the doubt) they just don't know any better.<br /><br />First, the Baofeng UV-5R series (including the original and still extremely popular UV-5R, I'll explain why in a minute) is what is normally referred to by many as a SDR radio (or software defined radio).  While not a true SDR product (you can't use it with your computer to control the radio's functions or scan a wide amount of VHF/UHF frequencies with it), none the less a large chip is programmed on the circuit board built inside each radio.  That chip determines what capability the radio itself can perform.<br /><br />Every UV-5R series radio has the ability to transmit from 136-174 MHz on VHF and from 400-520 MHz on UHF in both narrow-band and wide-band modes (very useful for the occasional FRS or MURS use, which requires narrow-band mode to work correctly).<br /><br />Every model does \\""at least\\"" 4W on VHF/UHF from the factory, but occasionally you'll get a batch that does 4.5W or even 5W out, but the difference between 4W and 5W is minimal at best.  A 4W radio with a better antenna will easily outperform a 5W radio with the standard crappy antenna that Baofeng ships on ALL (including the UV-5RA, -5RAX, and -5RAX+) models.<br /><br />Baofeng DOES NOT program those chips any differently for the UV-5R vs. any other UV-5R series (including the UV-5RA).  Version 307 of the firmware (which is the most current release I have in any of my radios) works EXACTLY the same way as previous older releases of firmware at least back to the 295 release (over a year ago), so any claim from a seller that this release provides additional features (at least from a user's perspective) is simply BOGUS, since the firmware inside both radios have the same features.  In fact, my UV-5R radios with the 307 firmware release is EXACTLY the same radio (inside and within the firmware) as my UV-5RA radios with the 307 firmware release.<br /><br />Second, you CANNOT in any way upgrade the firmware (unless you count buying a different radio and it comes with a different firmware release), so again the claim in the listing from some sellers that you can is simply BOGUS.<br /><br />Third, you can believe that two thinner pieces (glued or screwed together on the faceplate of the UV-5RA) is somehow stronger than one thicker piece of plastic (on the original UV-5R series) if you like (and maybe it is), but I haven't seen that in real-world use from my own UV-5RA units.  The standard UV-5R units that we use seem to hold up just as well (when dropped in the desert dirt or rolling down a hill) as any other Baofeng radio we own and use.<br /><br />Fourth, and my biggest issue with all of the non-standard UV-5RA, UV-5RAX and UV-5RAX+ units, is that NONE of the Baofeng battery accessories (except the little 1800 mAh standard battery) work WITHOUT modification (unless you use a Dremel tool to grind or cut off part of your extended battery that works on the standard UV-5R - but won't work on your UV-5RA, UV-5RAX or UV-5RAX+).<br /><br />Getting new UV-5RA units that don't work with Extended 3800 mAh batteries (without modification) doesn't make my group happy.  That may not bother you, but NONE of the sellers of the non-standard UV-5RA, UV-5RAX, and UV-5RAX+ units ever seem to mention that lack of hardware compatibility in their listings, so buyer beware!<br /><br />BTW, NONE of the \\""AA\\"" or \\""AAA\\"" battery shell packs work on the UV-5RA, UV-5RAX, or UV-5RAX+ units either, so that's 3 different battery accessories (including the 3800 mAh extended battery) that you can't use on these radios without hacking them with a Dremel tool (but they all work without modification on the original UV-5R units).<br /><br />So \\""if\\"" you want a \\""pretty\\"" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (or -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.  Oh, you should see how well that shiny faceplate lights up when a flashlight hits it in the dark, just the thing you don't want for night use.<br /><br />Virtually every guy in our group ends up carrying a standard UV-5R and giving the UV-5RA, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ to the wife or kids, since the wife and/or kids rarely care about the other accessories working and they (the wife and kids) tend to like the \\""pretty\\"" radios, but again there is NO INTERNAL difference and NO EXTRA FEATURES in the UV-5RA, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ units (other than a different looking shiny faceplate) vs. the original and still wildly popular UV-5R (which I refer to as the M16 of radios, as all the accessories you match it up with just plain work).<br /><br />Now you know the real background on these radios.f\\"" you want a \\""pretty\\"" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (or -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.

"expected more but really just another pair of inexpensive ear phones.  The noise reduction does not work at all and the clarity of the music coming through is not clear.  I had another pair of noise reduction ear phones and cannot remember the brand but they were amazing, these are not.",3,1

"It works,  you have to be a little tech savvy but you get what you paid for.  I finally broke down and bought a GoPro.  I needed a little more reliability and a more durable product.  This one I gave to the kids and they are enjoying it.",3,1
It arrived As expected not the part didn't really fit the original slot I didn't end up using it. Great service nevertheless,3,2
Looks exactly like the photo. Just not sure how long it will last but it would probably break pretty easy if got caught so for safety it's good. It was for my 6 year old who received an iPod for his birthday.,3,1
"I love the color, but the sound quality is not that great.<br />Love the fact that its blue tooth compatible",3,1
"Bought this device to monitor my efforts during jogging.<br />The good news: the GPX-tracks are quite accurate and show little distortions (better than my previous GPS-tracker). So the device does what it should. The battery also has some stamina and you can thus use this device also for day long hiking tours. Recharging can be done via USB. There is a silicon cover to prevent damage and water ingress, and a holder to attach it to your bicycle, but you can not use both of these at the same time (strange).<br />The software is the wak part: The user interface is irritating even after some time of use. You always have to concentrate and check if you have selected the correct function. The display is readable, but the information shown is difficult to read due to the font used.<br />The GPX-tracks have some time stamp format issues, so I have to edit them before importing them into my database (QLandkarteGT). The files size is also blown up because each single tag contains a link to the web site of the SW-shop that created the code. One link it the header would have been sufficient.<br />The PC-software provided is also minimalistic. I was unable to to use the Google-Map function to show my tracks on a map (might be due to the fact that I ran this Windows SW under Linux using Wine). You can copy GPX-tracks between the device and your computer, but it does not allow you to delete any files on the device. For this you have to use the buttons on the device and navigate through several screens. Online support by K&R is limited to providing the PDF-version of the manual and year old SW.<br />So overall the Easy Traxx does more or the less what is was expected to do, but in a way that is not really exiting.",3,1
bought this for a friend as a gift and he totally loves it.      Rick,3,1
"I like the look of this case, but I don't like the fact that I can't get it off. The directions aren't helpful at all. I would recommend buying something that is just as easy to get on as it is to get it off.   Not happy in the least.",3,2
"For its class this unit is hands down the best option available.  Unlike most others, it works...as long as you have a blank frequency open.  If I was just rating this unit against its peers I would give it 5 stars.  It works well in my car, the only one of five different brands I've tried.  The 3 stars is for the flaw in this technology to begin with.  It simply isn't viable or practical.  The remote is a huge help and a nice touch.  All in all, if you must own a FM transmitter for your iPod, get this one.",3,1
"I purchased this [locally] for use in my Subaru Outback.  On the first day I tried it in my car which has an aux input, just to see how it worked.  There was a notable amount of static on any station unless I stretched the audio cable (which I presume to work as an antennae) out completely, and hung the MP3 player on my sun visor.  That car has a small antennae on the center of the roof at the rear.     In my Subaru Outback, which has an in-glass antennae in the rear window, it was much easier to find a good placement, which gave surprisingly good sound quality.  On a long trip I would find a clear station (easily done by pressing one of the scan buttons, then tuning the radio to that station) and then listen on that station for a few hours until I started hearing some interference, then press scan and I'd be good to go again in a few seconds.  It supported the entire FM band, though I mostly tested in the higher frequencies, since they tend to have more bandwidth (ever notice how music stations tend to be near the top of the dial, and community and talk stations near the bottom of the dial? That's why.)    Dynamic range was as good as can be expected for FM transmission, the signal was clear, strong, and consistent, there was good stereo separation.  The only abnormality that I detected was a slight hissing/crackling in the \\""s\\"" sounds of certain lyrics... Overall I was pleased -- cheaper than a new stereo with a true aux input!    That said... it's going back to the store today.  The reason is because I frequently listen to classical music.  Apparently whoever designed this never actually tried it with classical music as during quiet passages it would fail to detect that there was actually music playing and would turn itself off... since it was a quiet passage the stereo was always turned up to overcome road noise, and I'd nearly go through the roof due to the sudden surge of loud static.  After five or six of these experiences I stopped using it for classical music and determined that I would be returning it.  Too bad, it's otherwise a very nice device.  If they'd get rid of, or allow disabling of, the power save feature (why it's needed is unclear, since it plugs into the cigarette lighter) it'd be perfect.  If you only plan to use it for pop/blues/otherwise 'noisy' music I'd definitely recommend it.  If you like classical or listen to a lot of audiobooks or podcasts you might want to look elsewhere.  Also expect that your car's antennae configuration may also have some bearing on the sound quality.",3,1

"This product worked, but failed rather quickly.  The digitizer is extremely fragile, and quite easy to destroy.  The assembly does not come with a new glue strip to attach it to the iPod.  I was aware of this, and purchased some double-sided tape that others had purchased with this item here on Amazon.  This didn't really work very well, and the screen constantly came loose.  Eventually, the digitizer stopped working again, and the assembly is now trash.  I found a seller in HK that provides the proper attachment strip, but they do not sell here unfortunately.  It's small details that make a BIG difference between an OK repair part, and a great repair part.  This part is OK, but not that great.  It lasted all of two days for me.",3,2

"This unit paired easily, has simple controls, and overall has good sound quality. I also purchased a Photive CYREN, which costs more but has a much fuller sound to my ear. This unit sounds a bit thin at the bottom end, where the CYREN is punchier. The CYREN also is heftier, it's flat bottom tends to sonically couple it to whatever it is resting on, and it looks like it would handle the inevitable drop to the floor better. Like everything else you get what you pay for. This is not a bad option for the money, but if you can spend a few more bucks look elsewhere.",3,2
"For the price and GB size of this MP3, it is OK.  I'm not able to group certain songs into Playlists though.  So each song has to be played separately or one after another by title, or randomly.  Even though I downloaded music files that were picked Playlist by Playlist.  And like others have said, the writing and games are in Chinese and can't be altered.  But it comes from China and I was aware of it, so I was prepared.  The on/off button is fickle, to say the least.  I almost sent it back because it didn't turn on at first.  It seems to be hit and miss.  But with cheaper prices these days, this often happens.  I'm happy to be able to afford this over other more expensive options that cost hundreds of dollars.",3,1

"No way does this thing deserve 5 stars. It's a $100 camera. Far better than the $30 cheap-o camera I came from. I don't need the best camera in the world, but I do want something that takes good video. This camera takes pretty good video, though sadly my old $30 piece-o-junk took better video at night. The main problem with this camera is that every street light and car brake light creates a massive light-blur sphere. In some cases, so big that brake lights will cover the license plate of the car in front of you. It's not the best at night, but aside from the light issues, it takes pretty good video.  The biggest problem with this thing, is that it's base is designed for a right-hand drive car. What I did is took out the two little screws on the connector that connects the camera to the base. I then turned the connector on the camera 180 degrees, trimmed off some unnecessary plastic underneath to make it fit right, and now the base faces the same direction as the camera. I'm not really sure whose bright idea it was to put so much strain on the camera and base. Now the whole assembly is much more compact, the power plug on the base faces towards the rear-view mirror, which is where power comes from. I tried so many other ways to mount it, but the mount is very poorly thought out. You can't flip the mount around in its stock form and twist to adjust the camera. The camera won't twist that far. The camera really needs to be able to twist 270 degrees at a minimum, but the best you get is 100 degrees or so. It's just hard to get right. I have mine mounted about 8&#34; to the left of the rear-view mirror at the very top of the windshield. It catches everything. I like that this has all the capabilities of GPS and video, but it's still pretty cheap. I guess we'll see how it does in the summer. For now, it's cold here in Colorado. Overall, the mount sucks. Having to stick it to the windshield is stupid, but it is nice and compact. I do like that I don't ever have to unplugit. I think eventually I will epoxy the base to a proper suction cup mount.  The audio is fine. Better than my old camera. I can hear my daughter from the back seat if the stereo isn't up.  The blue LED light is extremely annoying at night. Too bright. Had to cover it with a piece of electrical tape.  It takes a good 30 seconds to get a GPS fix, first thing in the morning.  The interface is cheap. Pretty much identical to my old camera.  I'm sure it's going to lock up one day, and there is no reset button. Even my old one has a reset button.  It's exactly what I want out of a $100 camera. I'm not trying to make feature film in my car.  UPDATE 3/16/2015: I've been using this thing for 3 months now, and while I have yet to catch any accidents or injuries, I have caught many police breaking the law, which have resulted in citations being issued. I also got a recording of a police officer misinforming me of a reckless driving law on private property, which resulted in a formal complaint being filed against that officer. Audio is crystal clear, and the video is great. I'm happy with this camera, but we'll see how it goes when it starts to get hotter outside, since there are so many complaints about issues with heat.",3,1
"The color is great on this unit.  The only drawback is that the case is loose and allows my iPad to move around a little more than I would like.  Overall, it protects nicely and serves it purpose, I wanted a cover and something for protection.",3,1

"***ORIGINAL REVIEW***<br /><br />Received this as a gift.  Have heard great things about iHome products (sister has had one for years...works great.)  I got about 10 hours worth of playback on this unit.  Then, suddenly, it just STOPPED WORKING.  No lights, no sound - stylish paperweight.  Troubleshooting steps are a frickin' joke.  As the other reviewer mentioned...you can send to manufacturer for repair/replace along with \\""handling costs\\"" which have DOUBLED since his review.  $60 with proof of purchase, $100 without proof of purchase.  May as well just buy another one...one not manufactured by this company.  That's not a warranty, that's a scam.  I will avoid iHome AT ALL COSTS in the future.  Sorry guys, your product sucks and your \\""warranty\\"" sucks even more.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br /><br />I wanted to leave the original review to capture the whole experience.  Since this was written, I sent iHome a less than complementary letter about my experience.  They asked me to send the unit to them...cost me like $6 to ship to NJ.  They received on a Friday afternoon and attempted to delivery a replacement unit the following Monday.  (super fast...nice work on that end.)  Signature service was required, so it cost me another $5 to have it rerouted to my office.  So, for $11 I got the unit replaced.  A far cry from the $60 they required in their warranty info.  In the end, they did a nice job redeeming themselves.  I still think they need to edit their warranty write up...very misleading (or I was a squeaky-wheel-gets-the-grease-case.)  Anyhow, the speaker sounds great...hope I get more than 10 hours out of this one!  If it lasts, they won me back as a customer.  I'm hesitant to go higher than 3 stars as I just plugged the thing in last night.  Assuming it lasts, I'll adjust.",3,1

"This player is very nice, but it seems poorly engineered. What I mean is that it has 1000 features, like ever changing lcd colors, voice recording, dancing icons, etc but the real reason i bought it, the mp3 playing, doesn't work well enough.<br /><br />The fast forward on the mp3 is so slow it's basically not worth doing, if the time on the mp3 goes above an hour (like from a radio show, book, etc) you can't see the time anymore...plus it gets confused about picking up where it left off.

Once you have some frequencies picked out, mark the antenna shaft with a permanent marker so you can re-tune quickly.<br /><br />The bandwidth on 80 meters is extremely narrow (the only band I tested so far), with SWR rising sharply on either side of the resonant frequency.<br /><br />I think this antenna would work well for portable use on a narrow band digital mode like PSK31 where you aren't tuning all around the band hunting for contacts. If you already know what frequency you'll be using and don't plan to change often, then it's  a reasonable compromise vs. the cost of a well made screwdriver antenna or an antenna tuner.<br /><br />Even with a tuner I suspect you could quickly exceed the maximum mismatch the tuner can handle as you tune away from the resonant frequency.<br /><br />I tested mine mounted to a chain link fence which acted as a makeshift counterpoise. The SWR dipped to about 1.3:1 on the 80 meters band. I haven't tried it mobile, but I have a jeep and they are notoriously problematic for mobile installations anyway.",3,1
"It did not work with any of my Nook products and is certainly not of very good quality. The worst part was the phone call, and emails asking me to rerate the product, though they did offer to have me return it, it was not worth my time to do so.",3,2
"Unfortunately there are not many in stock for the Skyrocket, so we have this option and other very limited.<br />There is good quality, looks and amano made ​​reluctantly, but does not have defects that prevent their use.<br />The Positive:<br />Very good fit<br />Quality Neoprene<br />Generally well manufactured<br /><br />The Negative<br />Some holes are poorly cut<br />It is difficult to insert the mobile in tends to over time can damage the neoprene because it enters a tight hole.",3,2
"The battery on the transmitter would not charge up properly to show a green light, and there was a bad hissing sound constantly in the background.  I though it was because of the battery, but now I am wondering if the device had a volume knob, that the volume might have been set too high causing feedback, but since the battery was defective I didn't get to experiment with it..",3,2
"I received this product with a sticker on the side saying it was fully charged. It was not charged at all, so had to charge it first to use it. Also the connector for my cell phone broke after one use. I have contacted the company about my concerns/complaints and am working with them to resolve my concerns",3,2
"A month to ship, come on. It was tough holding off an impatient granddaughter off for this long.<br /><br />It was free guess I cannot complain too much.",3,2
"I'm sooo confused!!! I want it, but not sure exactly what it does. I want to be able to download the Andriod Market and be able to use them!(games) I don't want it to mess up my Nook Tablet, does anyone think that Barns and Noble will make one of thier own???? HELP ME PLEASE SOMEBODY!!!!!!!!!",3,1
"Quality is just fair.  I gave this kit as a gift so I do not know how the car charger works yet but I did see the case, wall charger and screen protector.  The screen protector did not go on well for the iTouch 4th generation. The charger is cheap and does not stay in the wall and the case is just okay. I would not buy this again.",3,2
"This is a good camera to start with to find out what this type of device will and will not do. These cameras on video capture more images than a person has time to review.  On still photo, they get images of real value. Will continue to look at the market for a really good still image snap camera. i have two of these little cameras, they do not work below 40`F.",3,1
"Product is exactly as written in discription but the quality sucks. Its only been less than two weeks and the product is falling appart. Also, it doesn't hold the itouch well so it slides causing the picture to have part of the blue covering the camera.",3,2
The case is fine. It is nothing special. There is nothing wrong with it. It is of average quality as expected.,3,2
TAKES TOO MUCH POWER FOR FULL RMS..14.4 IS TOO MUCH FOR 2400..OR 2621 FINAL RMS @2OHMS.. im pushin a XXX 18 RE AUDIO D4...ITS OK.. NOT BAD.. BUT NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!! SENING IT BACK!...P.S A 14VOLT BATTERY COST $260..XS POWER...UR NOT RUNNING THIS AMP ON STOCK POWER!!! THIS IS FOR US BIG BOYS!!!,3,2
Not a DOD brand as stated but works good any way. Video is not excellent but is as good as expected.,3,1
I still could not get volume from my TV but I could hear it when I moved the connectors in the back of the TV,3,2
"It's okay, for the price and the extended wait for the item,it's not bad, but the item did go out on me after 3months of use.",3,1
"I was looking to install an inexpensive rearview mirror replacement with a LCD/TFT display and mirror combo. My vehicle did not originally come with a rear camera/lcd/tft monitor. I had a rear camera installed with a dash mounted 4.3\\"" tft display. I was looking for a mirror/monitor combo replacement for the dash mounted display.  This product DOESN'T fit the requirements. It is a large 7\\"" TFT/LCD display that is non mirror reflective (It doesn't have a mirror reflective surface). I have attached a couple of photos to demonstrate the size difference between a regular sized rear view mirror and this 7\\"" TFT display. You can also note that this display does not have a mirror reflective film.<br /><br />This is more of a visor display and comes with two long black nylon straps to mount it to a visor and possibly a mirror. This does have clips on back to mount it to a rear view mirror, but as mentioned before, the surface is non mirrored and you would not be able to see behind you when the camera/display is off.<br /><br />Pros: Large 7\\"" display with all included installation cables/wiring. Mounting straps for visor/mirror mount. Clamps/clips for holding it onto a rear view mirror. *I would only recommend this for a truck(delivery truck) that has the rear blocked. Not for a regular vehicle that you can see back through your rear view mirror.<br /><br />Cons: Non reflective (this can be fixed by applying a protective mirror reflective film like those sold for iPads )<br /><br />Additional comments: The product I received has one button that doesn't work. It is down and doesn't pop back up. I have not installed it so I cannot comment on the video clarity. Will attempt to return it to the amazon seller.",3,1
This product disappointed me because when I got it it was fine but after about 20 minutes the whole thing was scrached from being in my pocket. I was very disappointed.,3,2
"In daylight works exellent, but in dusk and night very poor. Night video on gopro 2 is far better than on cam which would be ok hd wise. Item i received would loop video in 2 min loops, wouldn't set 5 or 10 min loops. Setting up cam vas very easy unlike other reviewers, no need for manual.",3,2
"I bought this for my harley, and although it looks great, its very hard to see the display, the words are very faint gry/blue on black background. I do like the bluetooth features but seem to loose signal quite often as it takes cell tower signal.",3,1
Didn't fit quit right to my handle bars.,3,2
"Picks up plenty of FM stations.  SW not that important to me although I did Beijing China, will try at a later date to explore this function. The MP3 port did not work, it did recognize the thumb drive but would not play any of my music.  I tried everything using different thumb drives nothing worked.  If this is important to you consider another radio.  Its a small radio very portable, would be handy in emergency situations.  Also liked that it has a lithium ion battery and also can use 3 AA batteries if desired.  If the MP3 was functioning I would give a higher rating.",3,2
"I got a refurbished one for listening to audio books. The forward and back buttons don't work, so I can't back up and start a chapter over again. Oh well, it keeps me moving through the books faster.<br /><br />I've had five of these or more, and I really like them, but I won't buy another refurbished one.",3,1
We'll it's really pretty and I lke it and all but it breaks VERY easily mines had all ready cracked in the first week and a half then the next four days it chipped a big piece for. The back and now it broke off the whole side<br />And it's useless now and I have only had it for about a month,3,2
"I purchased this unit to hold my iPod Touch 3G.    Pros:  - The transmitter functions better than any of the many previous ones I have owned.  - Holds my iPod securely, even in the Otterbox case (it *is* a very tight fit)  - Gooseneck stays in the position you put it in.  - Remote works well when then 30 pin connector is used    Cons:  - Transmitter resets to 88.1 when it loses power instead of keeping the last channel selected  - High pitched whine/hum when using the 30 pin connector *  - Cheap (worthless) 3.5mm cable **  - Unable to turn holder sideways for horizontal use  - Seems to be a rather sloppy fit in the cigarette lighter    * This may be the electronics in my vehicle... I've ordered an inline noise filter I'll be installing soon.  I'll report back on the success or failure of that.    ** The cable broke the second day.  It was in the car overnight, the temps got down to about 10 and when I got in the next morning and plugged my iPod in, the connector snapped completely off of one end.  The rubber/plastic had gone from fairly supple to almost completely rigid, and the miniscule wires inside were nowhere near big enough to withstand the strain with the jacket broken... this seems like a rather serious failing for an item meant to be used in vehicles that might be unheated for great lengths of time.",3,2
"it fits good, however the screen still flickers pink. Maybe the part is not as good, or there might be something else wrong with laptop, not sure",3,2
Very comfortable for workout gym .. jog etc. Comes with a nice arm band; only con this cover attracts dust lint very easily..,3,1
I use this radio on my porch.  Its ok for that purpose.  but the sound quality sucks.,3,2
"The package came several days earlier than promised which was great.  The \\""Crystal Case\\"" fits the 4th generation - but isn't compatible the power button is covered and the lens for the camera is covered so pictures are distorted.  After reading some reviews I'm tentative to use the flip cover as I don't want to have to re-store my Itouch.  I'm hoping some of the cords work better than previously reviewed.",3,1
I bought this for my 7 and 3 year old and they both don't like it. i don't think it stayed in place very well.,3,1
"The price and great shipping time was wonderful on this product, but it wasn't what I expected.  I thought it was a totally enclosed case but it is just a hard skin shell for it.  I was dissappointed because it still leaves the front open and not protected, so you will still need a case for the nook. If that is what you are looking for, then the product is great and the design is beautiful!",3,1
"this product is cute and functional, but has some flaws. it is well padded as described and has an average sized armband. it is actually a little big for my arm, but I am very petite. my iPod fits in the holder with it's case still on, which is convenient.  however, the plastic screen protector is pretty thick, making it hard to use your iPod at times. tapping is easy, but sliding to unlock or adjust volume is nearly impossible. also, the top of the holder is open, where it is possible, though highly unlikely, for your iPod to fall out. I haven't had this problem yet though. and lastly, a rather serious flaw that I discovered is that there is no hole for your earbuds to plug into your iPod.  a stupid mistake in design. however, an easy fix. I simply extended the already existing hole using scissors.  overall, for the price, a good buy. :)",3,1
"UPDATED 1/14/2015<br />Today this is no longer the best car DVR. The image quality is now considered subpar and reliability of the unit has been questionable, occasionally it would stop recording and require reset. I've switched to newer and cheaper unit which outperforms this for half the price Mini 0806. It doesn't have wifi, so you'll stick with LCD screen, but IQ is much improved, especially at night. If you prefer unit with wifi I would recommend SJCam 5000+. Also downgrading this review to a 3 stars.<br /><br />UPDATED 4/12/2013<br /><br />Upgraded to latest firmware 1.0.5, but didn't notice any new features or improvements. Also switched to using 32GB card and now on a few occasions it wouldn't record. I have to unplug the camera power to start recording again. WiFi feature maybe selling point, but I haven't used it in 2 month. The video feed is choppy and with delay when using live view feature. I covered silver accents with black tape, looks tacky, but at least it doesn't stand out as much now.<br /><br />Virus issues: There were reports that there is a virus on the sd card from this seller. I have not had this issue because I purchased this from another source, but prior to upgrade my blackvue to 1.0.3 I've actually formatted the card, so I don't know if I had the virus or not.<br /><br />I've been using different DVRs over the years, mostly Chinese made, this is first Korean DVR and this is the first one that actually I really like and it addressed most of my previous concerns:<br /><br />THE GOOD<br />- Compact, simple, non distracting design and solid quality feel<br />- No built-in display, it's substituted with WiFi connection to your smartphone which becomes DVR display. Love this feature! Keep in mind there is about 1-2 second delay in the live image. You can also stream live video to a browser without using any apps, simply by entering the following url in the browser (without spaces) h t t p:// 192 .168 .8 .1 / blackvue_live.cgi.<br />- Excellent daylight quality<br />- Low profile mount, but see cons<br />- Parking mode motion sensor, haven't tried yet<br />- Bunch of venting holes for hot climates, I haven't tried it in the hot weather, but it doesn't seem like it would have any issues as previous model<br />- Voice notifications, fun to have at first, but I would rather turn them off<br />- Extra wide angle, you will most likely see the A pillars in your car. If you turn it facing inside the car you will see the sides of the front windows which may be handy, but the image doesn't flip over.<br />- Very easy to view your recordings on a smartphone. (I only tried Android app)<br />- Included wire management clips, nice addon<br />- IR sensor to turn on/off microphone. Interesting feature, but I don't see any practical use to turn off microphone.<br /><br />THE NOT SO PRETTY<br />- Night quality still has plenty of room for improvement, but overall it's definetely better then most cheap DVRs I've tried<br />- Some minor user interface glitches in the Android app, hopefully will be resolved in the future updates<br />- A bit pricey when there are plenty of HD cameras that cost less<br />- Silver accents are noticeable. Blackboxes should be All-Black-Boxes, but nothing that black tape or marker can't fix.<br />- Design does not allow you to move the camera horizontally<br />- No built in battery, there is however some sort of capacitor that serves purpose of allowing the cam to save the file correctly when there is no power.<br />- Standard bitrate is a bit low at 7000, but with some modding (search forums) you can increase it up to 15000<br />- I've been having mixed feelings with the mount. On one had I understand the stick on clip design, but I prefer non permanent solutions, like suction cups. Also removal of the DVR is a bit cumbersome. You have to first unplug power then click the button to unlock and only then you can remove it from the mount.<br />- It does get warm a bit to the touch, but venting holes help to cool it down fast after powering down.",3,1
I order this jacket based on another one I own for an older Nook.  my original one held the Nook with a soft padded backing a four formed corners of the same material.  it had a clear cover and a full zipper which I really liked for protection.  this new case does have the same type zipper but it holds the Nook with four corners of some type of acrylic.  the corners do not really hold the Nook very well.  I even took it to Barnes & Noble to see if I was attaching it incorrectly.<br />I did keep the jacket even though it doesn't hold the Nook well because of the padding and zipper.  would love the old design back.,3,1
"The description is completely different than the product I received. The description says that it has slots for credit cards and that it can be folded over so you can watch movies while it's still in the case. However, that is not the case. There are no slots and if you flip the side over, your ipod will fall out.  Also, the lock button is really hard to slide because part of the case is in the way.  Also, I have the 160GB 7th generation ipod classic and it is a little too thin for this case.",3,2
"It works fine, but feels like cheep plastic.  I also find it obnoxious that the free app to work with it has ads in it.  If I paid for your physical product, don't force me to look at ads when I use it. That's just uncool.  If it didn't have the ads, I'd give it 4 stars.",3,1
"Fit fine, until you try to use the charger.",3,2
"Decent mp3 player, but cannot download any android aps because it does not have internet capability. The \\""directions\\"" are written in Japanese- directions are not yet available on line.  Even without directions, I was able to download music.  It seems easy to operate.",3,2
"Note that this is NOT a PARAMETRIC EQ, it is actually a GRAPHIC EQ!  What is really odd, is that there are 4 bands for the front, and 3 DIFFERENT bands for the REAR speakers.  This may work fine depending on the applications, but to have different frequencies for front and rear is really strange.  Now, if I could actually find a decent PARAMETRIC EQ for the price, and especially one with 7 bands!  (PARAMETRIC EQs also allow you to pick the frequency that you are going to boost/cut, and better ones allow you to select the &#34;Q&#34; factor, or width and slope of the effected frequncy band.)",3,1
"Good case if you are not looking for fancy. Magnetic snap closure could be stronger and the stylus is way to small for my big hands. Top, bottom and side are designed to where you can charge it, plug in headphones, turn it off or adjust the volume. Took a while to get it, company said the shipping label tore and had to reship, took about 3 weeks to get here. The headphones have a good sound. Have not used the car charger yet.",3,1
"Ships from across seas and takes around 50 days to receive. Setting up is a bit of a pain in the rear. GPS works great so far. Nice large screen. DVR function is neat,  its like the videos you see on TV taken from a police car. Wireless camera works well. *Bluetooth * function is only to pair your phone for phonecalls and text. Cannot transfer music, pics, or video without a computer with a USB. FM transmitter works OK. Device advertises voice control....no such thing on this device. No WiFi but can connect like a home computer wired direct to your existing computer. User manual is 16 small pages that look like they were photocopied to make a cheap booklet that doesn't cover much. For the money its a great GPS and rear camera. As a tablet...you get what you pay for. All in all I'm satisfied. As I said it is hard to configure. I am very familiar with technology but still ran into issues getting advanced features and options to work.",3,1
"A+ on the design, the sound quality however is a c-, I was very disappointed ultimately by the level of volume. the sound was a bit unidirectional but I would have been able to live with that for 4 or 5 more beeps on the + sound button. If they come out with a larger more powerful model I may try them again.",3,1
Love the color and love the idea of having different positions as an option.<br />However it's not sturdy or strong.  Parts of it are falling off.  Stand is weak and falls down sometimes.,3,1
"Ordered this and installed in my car about a year ago.  Took some minor adjusting to get it to fit right.  Seemed like very good quality out of the box.  But the problem with RCA is that if it's not ordered by an authorized RCA retailer then they will not honor any warranty.  Needless to say the unit I received was in need of such service.  So let's begin with the PROS:  The usb mp3 player is a great idea and what sold me on this unit.  Not that I ever expected to detach it and go for a jog with it but the ability to record a song off the radio and then take it home and put it on your computer is super cool.  It's why I purchased this unit and why, despite it's flaws I would actually purchase this unit again without a second thought.  I am not an audiophile while driving.  I am at home but in my car I have the windows down and am typically in my car primarily to get from point A to points B and beyond.  So my needs were for a nice sounding unit with upgrade capability if later deemed necessary.  That was my basic need which just about every car stereo out there matched.  Beyond that I wanted knobs.  I hate buttons for volume and tuning.  I'm 30 so I'm still on the knob side of technology.  They just plain work better.  And they are much better suited for driving than a button barely the size of my finger nail.  For the most part all of the controls make sense.  It also comes with a remote that is a great size with all the features you'd need without a plethora of unnecessary buttons.  But it is not needed for any function that the radio's direct interface can't navigate.  Now for the CONS:  The mp3 player is absolute rubbish.  Don't expect to use it for anything at all besides recording that rare song or newsbyte.  If NPR is your thing it would be very well suited.  But the audio quality is really sub-par.  Also the CD player tends to almost eat CDs.  In fact I don't even carry a single CD in the car anymore because of how bad it is.  The interface mostly makes sense but of course if I were to design the layout I would pretty much change everything.  The only thing I would keep is the one-knob-per-side layout.  A classic that I still think is the way to go.  Sound manipulation is limited to balance - bass - treble - fader.  Nothing spectacular but good enough for me and my stock Toyota speakers.    BOTTOM LINE:  A great idea with poor execution.  I would buy this again only because I don't think anybody else has done this.  The idea of a built in detachable mp3 player that charges itself as you drive seems very basic but still I have yet to see another one.  And at this point not having one would really irk me.  If you do buy this make sure it's through an RCA retailer.  Based on how many things were/are wrong with mine you're probably gonna need it.",3,1
"It doesn't seem to clip on in any good way, that doesn't interfere with my nook.  I have used it, and wouldn't say no to anybody thinking of buying one. It is adequate.",3,2
The craftsmanship is not good. The places where the groove and the holes are not clean and have shards of wood seen visibly.,3,1
"It's a very cool key, but it took some time to get it together correctly. It is definitely not well built at all and you are getting a cheap product. Feels very flimsy and not well built at all. I like it, but it could have been built better!",3,2
It works OK but does not provide all functions via the remote. You cannot FF or REW in a track - only skip forward and back. No track info displayed either.,3,2
"This product is alright. I've never bought a case/screen protector. And I had trouble reading the instructions for installing the screen protector. The directions are difficult, well no; the directions are NOT clear. However, if one has never \\""installed\\"" a screen protector, one can look it up on Youtube. Type \\""PhoneBuff\\"" and look for his video (How to Put on a Screen Protector Without Bubbles). Quite helpful! On a better note, I received this product one day after ordering it. So that was pretty cool.",3,1
"The screen protectors are really easy to apply (do not have to be too precise to get it on), but they get easily scratched and also don't fit 100%, they are little longer, so when I apply my next one (am through 2 in 3 weeks or so), I am gonna cut the top a little bit.<br /><br />But for the price a great deal",3,1
These Screen Protectors are a mid priced protector and you get what you pay for!<br />They are fairly easy to apply and reasonably clear!<br />They have not been as rugged as more higher price protectors I have used!<br />Since it is a multi pack they can be replaced when needed!<br />Thay work as promised and a good budget/mid priced Screen Protector!<br />I would buy them again if they were all I could afford!,3,1
I thought it comes with the manual how to wire it like colorcode for signal ;stop. But its ok looks good.,3,1
"My desk at work is on the ground floor in the center of the building.  Zero or one bar.  If my iPhone rang at all, I'd have to literally run for the exit to hold the call.  Now, with this device, I can make it work.  I have it propped straight up on my desk (this case has a flat bottom) and leave the earphone connected; if I use the earphone to answer the call without touching the phone, things seem to work OK.",3,2
This transmitter worked about 1 year and now it's useless for me as cannot read the flash drive anymore...<br /><br />The player itself was acceptable. The disadvantes for me were that it always reverted to the first song and the first frequency. So every time I needed to setup(or leave original) frequency and start listening from the first song(or manually go to the song X). Also it was impossible to use audio connection from my player/phone as the quality was bad for some reason.,3,2
All I really wanted was a cheap mp3 player with alot of memory and thats what I got. So i'm pleased with my purchase.,3,1
Decent Bluetooth speaker for the price. I give it 3 stars only because it's not that loud and you can't be more than 10ft away from your connected device before it starts to lose connection. Works with my iPhone and PC via Bluetooth. Can also be used with the included cable as it has an auxiliary/micro/standard USB plugs.,3,1
"First of all, let me say that if you plan on not keeping your Nook in a case this is pretty much useless, in my opinion.  The front of the skin fits very nicely, sticks great & is exactly as they show it.  The back, however, doesn't even come close to fitting & just looks ridiculous.",3,1
"I did look for ever for a case for my kids Itouch, they came fast and for the price that I paid? can get better<br />Great seller and product",3,1
"The dock itself works okay. To put it in and pull it out from the port needs a bit time.  Remote is not working fine.  Overall, it's a good deal for a reasonable price like this.",3,1
"Received cord but the iPhone fitting is very tight and requires more than a gentle push to plug into phone. I have not used with the attached charger but with another one. Will update later.  Nothing spectacular. 2 meters long, white wire, fittings on both ends.",3,2
"my daughter will love it - while not the best, I definitely got the most for what I paid.",3,1
"It's a good product. found the instructions online on how to remove and replace the screen. the only thing that bothered me about this particular replacement screen was the fact that it was very fragile. even though it was in my pocket, I noticed the screen started cracking a bit and some of the pixels in it started dying. that could have easily been my fault but i think these things should be durable. in my opinion get it but be careful when handling it.",3,1
"Ensure the instructions are in English, I enjoy the aspect of ordering products from other countries but I warn consumers you may wish to ensure the product comes from America not an America company that sells foreign goods in a foreign language. Well it has been about 5 weeks now and many features of this product is unknown to me, the reason is that the entire instructions came written in Chinese. True there is a menu in english, however try to seek selections of the menu and it is written in Chinese. There is a menu for movies, but it is in Chinese. There is a menu for the equilzer, it is in Chinese. The device does play ok but because the fine tuning is in Chinese, I do not know what I am doing. I can not load movies because the instructions are in Chinese. Although the product does state it can do a lot of things that most people are interested in even the instructions were too brief. With everything that the device says it can do there are only 12 lines of instruction. Unless the entire Chinese language is in picture/letters, I would hardly doubt that even if I did speak/read Chinese that the brief instructions would explain the full features of the product. I think I will choose a Sony or other companies that sell their oversees products in a language of the people to whom will use their product. I will keep this until I reorder a different product with instructions in English. Then I will toss it.",3,2
"Works well and easy to upload files directly to the device.    Remembers frequency but does NOT remember the place in the song when disconnected.  Have yet to use the remote since it is hardly necessary when you are right next to it in your car.  Since it doesn't remember the place of the song, it would be far cheaper to by a cheaper device and a SD card.  Though it is somewhat handy to not have to worry about carrying a card or losing it.",3,1
"I needed a tablet holder for a certain backseat passenger and figured this would work since the reviews were good.<br /><br />This has been used to hold an iPad Mini Retina and a Toshiba Thrive (yes it's old, but it works!).<br /><br />The mounting is actually pretty good - they include two rubber \\""collars\\"" that attach to your headrest post (with different diameters) then you clip the plastic base around it.  That part stays pretty securely in a few different cars that I've tried.<br /><br />There's a ball-joint in the rear of the main tablet support that allow you to angle the tablet and twist to secure it in that position.  That works decently well also but it doesn't \\""lock\\"" the thing from moving completely - it's just more secure than loosely flopping around.<br /><br />The tablet support itself can slide up and down (making fun ratchet-y sound!) so the tablet can be higher or lower on the support post.  It's probably best to leave it low since this part isn't that secure.  Eventually the tablet will \\""drop\\"" down to the lowest setting and surprise you with an unexpected ratchet-y sound.<br /><br />The tablet support that actually holds the tablet has a spring-loaded arm at the top and an adjustable arm at the bottom.  The point of the bottom arm is that it's supposed to stay stationary (there's a small button that's supposed to allow you to move it up and down - release it to hold it in that position) while the spring-loaded top arm holds the tablet in via tension.  You can insert/remove your tablet by pulling/pushing the spring-loaded arm.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the lower arm doesn't hold securely with heavier tablets or regular tablets + \\""spirited driving\\"".  This could be a combination of the spring-loaded arm being under too much tension + \\""spirited driving\\"".  I've heard the dreaded ratchet (yes, when the stationary arm breaks its hold, it also makes that ratchet-y sound) while cornering which resulted in a dropped tablet and an unhappy rear seat passenger.

"Before I had a wireless transmitter..it lasted for quite a while, but then the wire slowly was coming out and stopped working a few days ago. NOW THIS ONE is nice. The only thing I have a problem about is that when it's not playing a song it makes this annoying buzz sound..but when it is playing a song there is no buzz sound.",3,2
The mic is barely above standard mic and earpieces that I have had for lower prices. It is bulky and fragile. You have to fiddle with the connection s at times also,3,2
"NOTE: this review is TL;DR. But you may find it helpful to you.<br /><br />Keep in mind that this is not exactly a full-fledged tablet. If you want something as nifty as an iPad or the Galaxy Tab, then this isn't for you. It's more like a Kindle or Nook on steroids.<br /><br />I got this yesterday, so I'm still exploring some things.<br /><br />STRENGTHS: great price, small compact size, can read pdfs, great downloaded video playback, GetJar compatible, included ereader app smooth, included task killer/manager, wi-fi decent, fast charging on AC adapter, light-weight, sharp image viewing/resolution<br /><br />WEAKNESSES: no camera, needs touch to be calibrated, no Google Play support, speed not very fast, typing issues (use fingernails or a stylus), no video out or hdmi out, included file manager is unintuitive, no Nook/Kindle compatibility<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />TIPS:<br /><br />It's not extremely fast, but it gets the job done. Make sure you calibrate the touch settings first. You can do this by: -Pressing the HOME button (the one that looks like a house). -Go to SETTINGS. -Tap on TOUCH PANEL CALIBRATION. -Follow the instructions.  If you do this, it'll make your life much easier with this device.<br /><br />I don't really like the included software suite (OfficeSuite). You can view Microsoft Office files, but you can't edit them unless you purchase the activation (~$15). Download Kingsoft Office instead. It's free, and you can actually edit and create new documents and such on it. Make sure you SAVE your work, kay guys?<br /><br />The included file explorer (EXPLORER) is not that great. I recommend downloading FILE EXPERT from the installed APPOKE MARKET. To use the APPOKE Android market, you'll need to register.<br />***This tablet is not compatible with the Google Play Android market.***  You cannot download the market app nor download apps from the Google Play website. I personally called Google Play Customer Support, and they specifically told me that the EMATIC EBW404 is +NOT+ supported by Google Play. My wish is that they add support soon. The APPOKE market isn't as comprehensive as the Google Play market. If you want more apps than APPOKE has available, might I suggest downloading the GETJAR app market? Most are free, and a lot of the same apps are in the Google Play market.<br /><br />I had some trouble watching YOUTUBE on the mobile website and the desktop version as well. I recommend downloading TUBEMATE from GETJAR. You don't necessarily have to +download+ videos with TUBEMATE; it lets you watch videos.<br /><br />As far as the eReader is concerned: ***you won't be able to read Nook or Kindle ebooks on this.***  It has KOBO, its own ebook store. Some are free, some aren't. Try to find another third-party app that sells epub or pdf formats, as the built-in book reader will recognize pdf. NOTE: when you first try to directly open an epub ebook, you'll get a message that says \\""no handler\\"" or something that says that there's no installed app to open it. Here's how to work around that: -If you downloaded the FILE EXPERT app from APPOKE, tap on FILE EXPERT from the menu (after pressing the HOME button, the one shaped like a house). -Tap on MY FILES. -Go to SD CARD (this is where you find files you uploaded from your computer via USB to your tablet, regardless of whether you have a MICRO SD card physically installed). -Scroll down with your finger until you find the desired file (in this case, I used the included ebook <Alice in Wonderland.epub>). -DON'T TAP, but HOLD DOWN your finger or stylus on the file for 2-3 seconds. A menu \\""FILE OPERATIONS\\"" will appear. Easiest to see all of it in PORTRAIT view (long and skinny view). - Tap on MORE... Another menu, OPERATION, will appear. -Tap on OPEN WITH. Another menu appears. -Tap on MORE... -Yet another menu appears. Different apps and options will appear on the menu. -Tapon EBOOKREADER. -Enjoy the book.<br /><br />***Be sure you charge the tablet when you open it from the box.***  The battery initially doesn't have a whole lot of charge. It charges fastest when you use the included AC adapter.<br /><br />Sometimes, like any other computer or electronic device, it freezes. Turn the tablet over.  About an inch diagonal from the mini USB port is a small hole. That's the reset button. It's pretty small, so you'll need something like a sewing needle or a really skinny paper clip or safety pin. Don't press really hard. If the object won't fit, don't force  it. Find something else that'll fit in the hole. Press for 2-3 seconds. You may have to reboot the tablet.<br /><br />Typing can be an issue. It takes a bit getting used to. Typing is easiest in LANDSCAPE view (longways/horizontal).<br /><br />If the tablet seems slow, use the included ADVANCED TASK MANAGER. Memory is limited, so be judicious with the apps you simultaneously have open.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Here are the apps that I got preinstalled on the device:<br />-ADVANCED TASK MANAGER<br />-ALARM CLOCK<br />-APPOKE MARKET<br />-AUDIO PLAYER<br />-BOX.NET<br />-BROWSER<br />-CALCULATOR<br />-DAILY PAPER<br />-EASY INSTALLER<br />-EASY UNINSTALLER<br />-EMAIL<br />-EXPLORER<br />-KOBO<br />-OFFICESUITE<br />-PHOTOS<br />-SETTINGS<br />-SOUND RECORDER<br />-VIDEO<br />Sorry, no Google Play Android app market.",3,1
"An excelent product to protect you iPod nano, good leather quality, protects your screen and allows for multiple positioning on the belt since the belt clip rotates 360 degrees.<br />However you have to apply a small adderent transparent film on your screen in order to protect it (included), since there is no transparent plastic on the case, i would have prefered as part of the case.<br />Also the edges of the iPod are a bit unprotected, all 4 edges can be seen and are unprotected, if you drop it and it lands on one of the corners, the ipod WILL get a scratch because the case borders dont stick out enought nor do they cover them.",3,1
"This cable hasn't been subjected to much use, but what little I've used it, it's worked as needed. So far, it seems like this is a good value as far as third-party charging cables go.",3,1

"It may be tough, but it isn't for someone who wants to constantly insert/remove their reader. On first read, I didn't quite get how this case works. What the user does is add on two strips onto their reader, and those strips are a super strong hook/loop fastener (like the stuff you can get from radio shack). I pressed the material into the receiver strip, and it was difficult to get off. If you want something that will be semi-permanent, and are OK w/ sticking something onto your device, the Book Armor is a good choice. Not quite want I wanted, though, because I will be inserting/removing the device constantly.",3,1
Good,3,1
I want to know will this led car interior dome light work in my 2006 malibu,3,1
I bought this for my daughter's Itouch and she can rip the thing off too easily.  This cover doesn't really stay snug on the Itouch and is made of cheap material.  I'd recommend using otterbox instead.,3,2

"I like to listen to music when I go camping but often run out of battery life on my pioneer inno. I thought this would be a decent product to own so that I would be able to continue to listen to music. It uses four AA batteries. I used two sets of rechargeable batteries (fully charged) to test it out and both times the radio continued to play for a little over an hour. So it's not a bad product but I guess I was foolish in thinking that the 4 AA batteries would give me a couple of hours of juice, not just one.  If I had to do it over, for the price, I would pass.",3,2
this was purchased for my mother and she has passed away and never had the opportunity to use it. we are giving it to the nursing home for them to give to someone.,3,2
"At first it was excellent, it played everything well. The only problem is that it isn't as simple as just plugging it in and turning it on. You have to press a play button for a few seconds. After about a week to two weeks, it only works if the chord is in a certain position. I wont be buying a replacement.",3,1
The arm is kinda short which makes it difficult to angle your iPad.  The Mount itself seems sturdy and doesn't shake too much.,3,1
"Works great, but cover must be removed to use and It is not real sturdy! I had to prop my IPad against something so it would not fall!",3,1
"It was good while it worked  It had no problems playing songs from the usb.  It could easily play over any station, if there was interference I just switched to another station.  And it does have a random option, just press and hold the play button on the remote and you'll see \\""all\\"" on the  screen, press and hold again \\""one\\"" will show, do it one more time and \\""ran\\"" will come up for random.  But, it tends to heat up causing the small srcreen to blur after about an hour and a half of use, so I just  unplugged it and waited a few minutes for it to cool down and it was fine.  One time while I was getting out of my car it fell on the floor from my lap, and that was it, it would not  work anymore. Too bad for such a great little mp3 player. Only had it for about two months.  So be warned it is very fragile, handle with care.",3,1
"It does what they say it does. As you exit your vehicle, touch this on the vehicle before you physically touch it, and it discharges the static build-up.  The catch is, you have to remember to do this. But it does work, but so does a regular, plain key. What you are discharging is the static you have built up on your person, (clothes etc) as you move around on your seats. As this item is quite inexpensive, about the only drawback is that you have to wait three or so weeks for it to ship from China. So if you need another item to put on your key chain that looks interesting, go for it.",3,1
MP3 is fine. FM reception is poor; too much static noise; could not get clear station unless you have to stand still.  Controls are very confusing and the user manual does not help much.,3,2

"This cable works fine if you want to connect and listen to your  music on your ipod, I tried to connect my iphone 4 and I got to play music from it, my only complain is it didnt charge my iphone and it said in the description that it will charge iphones once connected.",3,1
"I have purchased two of these cables within one year of each other.  The idea of a retractable cable is great, but it just wasn't a very good quality cable.  This cable stayed strictly in my car hooked up to a USB cigarette lighter charger thing, and both that I purchased wore out very quickly, one in 4 months and the second one in about 8.  In both of them, the plastic part that plugs into the Zune actually just fell apart in my hands, and the bare wires were exposed and I was afraid of being shocked.  If you want an inexpensive cable, this is definitely an option, but don't expect quality.",3,2
"I bought this off of a different site tanga.com that normally has it listed around $14+ shipping.<br /><br />I love the concept and the sound that comes out of it is much better than I expected. I especially wasn't expecting any bass from this little unit but depending on the surface some of the lower sounds are quite decent. Not a subwoofer by any means but good low midrange sound.<br />2ndly, the sound carries pretty well. I normally have this set up on the bathroom counter below the mirror while I shave and get ready for the day and notice that if I walk out of the bathroom the wall behind the mirror is also putting off sound. It would be an interesting concept to be able to daisy chain these together.<br /><br />Hollow items like doors seem to work better than solid surfaces. The solid counter top has a deeper, fuller sound but is also slightly muffled. Placing it on a pulled out, empty drawer (thin wooden bottom) is a much better sound but you lose the bottom end.<br /><br />The only part that is really bad on this is the battery life. I've tried leaving it on the charger all day, or for a few hours, and when I go back it'll only play for a few minutes or not at all unless it's plugged in.",3,1
"It is  okay my GPS fit very well in the case,  So far, it is working out great for my GPS 9250T-LM",3,1

"[[VIDEOID:1ae21e9bbe62e359707f17eb50db85d0]] 🎬 Video Review 🎬<br /><br />✏️ Plus Bonus Top 5 Beau Thoughts:<br /><br />1⃣ Easy install. Took less than 4 minutes.<br />2⃣ Requires a micro SD card. I used this one: [[ASIN:B00M55C0NS SanDisk Ultra 32GB UHS-I/Class 10 Micro SDHC Memory Card With Adapter- SDSDQUAN-032G-G4A [Old Version]]]. It works perfectly.<br />3⃣ Reason for the 3 stars: when attempting to press the menu button, it takes quite a while to activate. (we're talking a frustrating long time...) There are simply other dash cams out there in the same price range that work.<br />4⃣ Delay shut-off time.  I like this feature, and it shows up here and there in other dash cams as well. This features allows the camera to continue recording for 30-ish seconds after you shut off the power (your car).  Smart idea since accidents can still happen if your is at a stand-still with the ignition off.<br />5⃣ Video files: It records to AVI files that play natively on a Mac. This is nice because other dash cams I've tested record to a weird codec (still AVI video though) and have to be converted prior to playing.  If you can't play the video files, use VLC Player (free download).<br /><br />If you're curious every 60 seconds of footage uses about 200mbs of memory.<br /><br />Hope this is helpful! Note the company sent me this product to demonstrate on video and offer my personal opinion. I don't work for them, nor am I paid anything that might sway my personal opinion of this product's performance.<br /><br />📍 Bottom line: would I recommend this product to one of my friends?<br />- No, not really. There are other more reliable options out there in the same price range.",3,1
I bought this because i thought it would be awesome and that it would protect my ipod. but that didnt happen. It fell out of my pocket and in the left hand corner is a shaderd spot. this case is no worth buying if your looking for protection,3,2
"It was pretty good until it cracked when I installed it, very cheap material. The original iPod screen is way better than this. Very worth the price.",3,2
"Hollow sounding.  Lots of background amplification.  But, the people I got them for are hard of hearing and they like them some.",3,1
"Works well and sounds good.  I wouldn't call them &#34;super bass,&#34; but for the price they work well.",3,1
Product description DOES NOT match what I received. Output is supposed to be adjustable by 6 stages but I only have 3.. Says it has 2 cooling fans & shows 2 cooling fans but only has one on the top of the case.Front label shows it as a Black Cat 500 & not a KL505 from RM Italy,3,2
"First off, the vendor sent me a BLACK case instead of the GRAPHITE colored case I ordered, so I cannot comment on the graphite color.  For what you get, you are better off ordering a cheaper soft rubber case for a fraction of what this case costs.  After receiving it, I don't see how this case is any better than cheaper rubber cases on offer at Amazon.com.  This case does have molded grips on the side, but that is hardly worth the much higher cost.",3,2
"the case was as pictured... but NOT REAL LEATHER. its made of the same material cheap shoes from payless are made of. that knocks one star off. the case doesnt stay closed when the ipod is in it. hopefully its just because its still fresh and stiff (giggity) and it still needs to be broken into. but until then, that knocks off another star. all in all, you may be really happy with it, seeing as how i'm pretty picky. and you cant complain about the price either.",3,2
"I got the pink one and the color is more like a bright neon pink than what it show on the web site. It fits ok and as most of the hard case, it won't cover all the way up the front four corners. Plus, due to the thickness of the case, it's hard to puch the volume up/down botton. Other than that... its cute.",3,1
"I was not expecting much, but I was expecting to shuffle my music if I wanted to.  No shuffling feature",3,1
"I like the case, nice feel to it.  Didn't fit my aux wire so I had to melt it, carve it, then sand it. After that, the case was perfect",3,1
The product came all black. No blue trim like the pic shows. Still a nice case...but would have been nice to have the blue trim. Which is why I ordered this one. I like blue : (,3,1
"The case does everything as promised, but be advised that the phone fits when it is NOT in a case.  I bought this product for my wife and she hardly uses it because she has to take her phone out of her case every time she wants to use it.",3,1
"As others have said, there are bits and pieces of this that works.  I have not had any problem charging the phones themselves from the AC adapter or the cable.  Unfortunately when I plug in a USB extension cable it will not charge the iPhone 4 or 4s.  It shows up that it is charging, but about 5-10 minutes later it will display that this accessory cannot be used for charging.  I have tried to mix the cables with the original iPhone AC adapters and I get the same result.  I would not recommend buying this product.  More proof that you get what you pay for.... I should have known.",3,2
The stereo is ok ... but it has a low volume legal .... plus the 3.5 input has trouble .... seem the . Insert plug in for the 3.5 is made just a little too big for most 3.5 cables .....  so when trying to record off a phone or tablet you frequently have to jiggle the cable in order to make sure it's connected ......,3,1
seems ok pulled a lot of stations sitting in the garage.,3,2
"I ordered two of these batteries for my old Zen Xtra.  As others have said, this battery is a fraction smaller than the original one and it will require a simple shim of some sort.  One could use a toothpick, a piece of plastic, or some strips of electrical tape attached to the end of the battery.  It's not really a big deal and otherwise these batteries work fine.  Considering that these Zen players are dinasaurs age-wise we're lucky to be able to find batteries at such a low price.  Actually my biggest complaint is the shipping costs from this company.  There is a fixed shipping rate per item which turned out to be a ridiculous amount for the two small batteries I ordered.  So the advertised price of this company's products is a bit of a farce but overall I was still happy to get the batteries.",3,1
"I was in a hurry and had been looking at many portable players with radio...thought this was a Magnavox, so that was a disappointment.  It works ok so far, decent radio reception, plays ipod nano and touch.  It does not seem to charge the ipod though which was also disappointing.  Also the power switch is touchy...works best for me if I use my fingernail instead of my finger.  Volume is pretty good for our small house.  It's decent for the price.  We have only had it 1 month.",3,1
"It does the job, but makes the phone lean very top-heavy on the speaker dock because it extends the phone up too high. So you have to be careful you don't accidentally break off the 30-pin connector built into the speaker dock!  If that happens, you're done. Also, a tablet device (iPad) would be much too heavy to use with this extender...you would most likely break off the 30-pin connector built into the speaker dock. The item is a great idea, and I'm keeping it, but just wish they didn't make it extend quite so long.",3,1
"GREAT SOUND,  I JUST WANT  TO KNOW WHY THE SPEAKER WON'T WORK WHEN THE CHARGER IS CHARGING AND YOU HAVE THE AUDIO,  DOES IT  NOT  WORK WITH BOTH PLUGGED IN  OR JUST WORKS WITH ONE OR THE OT HER",3,1
"Being so cheap, I guess I should have expected what I got. My biggest complaint is that it makes this clicking noise while the music is playing. Cheap or not, that is unacceptable.",3,2
The radio antenna doesn't get good reception. Otherwise I'd give it 4 stars,3,1
"Was prepared to be impressed but wasn't.  (Install some tweeters next time, NAD.)<br />You get a very collapsed image.  And the highs are hugely rolled off distractingly so.<br />For all the hype, the low frequency extension is the only thing noteworthy.<br /><br />Tested using digital optical.  The JBL Onbeat Xtreme beats it hands down.",3,1
Did not have hands-free operation as told by the company tech support.,3,2
"I've had a lot of trouble with Bluetooth so I went back to a wired earpiece.  Stereo so I could listen to music also.  This product is cheap and came in a set of three.  Good thing , too since the first pair broke almost immediately.  The second lost the ability for me to be heard and the third seems to work fine.",3,1
The software was not for kenwood radios like it said.,3,2
"The part is as described i guess, but it is a tad misleading because i thought it was an FM radio that attached to my ipod. It was probably my fault that i didnt research it enough but it would have been nice if it had been mentioned that it was NOT a radio. I am certain that i am not the first one that made this mistake. However it does do what it's supposed to do and the price was ok so i gave it 3 stars for that.",3,2
"Nice product and I love the color, but, the case does not close completely (about a centimeter short of locking in the back but the peices stay in place completely securing the phone.",3,1
I bought this product to have my cellphone play the part of an expensive bike computer as you can have apps on your smart phone.  is light and comfortable and easy to install.  the only problem is that the phone jumped out this device when I hit a bump in the road (I use this for my road bike).  To solve the problem I used a couple of elastic hair bands from my GF. to keep it in place.  Now that I solved the problem is really good to use on you bike with apps like cardio trainer.      The product is inexpensive and if you are willing to use some elastic bands it will work perfectly.,3,1
I expected alot more sound from these speakers as they are some low grade kickers not l7s I hooked up a 1600 watt autotek and lows are terrible I've heard it'smy amp so imI'm hooken up a 1500 watt planet audio to see if the tones get any better,3,2
bought this to take on a road trip with a friend to charge our iPhones. only one port worked so it didn't work out as i had hoped and by the time i got back to do an exchange/return it was past the 30 days.,3,2
"We purchased this radio for our 7 year old daughter. The music sounds good as long as your playing a cd. The reception on the radio part stinks even with the antenna all of the way up. We tried every station including AM and it still had static. The cd tray is also a little difficult for my daughter to operate. I guess it all goes back to \\"" you get what you pay for\\""",3,2
"I bought these for my girlfriend who decided they'd look nice on her recently bought ipod touch. I set them up and they looked good for a while, but when one of the corners started to peel off, that was the end of them.<br /><br />Please be advised hat these skins are for decorative purposes only, they do not offer any kind of protection to the ipod.",3,2
"Update: So I haven't really used this at all for almost 6 months now as the sound on my HTC One M7 (and now M8) android phone is good enough and much, much more easy to use and navigate music with. I should have purchased the Z2 Plenue or iAudio 10 instead. They really failed big time with the touch screen and interface.  As someone who has owned a couple of Cowon devices (the excellent X5 and the giant A3), I must say that I do like the D20, but I'm just a bit disappointed with a couple of things. The touch screen could be better, as well as the user interface. Other than that, it is a great portable music player.  Pros:  - Sound quality. Of course this is a Cowon device, so sound quality has to be excellent as always. As usual, you have your various presets (48 on this one, 4 of them being user presets that you can customize). Each user preset has a very customizable EQ, BBE, Mach3Bass, MP Enhance, Stereo Enhance, and Reverb effects. In short, the sound quality is brilliant as always on everything I've plugged it into (It actually made my cheap bluetooth/3.5mm speaker sound about 10 times better than it does when used with anything else).  - Size. Very compact and light. I was actually expecting this to be a bit closer to the size of the A3, which is huge. But instead I was pleasantly surprised that it's closer to the X5 in size. It isn't quite as thin as other players, but that has never really been a problem for me.  - Battery life. Well I can't really say anything about the full battery life being 90 hours, I have been using the player quite a bit for almost a week and the battery indicator has not dropped one bar.  - Expandable memory. Has an SD card slot, and yes, it does support Micro SD cards if anyone was wondering. I'm using a 32GB Micro SD card in the SD Adapter and it works fine. Apparently this will support up to 128GB.  - Codec support. As always with Cowon players, this will play pretty much any format you throw at it. It will not, however, play 24-bit/96khz FLACs. If you try to play them, the player will crash. Though 16-bit/44khz FLACs are perfectly fine, IMO, and are more common. Also, fully supports embedded album art and even .m3u playlists (Yay playlist support!).  - Standard Charging/Data port. Unlike some of the older models, this has a mini-USB port that can be used with any mini-USB cable, instead of some big adapter for a proprietary port like the X5 had.  - Other functionality. Plays videos (video player isn't great, but it works), displays pictures, displays documents and flash, has FM Radio that will work in various countries, records voice, line-in (needs an additional adapter), and FM Radio, has a notepad (the typing one works better as the touch screen isn't great for drawing), calculator, calendar, date/time, stopwatch, sleep mode, etc.  - Supports custom UIs. If you really hate the user interface (I've actually gotten used to it at this point), you can replace it with custom UIs that were made for the C2 that can be found on iAudio forums.  - Possible Rockbox support. I loved the Rockbox OS on the X5, and from what I've found there is a port for the D20 being developed at the moment.  Cons:  - Touch screen. Well, it's 2013 and this device still uses a resistive touch screen. I mean, it works, but it doesn't work as well as most capacitive touch screens. For instance, if you try to swipe, more than likely you'll randomly choose something you didn't want to choose. Sometimes where you press on the screen isn't completely accurate. Sometimes pressing on an icon will scroll the menu screen instead of choosing the icon that was pressed. Can be a bit annoying, but as someone who has used A LOT of touch screen devices, this one isn't all that bad.  - User Interface. Well.. when I first got the device, I absolutely hated it. The default theme has text and icons that are way too small, but some of the screens are pretty with their animations and whatnot. The secondary theme, IMO, is better in that ithas larger icons and more readable text, but for some odd reason, they decided to remove the nice animations and stuff from this theme. Doesn't make sense at all to me. Other than that, it can be a bit difficult at first to figure out where everything is, but after playing around with it for a while, I have gotten used to it, and it's not all that bad. Also as stated previously, there are a number of custom UIs available (but mainly just for the main screen, music player, and browser). Unlike most users, I actually like the spinning album art animation, but any of the custom music UIs will remove this if it annoys you.  - Buttons. While this isn't a huge con, it would be nice if it had actual Rew (Prev)/FF (Next) buttons along with the volume/Menu buttons. The workaround to this is that you can set the volume buttons to Rew (Prev)/FF (Next) if the screen is turned off and locked, as well as setting the menu button to play/pause (without having to do a long press).  Overall:  In conclusion, I am happy with the D20. It's definitely better than carrying around the giant A3, and the battery in my X5 is pretty much shot, so up to 90 hours of battery life is a beautiful thing. Also not having that stupid joystick thing is a plus. Sound quality, as always, is excellent, and sound options are VERY customizable for a portable device. Unfortunately, the UI could just be so much better than it is, and if they had included a better touch screen, I would have gladly payed a bit extra for it. But even with the cons, once you get used to everything, it really is a good portable music device. All the other features are kind of secondary and not done all that well, but if you're like most of Cowon's customers, you're going to mainly be using this for music anyway. And if the OS/UI is really bad to you, at least we can hope for a Rockbox port coming soon.",3,1
bought this for my little brother because his old one ripped and it charges but really REALLY slowly and when he's using the phone while charging it discharges but I guess that what you get for a generic cord.,3,1
"I own two Puxing Px-777 radios, which are also Chinese HTs, and I like them. So I'm not a radio snob or biased against these cheap hand-held radios in any way. But I wish that I had spent the extra money and got a Puxing PX-888K instead.<br /><br />I see nothing different with this new model as compared to an older model that I had on loan, other than the firmware revision level. No difference in features, operation or performance. I have had the UV-5RB for two weeks, and the speaker mic jack is already intermittent. If you do use a speaker mic with these, do not ever take it out. The spring contact in the jack will not go back into place, and it will not work right again. The material used in the spring contact is poor.<br /><br />I was quite dismayed to find that the output on UHF is a mere TWO WATTS out of the specified 4W -- and, yes, I used a meter appropriate for the frequency. VHF is actually slightly over 5W, and I bought it primarily for VHF simplex. Still, the diminished UHF capacity is a major reason to look at a Puxing, IMHO.<br /><br />As with the earlier models, there is no real squelch control. Sure, you can change the numbers for the squelch setting, but it does nothing.<br /><br />Long term, I'm concerned that Baofeng will stop making the LiOn batteries (or change the form factor), and the radio will be useless. These batteries wear out (permanently) faster than NiMH, and NiMH battery packs can be rebuilt at battery stores when they do go. LiOn cells can only handle so many charge cycles. Otherwise, look for the carbon pot in the volume control to get dirty and intermittent within two years. The longevity of the antenna jack is dubious, as well. These concerns are equally valid for Puxing units, too.",3,2

"I bought this product in June, and after 2 months of daily use here are some issues I have come across.   I have had to reset this item several times, at least every 3 days... The battery only lasts about 2 days... I cannot seem to load any documents onto the reader, no matter what I do.  This is my first ereader and I really like the fact I can read anywhere without taking a bunch of books with me, but I am saving up to get a better one.",3,1
"Let's be honest, I knew Boss was like Pyle, a &#34;pyle&#34; of garbage. The amp doesn't even push out half of the watts it says it does, the wiring kit is basically tooth floss, whenever I used wire strippers, all the copper came out too. The only good thing was the sub. I spend another $80 dollars at Best Buy to get a new wiring kit. After that, I was happy. It definitely adds a nice rumble in the truck. Enough to make to rear view mirror seem as if there is an earthquake. The only problem is sometimes it starts to smell cause the amp is a piece of ape poop, but for $180 it was worth it. The customer service was friendly, but I couldn't track the package, they also didn't tell me they sent two package. I'm happy with it though.",3,2
Decent camera...The camera has 7 Light emitting diodes (LED) on it to help with dark conditions (night vision). No where in the description does it mention 7&#34; or a 7 inch monitor or including a monitor for the camera. People are giving this a bad review because they can't read or misunderstand that LED on the label doesn't mean LED style monitor included. But a decent camera for the price.,3,2
"There aren't many choices when looking for a case/cover for the PRS-950.  The Sony brick and mortar stores don't even carry them.  *lame*  The ones on the Sony site are backordered *double lame*.  So I went shopping else where.    While this case comes with a screen protector, and a charger, I don't use either.  The front cover of the case protects the screen when in my bag, and while I'm using it, it seems unnecessary.  The charger thing didn't work for me.    That being said, I bought it for the case and not the other stuff.  The case does the job.  Its profile is small enough that it doesn't feel too bulky, which is important because the reader is uber-thin.  My only complaint about the case is minor, but it has to do with the orientation of the latching mechanism.  Rather than the closure being on the front, it's on the back, so you have to reach around to the back to open the latch.",3,1
"I've used this on my motorcycle for about a year now. I use a veho muvi hd camera on it. The unit is stable but sometimes a little wiggly. I suppose the weight at the end and wind tend to increase the pivot point more than if you are just holding the thing and moving it in your hands. Because it feels FIRM and not wiggly at all when it's not mounted or stressed. The length is ok, but wind pressure rocks it. I've used a tether to stabilize it somewhat.<br />The base ring is a tad bulky requiring me to bend it around somewhat to get in where it needs to be.<br /><br />That's just my experience. It's still together after about a year on the road. Depending on your use/camera weight I am sure the vibration could be less/more. I switched to a GoPro, so now I am researching higher quality mounts (aluminum). I just may come back to this one if I can figure out how to position it in the sweet spot on the handlebars and quell the vibration. Don't get me wrong, any type of extended mount will vibrate from wind at speed. This is not a flaw of the construction but mere physics. It's still unbroken after day to day thrashing for some time now.<br /><br />If I were to improve it, I would make the bending area a tad longer and use much stiffer materials to combat the vibration. The ball joint is ok. The screw part tended to unravel and loosen occasionally but overall held firm.",3,1

I haven't found a way yet to upload new games on it. Kinda boring games on the machine. I got pictures and music on it. Memory card very tiny.<br />Other than that nice display screen and works great. I don't know if I will be keeping it. Kinda disappointed in this mp3 mp4 player.,3,1
"At first I was very pleased with this product. The design was great and had all the right opening/moldings to fit the D3. However, after owning this case for only around 2 weeks and not bashing it around, I have noticed a rip in the silicon near where the USB connector port is and is working its way by the headphone jack. So as good as it looks, I have not had a pleasing experience with the durability of the product and may have to soon replace it.",3,1
I have used this for 3 or 4 months now with overall positive results. The footage is very sharp and high resolution. My issues arise with it in two areas: first is that it gets to be a little bit flaky in terms of the power connector where it hooks in. It likes to come out/ wiggle loose and turn off. Second the swivel lens at the front stopped holding an angle on day 5 and has had some tape on it since. Overall I would have to say that it's a cheap effective camera built cheaply. And you get what you pay for it'll do what you need for most things don't expect to use it in a really heavy duty situation. The operating system seems to be poorly designed as well lots of submenus and the documentation is not exactly correct with how the camera is set up.,3,1

"First let me say that I LOVE my Nook Color.  I ordered the car charger so that I could charge my Nook when I was on the road.  I haven't used it yet so I don't know how well it will work.  I decided that the black cover looked too masculine for me, but I will use it as a backup.  The LCD film was to protect the screen.  That I did use and I'm glad I did.  My screen is no longer showing smeared finger prints.  The film was not difficult to apply.  I followed some of the recommendations to go slowly and smooth the film carefully when I applied it.  Make sure you clean the screen thoroughly before applying.",3,1
"First, as many here have noted, be clear on what this speaker is best used for - laptops.  It requires USB power.  It does not use battery power.  You can use a USB wall adapter or car USB adapter and cord and a 3.5 mm audio cord and then use it with any audio device, and that's a plus, in my opinion.  Still, this was really intended for use with windows laptops (must support plug-n-play drivers).  And for that purpose, this is a fine speaker.<br /><br />It is very ruggedly built with a strong aluminum case and grill, has basic controls (on/off, volume up/down), a 3.5 mm audio input, and a USB power input.  It is easy to grab and carry as the rear/top rim makes a good handle.  The sound quality is good for personal listening.  Bass rolls off around 200 mHz (I'm guessing), but is good enough for general music, games, movies, and so forth.  The mids are good and the highs sufficient.  It's plenty loud for personal use.<br /><br />I have and use a lot of SimplyVibe products and, in general, like them very much.  This one is very well designed and made, but has a much more limited feature set than some of the other models.  It does have the resonator design that produces a little fuller sound than some of the smaller models, but does not have the FM radio, SD card or microSD card slots, nor the great rechargable battery used in the other models.<br /><br />Still, if what you need is a speaker to plug into your laptop (using just the USB cord), it's great for that purpose.",3,1

"UPDATE AS OF 9/6/13 (3 STARS)<br /><br />I wanted to give a quick update regarding this product.  The iPhone 5 has been out for almost a year and they STILL have not been able to give me an update or upgrade to this stereo.  I gave up.  I even left it with my old car because I figured it would be worthless.  Now that the iPhone 5s/c is supposed to be coming out, I doubt they will be trying to be make any changes to this product.  If you still have an iPhone 3-4s, this might work for you.  Emails and Twitter updates confirm that they're \\""STILL\\"" working on getting an update.  Some of us can't wait.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW (4 STARS)<br /><br />So, I purchased this stereo after two disappointments with previous stereos.  My first stereo was a Chinese product I purchased for $300 that broke within a year of its purchase.  My second stereo was an iPhone compatible stereo I pre-paid for with a false promise of Summer delivery that didn't come through.  I cancelled that order and decided to purchase this iRoc - iPhone Car Stereo and so far I pretty much love it!  One of my biggest concerns was the possibility of upgrading to an iPhone 5 and issues with the change in the dock connector.  I e-mailed iRoc and they said they would have a fix for that within 5 weeks for any and all customers if needed.  To me, that's great customer service!<br /><br />Installation was a breeze, but that's probably because I go through car stereos like Imelda Marcos goes through shoes.  I have a Mazda 3 and found a perfect dash kit that made the iRoc look like stock with no gaps.  The blue lights on the iRoc match well with my interior.  The sound output to the speakers is great, and the visual equalizer is awesome.  It doesn't seem to save my settings though, but I just keep the program running in the background.  I haven't tested the video output, but when I do, I'll post another review.  The simplicity of the design is something that should be imitated across the board when it comes to carstereos.  It is definitely a beautiful product.<br /><br />One of the greatest things about the iRoc is the integration you have for hands free and the included mic.  I was able to run the mic cable under the dash, through a side panel and mount it right above me.  Some friends say that there is a bit of an echo when I call, but otherwise they can hear me fine.  Siri responds perfectly with all aspects of her voice recognition including text messaging.  The coolest part is that I purchased a really cheap SWI-PS from eBay and was able to get my steering wheel controls to work with it.  I can pause the music and mute, skip tracks, rewind and go forward.  I really wish there was Siri steering wheel integration, but it's not that hard for me to hit the home button and hold it for Siri to respond.<br /><br />I only have two minor issues which may have changed my mind in purchasing the product if I weren't so desperate for a new car stereo.  My first issue is the fact that there is no ability to use a regular car stereo tuner to get local stations.  There isn't even an input for the stereo antenna in your car.  It shouldn't be that hard to develop an app to emulate a stereo tuner.  Additionally, iHeart Radio and TuneIn Radio DO NOT WORK PROPERLY in my area and almost never play the stations as I request them to.  I'm in the tech capital of the world (Silicon Valley) so you wouldn't expect that to be a problem.  Also, for those without unlimited internet plans, who cares if you have iHeart Radio and TuneIn on a long road trip?  My only other beef is not with the iRoc itself as much as it is with the iPhone.  iRoc is supposed to be an official developer for Apple, so why is it that they didn't collaborate to either make it it possible to use the iPhone in landscape mode while connected OR in the alternative, iRoc should have an app that can run specific music / navigation programs in landscape mode?  It's almost impossible to try and open up navigation to follow directions,however I know that should be fixed with iOS 6.  The alternative would be jailbreaking, but I'm not a huge fan of that.  And FORGET about trying to go through music in album mode.  If your song is not associated with an album, it will not show up in your list of songs, not even under \\""unknown\\"".  Luckily, Siri will play just about anything you tell her to play and with the mic she will recognize your voice and what you're trying to ask her to do perfectly.<br /><br />Other than that, I think this is a pretty good product and that with the changes in the iOS and possibility of jailbreaking it would get a total 5 out of 5 stars.",3,1

"I feel it takes away from the screen quality. Doesnt hurt the touch sensitivity at all, and I got it on flawlessly on my first try. If screen quality doesn't mean much to you (which I doubt is the case since the whole reason most ppl bought the Cowon S9 was for its beautiful AMOLED screen), I say go for it. Its also a fingerprint magnet, but it comes with a screen cleaner that works very well. Overall, it accomplishes its primary function (protecting the screen) nicely.    Lexerd makes great protective screens in general though. I have one on my HTC Droid Incredible (Also sports an AMOLED screen) and it didnt affect the screen quality at all.",3,1
The lights and switch back work great they break very easy tho and the adhesive leaves a nasty residue on your light. A little elbow grease gets it off tho. Great price for a mock up or temporary fit to see if you like it. Make sure you cut them perfectly with a thin blade or they don't work.,3,1

"Update 3-28-15:<br />I have owned this battery pack for two years. I have finally decided to update my original review declaring my unhappiness with its performance. For starters, the connection junction between the built-in cable and plug connector on both the USB plug and Micro USB plug have &#34;broken down&#34; causing internal wiring exposure. Its still usable, but concerning. In addition, the battery performance is no longer adequate for a 7000mAh battery pack. My ability to charge my mobile device successively has diminished greatly.<br /><br />I searched far and wide for an external battery charger that would suit my needs. I looked at many other brands on amazon.com and finally decided on the New Trent NT70T Easypak. The main selling point for me was built in micro usb and usb charging cables. What a great feature! So far the battery pack has been working flawlessly. I'm able to charge my Motorola Droid 4 without any issues. I'm amazed how fast the Easypak charges my mobile phone. The Easypak is a sleek looking device too. I really like the outer shell design. If I had to nitpick about anything, I would say the built in micro usb connector takes some good effort and control to push into and pull out of the Droid 4 micro usb connection port. Other than that, I'm very happy with my purchase.",3,1

"This is a good case but it has a few flaws.  The main one is that you have to take it off to remove the connector cable.  It is somewhat bulky and the belt clip was way too bulky, loose and awkward.

If you were looking for a case that does its job, then this would be a case for you, but if you were looking for a fancy case this one isn't the one for you.",3,1

"I purchased this to charge my iPhone at work so that I could leave the charger that came with the phone at home.  It works very well, charging the phone in the same time as the Apple charger.  The only issue is that the electrical safety inspector at work (a hospital) will not permit me to use this charger because it is not certified electrically safe by any standards association (UL, CSA, CE, etc.)  As a result, I must use the Apple charger at work and use this product at home.  While it does not seem dangerous or overheat, I wonder if there really is a difference between the products.  They look identical, with the exception of the markings (or lack thereof).

"I purchased the IG-A05 dashboard vent mount for my Garmin nuvi GPS so I could move it between my cars and rental cars when I travel.  The design is ingenious.  The two clips slide in a slot to vary their spacing.  Each clip rotates so it can grab a vent louver at any angle from horizontal to vertical.  A kick-stand type hinged leg supports the mount from below.  Loosen the collar and you can adjust the angle of the shaft holding the pivot ball for the GPS bracket.  Unfortunately, it appears that it cannot accommodate all varieties of dashboard vents.    The thin plastic vent louvers in my Lexus have a streamlined cross section, thicker at the pivot than at the edges.  The saw-toothed clips grab the louver, and I found a good place to rest the supporting leg.  Even so, it eventually shook loose during a sedate drive in my Lexus with the GPS attached.    My classic Corvette has a metal-ball side vent with thick straight metal louvers.  The mount clips grab the louver tightly and the leg rests in the crease between the dash and the ball.  The mount prevailed through a bumpy and sporty test drive with my GPS in the Corvette.    I had hoped to take the mount on trips for use in rental cars to avoid the scarce availability and inflated charges for GPS.  I am skeptical that I can get the mount to work in a unknown car.",3,1

"As a buyer of well-over 300 Baofeng radios (and counting) for the group I belong to (not all of which were purchased through Amazon but many were), I'm always amazed at the lengths some sellers go to to hype their products as being \\""newer\\"" or \\""better\\"" than other models, or perhaps (to give them the benefit of the doubt) they just don't know any better.<br /><br />First, the Baofeng UV-5R series (including the original and still extremely popular UV-5R, I'll explain why in a minute) is what is normally referred to by many as a SDR radio (or software defined radio).  While not a true SDR product (you can't use it with your computer to control the radio's functions or scan a wide amount of VHF/UHF frequencies with it), none the less a large chip is programmed on the circuit board built inside each radio.  That chip determines what capability the radio itself can perform.<br /><br />Every UV-5R series radio has the ability to transmit from 136-174 MHz on VHF and from 400-520 MHz on UHF in both narrow-band and wide-band modes (very useful for the occasional FRS or MURS use, which requires narrow-band mode to work correctly).<br /><br />Every model does \\""at least\\"" 4W on VHF/UHF from the factory, but occasionally you'll get a batch that does 4.5W or even 5W out, but the difference between 4W and 5W is minimal at best.  A 4W radio with a better antenna will easily outperform a 5W radio with the standard crappy antenna that Baofeng ships on ALL (including the UV-5RA, -5RAX, and -5RAX+) models.<br /><br />Baofeng DOES NOT program those chips any differently for the UV-5R vs. any other UV-5R series (including the UV-5RA).  Version 307 of the firmware (which is the most current release I have in any of my radios) works EXACTLY the same way as previous older releases of firmware at least back to the 295 release (over a year ago), so any claim from a seller that this release provides additional features (at least from a user's perspective) is simply BOGUS, since the firmware inside both radios have the same features.  In fact, my UV-5R radios with the 307 firmware release is EXACTLY the same radio (inside and within the firmware) as my UV-5RA radios with the 307 firmware release.<br /><br />Second, you CANNOT in any way upgrade the firmware (unless you count buying a different radio and it comes with a different firmware release), so again the claim in the listing from some sellers that you can is simply BOGUS.<br /><br />Third, you can believe that two thinner pieces (glued or screwed together on the faceplate of the UV-5RA) is somehow stronger than one thicker piece of plastic (on the original UV-5R series) if you like (and maybe it is), but I haven't seen that in real-world use from my own UV-5RA units.  The standard UV-5R units that we use seem to hold up just as well (when dropped in the desert dirt or rolling down a hill) as any other Baofeng radio we own and use.<br /><br />Fourth, and my biggest issue with all of the non-standard UV-5RA, UV-5RAX and UV-5RAX+ units, is that NONE of the Baofeng battery accessories (except the little 1800 mAh standard battery) work WITHOUT modification (unless you use a Dremel tool to grind or cut off part of your extended battery that works on the standard UV-5R - but won't work on your UV-5RA, UV-5RAX or UV-5RAX+).<br /><br />Getting new UV-5RA units that don't work with Extended 3800 mAh batteries (without modification) doesn't make my group happy.  That may not bother you, but NONE of the sellers of the non-standard UV-5RA, UV-5RAX, and UV-5RAX+ units ever seem to mention that lack of hardware compatibility in their listings, so buyer beware!<br /><br />BTW, NONE of the \\""AA\\"" or \\""AAA\\"" battery shell packs work on the UV-5RA, UV-5RAX, or UV-5RAX+ units either, so that's 3 different battery accessories (including the 3800 mAh extended battery) that you can't use on these radios without hacking them with a Dremel tool (but they all work without modification on the original UV-5R units).<br /><br />So \\""if\\"" you want a \\""pretty\\"" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (or -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.  Oh, you should see how well that shiny faceplate lights up when a flashlight hits it in the dark, just the thing you don't want for night use.<br /><br />Virtually every guy in our group ends up carrying a standard UV-5R and giving the UV-5RA, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ to the wife or kids, since the wife and/or kids rarely care about the other accessories working and they (the wife and kids) tend to like the \\""pretty\\"" radios, but again there is NO INTERNAL difference and NO EXTRA FEATURES in the UV-5RA, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ units (other than a different looking shiny faceplate) vs. the original and still wildly popular UV-5R (which I refer to as the M16 of radios, as all the accessories you match it up with just plain work).<br /><br />Now you know the real background on these radios.f\\"" you want a \\""pretty\\"" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (or -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.

"I have used several of this type of MP3 player with FM transmitter. This one is like most except it is still working after 2 weeks.  The sound quality is OK, not real good. The volume is too low and I would prefer a on/off control which it doesn't have. All in all I am getting what I paid for.",3,2
"Had to cut down to fit the screen, is definitely a matte finish. I think I may have screwed it up while applying it. Cleaned my screen, worked in a clean area, still got bubbles and &#34;stuff&#34; under it. Will take my electronics in and let the guys at the shop do it, they did the first one real nice.",3,1
Excellent product but it does not fit Honda CBR 250R as in the description,3,1
"I don't really know what happened, but other buyers said there is a swiveling belt clip on this case which is what I needed; My results are a bit different. I guess I just got that one puch that didnt get it. I you need the rotating belt clip, its best not to rely on this product.     It is however great for travel, or school.",3,1
"This system had a hard time just finding simple directions, my Motorola Droid does a much better job and costs nothing. Not impressed, at all.",3,1
"I got this speaker system to attach to my Kindle so I can hear it louder when I clean the house. I like all the features. The SD card reader, the USB, AUX in and out, and rechargeable battery. The only thing that I think needs to be stronger is the volume level. I had another similar speaker system that I gave to my mother because I was getting this new one but the other speaker system was much louder. Depdending on the music player or input your attach, when you get to its loudest the sound quality diminishes. If the speaker is right next to you then it is a decent solution but if you have to move around and there is other noises like cars outside or kids, then read the reviews on level of volume for this product and other products.",3,1
"Well I just got the unit. I'm almost surprised that it works at all for such a low price for what it is advertised to do. My first big hurdle will be to decipher the menus as they are all in Chinese. No manual was included so this will be a big guessing game. Hmmm, do I press button one while holding button two, or just push button one for 3.35 seconds. LOL :)",3,1
"Amazon made good by offering a full refund for the cable that was sent to me incorrectly. I specifically ordered the extra long 3m lighting cable but instead received the 1m cable.

Ok,3,1
This isn't a soft - nice to touch coat.<br />No esperes la textura del silicone,3,1
im upset because it comes with no instructions on how to work it so i havent been able to use it  do i need a card to down load music or what because i tried to down load my computer said it syc the music to the play but it didnt have any music when i went to listen to it and no phone number in how to send it back or ask questions about the product,3,2
"No frills line-out from your iPod to whatever source you choose. It seems decently built, but I definitely baby it. It feels a bit stiff which causes me to worry about build quality but so far it's held up for 7 months. For $10 I'm happy so far.",3,1
"This obviously isn't the most high-end arm band available, but I was looking for something inexpensive and this fit the bill. The silicone covering fits fine and I haven't had trouble working the click wheel or accessing the toggle hold switch while it's on. My only gripe is that the stitching on the arm band was already unraveling a bit when I took it out of the package. It works okay now, but I'm not sure how long it will last before the velcro completely peels away from the elastic. Otherwise, it's fine - the arm band is relatively comfortable to wear while running and easy to adjust.",3,1
"I really liked this product at first.  It's easy to slip on and off, and I can even stash a few dollar bills in the back to keep on me incase my blood sugar crashes mid-run and I need to stop and get something.  However, after using this product since May, the clip broke off.  I guess I can't complain too much, considering how cheap it was, but it is still disappointing.",3,2
"Pros:   It comes with a set of ear buds and a head phone splitter so two people can listen at once.    It comes with a silicone case and an armband.    You also get an extra USB cable and a little mesh bag you can hold extra accessories in.    Cons:  I went to use the wall charger and now I CANNOT get the USB plug out of the adapter. I was using the USB cable supplied with my 3rd Gen iPod Touch. I ended up having to SAND the USB end and flour up my fingers and hand to be able to get it out.    The hard plastic case and the leather case both have non-removable belt clips.     The leather case has magnets in it.    The retractable cable doesn't roll back in that easily or well.    Other thoughts:  It comes with a car charger, screen protector, and a cable I believe is used to hook into your car's audio system. I cannot grade these as I have not used them yet.",3,1
"I was excited getting the product and had fun playing around seeing what objects gave it the best quality of sound . But, when it comes to actually using it there are some issues.<br /><br />Pros: rechargeable battery , compact size , very innovative<br /><br />Cons: not suited for travel well , meaning the sticky pads yes if you wash them they will last a little  but it's a pain to clean especially in a work environment ,if you buy this product make sure you buy plenty of sticky pads and have extras in your pocket.",3,1
"Ive had this unit for almost a year now in my 2008 nissan altima. Bluetooth is great but as soon as you step out of the car with your phone in your pocket as i have had to do several times with the car and stereo turned on, the audio cuts out a lot. ive had a decent sony bluetooth stereo that i could walk almost a block away and the music is fine. when i had to get something out of my truck, that was the worst. so i just left my phone in my car. Like i said before, this unit is made mostly for an iphone which is really dispointing considering i am a loyal Samsung Galaxy user. There is a sony unit with mirrorlink for smartphones that im really considering on getting, its called the Soney XAV-701BT and it looks amazing<br />HD radio isn't bad to the preset stations you have, its nice knowing what station and what the song name is, sometimes it even brings up album artwork. My rearview camera is not bad with it either along with the external microhone it also comes with that i have on my sun visor. Overal, great stereo but did not need to pay the $500 for it unless i had an iphone and even then, maybe i would have gotten this stereo",3,1
"As a buyer of well-over 300 Baofeng radios (and counting) for the group I belong to (not all of which were purchased through Amazon but many were), I'm always amazed at the lengths some sellers go to to hype their products as being \\""newer\\"" or \\""better\\"" than other models, or perhaps (to give them the benefit of the doubt) they just don't know any better.<br /><br />First, the Baofeng UV-5R series (including the original and still extremely popular UV-5R, I'll explain why in a minute) is what is normally referred to by many as a SDR radio (or software defined radio).  While not a true SDR product (you can't use it with your computer to control the radio's functions or scan a wide amount of VHF/UHF frequencies with it), none the less a large chip is programmed on the circuit board built inside each radio.  That chip determines what capability the radio itself can perform.<br /><br />Every UV-5R series radio has the ability to transmit from 136-174 MHz on VHF and from 400-520 MHz on UHF in both narrow-band and wide-band modes (very useful for the occasional FRS or MURS use, which requires narrow-band mode to work correctly).<br /><br />Every model does \\""at least\\"" 4W on VHF/UHF from the factory, but occasionally you'll get a batch that does 4.5W or even 5W out, but the difference between 4W and 5W is minimal at best.  A 4W radio with a better antenna will easily outperform a 5W radio with the standard crappy antenna that Baofeng ships on ALL (including the UV-5RA, -5RA+, -5RAX, and -5RAX+) models.<br /><br />Baofeng DOES NOT program those chips any differently for the UV-5R vs. any other UV-5R series (including the UV-5RA+).  Version 307 of the firmware (which is the most current release I have in any of my radios) works EXACTLY the same way as previous older releases of firmware at least back to the 295 release (over a year ago), so any claim from a seller that this release provides additional features (at least from a user's perspective) is simply BOGUS, since the firmware inside both radios have the same features.  In fact, my UV-5R radios with the 307 firmware release is EXACTLY the same radio (inside and within the firmware) as my UV-5RA+ radios with the 307 firmware release.<br /><br />Second, you CANNOT in any way upgrade the firmware (unless you count buying a different radio and it comes with a different firmware release), so again the claim in the listing (from some sellers) that you can is simply BOGUS.<br /><br />Third, you can believe that two thinner pieces (glued or screwed together on the faceplate of the UV-5RA+) is somehow stronger than one thicker piece of plastic (on the original UV-5R series) if you like (and maybe it is), but I haven't seen that in real-world use from my own UV-5RA+ units.  The standard UV-5R units that we use seem to hold up just as well (when dropped in the desert dirt or rolling down a hill) as any other Baofeng radio we own and use.<br /><br />Fourth, and my biggest issue with all of the non-standard UV-5RA, UV-5RA+, UV-5RAX and UV-5RAX+ units, is that NONE of the Baofeng battery accessories (except the little 1800 mAh standard battery) work WITHOUT modification (unless you use a Dremel tool to grind or cut off part of your extended battery that works on the standard UV-5R - but won't work on your UV-5RA, UV-5RA+, UV-5RAX or UV-5RAX+).<br /><br />Getting new UV-5RA+ units that don't work with Extended 3800 mAh batteries (without modification) doesn't make my group happy.

"This is a great case for a device that can be tough to find cases for.  The screen protector though I never got the chance to use; the moment I removed the protective backing on it it statically attracted some microfibers right out of the air which caused bubbling on the screen.  An attempt to rectify this resulted in frustration and the effective destruction of the protector.  If I could review the case itself it'd get 5/5, but the protector product and installation experience leaves something to be desired.",3,2

"This combo installed easy.  I installed on a Suburban with no difficulty and there was actually wiring to spare.  From opening box to driving away was just a couple of hours max.  My only negative is that the screen will occasionally come on by itself when starting the car in the Aux input video mode.  It is simple to turn it off again, but it is an annoyance.  I do wish it was a wider view than the 135 degree stated, but that is fairly accurate.<br /><br />Update after 6 months: The camera quit working after about 6 months.  First it would flicker between blank screen and the camera, now the camera is just blank screen.  I replaced it with the TT-CC22.  It is metal and has the 170 degree view that I really needed anyway.  I am happy to say the monitor is still working fine except for the annoyance mentioned in my original review.

"I purchased a total of 6 (4 on their own, and 2 with power adapters) of these so I wouldn't have to carry one cable with me everywhere I went. When I got them they were all in plastic bag packages with MOBI in a black header at the top. At first I tried to use one to do a sync on my iPhone 3Gs but it errored out. After that I decided to test all the cables for data transfer ability. I used SharePod to transfer 1.8Gb of music(3 audio books) from my pc to my phone. First I did it with the Apple OEM Cable that came with my phone. It transfered all the files in 4min 12sec (SharePod shows how long it took). Then I tested each of the cables. Of the 6 only 1 was actually able to do the file transfer, the other 5 couldn't even transfer one of the files to my phone. They all gave the same error (Sorry I don't remember exactly what it was). However all these cables do seem to work for USB charging. I have noticed that occasionally they do disconnect and immediately reconnect.    In short they are fine for USB charing, but I wouldn't use them for data transfer.",3,2

Seems my G3 Garmin (which I love) is a bit thick for this device.  I added a 1&#34; strip of Velcro to the back so I won't lose it.  Its a handy device for my cart.,3,1
"It plays music off the USB ports just fine, but I can't get it to play songs properly off an SD card directly.  When playing off the SD port, it plays only the first 1 ~ 2 seconds of each song before skipping to the next. If I take the same SD card and put it in an USB card reader connected to this player's USB port, then the songs play correctly. The COPY function copies only one file - the one you are currently stopped on. You can copy from any of the ports to any other port - the 1st device to be plugged in is always the source, the 2nd is the target (the screen shows the copy direction, but you can't change that). FM transmission is ok - the sound quality is similar to that of a good AM-radio station. The trick seems to be to find 3 unused frequencies that are right next to each other (or a weak station sandwiched between two unused ones) and set the transmitter to the one in the middle. There is an headphone jack but no audio input jack, so you cannot use this as just an FM transmitter for another audio source (eg. your old standalone MP3 player). It has the usual play-all/repeat-one/shuffle-play options. You can skip to the previous / next song, but there is no fast-forward / reverse within the same track. It remembers the track it was playing when power is shut off, and will automatically restart at the beginning of that track when power is restored. The display shows the track number and the selected FM frequency, but has no other information about the song you are playing.",3,2
"I bought these gloves last night at a local electronics megastore.  Because of the way the gloves were merchandised, stuck to a piece of card stock with a series of three nylon tabs, I couldn't actually put them on and test them with my phone so I just bought them, confident that they would function similarly to the other four pair of touchscreen gloves I have bought over the last few years.  This confidence was rooted in the fact that each of the other four pair I had bought worked as well the others or, in other words, I had not noticed any fluctuation in their effectiveness- every pair worked well aside from the reality that it won't ever be as easy to use a touchscreen device wearing gloves as it is using your bare hands!  When I did try them I must admit to being disappointed in the degree to which they effectively worked on a touchscreen device.   I had practically decided to throw them away when, as I removed my finger from the screen, for the slightest second something seemed to happen on the screen- I had moved the image on the screen very, very slightly.  What was this?  Is there some trick to using them? Assuming that there must be, I began to fondle my screen in every conceivable way.....using the knuckle of the finger, the tip of the finger, the side of the finger,the Palm, the back of the hand, the top of the finger along the seam of the glove,...Eureka! Some more movement on the screen.  So I repeated this tip-of-the-finger-along-the-seam-while-pressing-very-hard action and voila! More movement.  So, I used this technique to try to write a text....on the third attempt I got a letter, but it was the wrong letter.  Backspace but got a RETURN button.  Rinse and repeat, ad nauseum.  By the time I got a whole word spelled correctly, my fingers were literally sore from pushing so hard and my skin was getting irritated from having to work along the seam of the glove where, evidently, the few capacitive threads are buried.  Because different technology is employed from one device to another to create the touch screen technology, I decided to try more than one device to make sure that the problem wasn't an anomaly. So I tried on my iPhone, on my iPad,and all my Microsoft surface Pro 3. I got the best results on the iPad.  The most positive thing about these gloves is that I only paid about a fourth of the cost for which they are listed here on Amazon, but as my grandfather used to say, 25% of nothing is still nothing. it wouldn't be fair to say that they doNt work, but I can say that they don't work well. If I had to do it all over again I would probably get the iGloves brand, as they seem to work the best, but I can also recommend Northface and Isotoner capacitive gloves.  All three of those manufacturers' products worked great and only differed in terms of style and thickness.e.",3,2
"It can read the modules in our RX-350, but it can't write to them, or open the menu needed for custom settings. So - it's OK, but I'll be looking for something better.

I love my portable speakers! I use them mostly with my laptop. The sound is so amazing for such a small speaker! My co-worker fell in love with it too and she purchased a set right away after she tested mine out. Getting ready to order my son a set because he already started borrowing mine!,3,1

You have to press a little more purposefully, but it's no biggie.<br />Two days after applying the case, it popped open at the sides.

Still an alright case, though.",3,2

They would problably s-l-o-w-l-y charge it overnight, if the NookColor were turned off, or in standby with WiFi off, but they are not strong enough to keep it from discharging while in use.  They are just standard 700 ma USB power supplies.",3,1

"I ordered this cover last night i live in LA Hollywood and i had it on 2-3 day slandered shipment but it only took one day witch is great :)    Pros: the back cover is absolutely perfect and looks great.    Cons: the Front cover has a big defect that anyone with a sharp eye will pick it up right away, its not as dark as it looks like in the pic its more of a gray color to it. Also you cant take it off after you put it on because its made so you put it on and \\""leave it on\\"". The material feels a bit cheap on the inside but the outside is \\""Rubberized\\"" as they advertised and it still feels a bit cheap.    So over all it looks great but there are way better ones out there if you can over look the fact that it will have some visible defects and that you cant take it off after putting it on than by all means get it.",3,1
The only reason I gave it 3 starts is because there is no opening for one of the controls.  Otherwise it is fabulous for the money and the 11 year old loves it!,3,1
I have had tests that say I need high frequency amplification. For the price this does what you advertise. I would buy an amplifier like the one I lost from Radio Shack that had a treble control. Unfortunately that was years ago and it only cost about $20.

"It sounds pretty good, but according to the instructions the battery is fully charged when the red light turns off, so far I can't tell if my battery is ever charged because when I connect the charger the red light never turns off even if I leave it connected around the clock, trust me I left it connected for more 24 hours and still the red light remains solid.",3,1
"It looks okay. Did not use it as of yet, because you did not include the Wideband Oxygen Sensor with it. If you would<br />send me one with the instructions, I will be happy to install and test it.<br />Thanks.",3,1
I needed a two knobber to fit my dash but didn't want to pay a lot for it. The tuner kind of gets stations if the signal is strong but the dial isn't accurate so you have to hunt down your station. The SD/usb option works fine but there is no display so you either just listen in order or hunt and peck for tracks. Over all its probably priced fairly but next time I would pay a little more for a better unit.,3,1
"This is an OK item if you're looking to install an aftermarket single din stereo in your truck. I purchased this for a 89 chevy c2500 that I've been modifying to make my little \\""road runner\\"" truck. it holds radios good, though it's a pain in the ass to put the radio in with the center metal piece. $26.44 is not worth it for this item as it is made with mostly plastic, and does not contain the air vents. Though it makes the stereo look left in the pictures it's actually centered. Overall 3/5 stars due to price.",3,1
"My previous unit had a great sound but one day I could no longer get it to play. Tryed everything the manual said with no luck. Researched and found this unit made by the same manufacture only it wasn't the same. Appearance and functions all the same except for the sound. Nowhere near like the one I had. At max volume, tremendous distortion. After carefull examination, I noticed the speaker was assemblied backwards. Instead of convex, it was concaved. My original one was convexed. Thus the distortion. This should have been caught at Q.C. inspection. Return for replacement would have to come from (you guessed it) China. Not worth sending back. Live and learn.",3,2
well it works great except the battery wont hold a charge gonna see how to get a different onr or something,3,1
"Item does work.  It's easy enough to use.   The ability to charge it in the car, is a nice feature.  Has some trouble maintaining range.  For some reason worked better in one car versus another.  The biggest drawback is it's limited frequency and range.  OK product for the price.",3,1
"I guess I got what I paid for. Mostly treble, no bass. The thing looks really nice tho. I just leave it on my bathroom shelf. Wouldn't buy another one.",3,1
"The bracket does not hold the Garmin Oregon 400t as advertised. The Side arms do not retract narrow enough to hold the devise. If you turn the bracket 90 degrees, the side arms will contact the devise, but will not hold it securely enough. I called the manufacturer, and told them it would not hold the Oregon and they said they would send me another one. It was the same bracket which does not hold the GPS. I finally fabricated a piece and took off the side arms and so far it will hold the Oregon 400t. Do not buy this if you are expecting it to hold a Colorado or Oregon GPS from Garmin.",3,2
"I decided to buy this as an upgrade to HBF-306C which, in my opinion, is a piece of trash. I have to say that this scale is pretty consistent, but is a little off. I know for a fact that I am 17%BF, but this scale insists that I am in the 22% range. The only reason I did not give it less stars is because, even thou I'm sure of my BF composition, there is a little chance I am wrong.",3,1
"Okay, here's the good:  You can't beat the price, right?  My daughter's original cord for her ipod wore out so I purchased two of these.  The bad, it did not work in her ipod (I see in the description it says \\""iPhone\\"" but the original cord that came with my iphone worked to charge both my phone and the ipod.  The ugly, though the cable does work to charge my iphone, it only actually charges when it is connected to my laptop (not the power adapter/outlet).  That can be a pain in the butt but oh well.",3,2
the images of the band are not clear and concise.  there is a blur and that takes away from the color and distinct figures,3,2
"I read a lot of reviews before buying this product and many stated having to un-pair and pair every time they wanted to use it.  I have not had this problem although it can be very slow to connect.  I found after turning the adapter on, it can take up to 2 minutes to connect to my phone (LG G2).  During that time, if I look at the connection on the phone and try to force the connection from there, that rarely works and may even conflict with the adapter's attempts to connect (one time it took 20 minutes to connect trying it that way)<br />Also, the power button must be held for about 8 seconds to power it on, not 3 seconds as instructed in the 1 page instruction sheet.<br /><br />I have found that once connected, the sound is not bad for the mids and highs but the low end response is not very good (as compared to the $10 wired cassette adapter I was using)<br /><br />The battery life is pretty good; it lasts about 1 week when using it 2 times each day for about 20-30 minutes each time.<br /><br />I would recommend this product for those that are in the car for longer periods of time; the reconnect issue would be painful for those who are in and out of the car frequently.  If the reconnect issue could be addressed so it worked as quickly and consistently as a standard bluetooth headset, I would have rated this at 4 stars.  If it also had better bass response I would have given it 5 stars.",3,2

"I love screen protectors and have one of most of my electronics.  This one works just like the others and it really isn't that difficult to put on.  I misaligned it at first but was able to pull it back off (I hadn't applied it all the way) and realign it perfectly.  A few days later I dropped my keys on the screen of my Kindle and the screen protector sustained a small scratch.  Would that have happened to the actualy screen had there not been a protector on it?  I can't say, but it isn't something I want to chance.  The only downside is that it creates a glare, which is one thing the Kindle is big on... no glare!",3,1
Product was received in timely fashion.  I like the padded protection for the iPod.  I have to turn the iPod upside down to access the head-phone jack.  Arm band a little short for my liking.  Overall good product for the price.,3,1
It's okay. Price was right however. Protects my Nook Reader just fine.,3,1
Lost the lottery works when it wants to.,3,1
"When I first received the item in the mail, I was in love with the look, yet worried about how thin it looked. I put the case on, which was easy. The case looked great, and I got many compliments. I could fit the charger in and headphones with no problem. Then 3 weeks later, I dropped my ipod from only about a foot off the ground and the side of the case fell off. I tried to super glue it but there is no hope. ALl I have to say is, this case is great till you drop it, which is inevitable.",3,1
"At first wasn't able to make the screen work. There was no blue screen if it was not connected with cam and when connected still nothing. There is no manual, just a small paper that explains more how to connect a cam then how to connect to car or operate the 3 buttons the device as. I contacted with the supplier to see if he solves my problem. But while waiting for a response I tried once more and it worked. There is still no blue screen, only black. I think it's better the black screen. But both video inputs work, and image as good quality. I had a fast response from costumer service and they tried to help and where available to change the product. Since it is working there is no need. But it's good to know that if needed I could count on them.",3,2

"If you live in the South, leave this on your windshield, expect it to last about a year.  The mount is black, gets very hot in the sun.  Depending on the car, it can warp or actually melt.   The suction cup gets brittle and won't stick after a while.  So far, I have not found any windshield mount that lasts more than a year or 2 in the Texas heat.  It's best to remove it each time you leave your vehicle, although that is a pain.",3,1
"These HDD enclosures are built cheaply in China, and sold at a nice profit by greedy resellers.  Micca Store twice offered no help to offer to resend a new car charger (mail said it was delivered, I never signed for it).      Now the unit has stopped working after 4 months and it does not have a warranty, only 30 days.  So...my opinion to buy something more expensive and more sturdy is reinforced again.    Settle for this if you want a short term solution and if you wish to have prompt...but bad customer service.",3,2

They do cling to the Kindle, fit fine and easy to read through.",3,2
"Looks are deceiving.  I specifically bought this cable because it was 'Apple Approved.'.  It also looks much sturdier than the Apple cable - in short, it LOOKS as if it is built to last.  My old cable that originally came with my iPad was beginning to fray.  It still works, but I didn't like the idea of using a cable where I could see the wires and had to use electrical tape to hold it.  This cable from RND didn't work more than a month and a half.  For a short while, it worked intermittently, and then not at all.  My original Apple cable with electrical tape holding it still works.  I think I would have been better off purchasing one of the cut rate deals that may or may not work or just biting the bullet and getting a new one from Apple.<br /><br />Update: 7/3/2012<br /><br />In response to the commenter who  commented on RND backing up their products - I felt like a lot of time had passed, so I didn't contact the company regarding this issue.  But - I did decide to give RND another chance.  After all, if a company backs up their products then the failure rate should be low.  Three months later, I am looking at another failed cable.  This time, I will contact the company, and see what they have to say.  But, I have to say - once is an \\""accident\\""; twice and in my opinion, a pattern is beginning to form.<br /><br />Update: 7/4/2012<br /><br />I sent RND an email yesterday and they swear that their products are made to last.  Could it be that I'm yanking the cords out, they query?  No, I say.  Actually, the cords have actually slipped out at times.  Anyway, they have promised to send out replacements.  Considering that they'll send a replacement, I'll increase the rating by a star for now.  We'll see how the replacement does.",3,2
No Rating.  I did not need to use it.,3,2

"Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a \\""perfect\\"" case out there yet ([...]) for the 5-inch GPS screens, so I settled for this one. (I use this for my Garmin Nuvi 1490LMT 5-inch...)    -Holds the unit nicely  -If I jam things in right, it will hold the power cable too  -No way the sucker cup and mount will fit inside  -The little exterior carabiner clip is cheapo plasicky (don't plan on attaching it to the outside of your luggage and it making it to your destination)  -Shipping took SEVEN DAYS from the seller bestpricecenter (guess amazon prime shipping has spoiled me)    Also, if you just stumbled across this, note that this shell is available in many colors and a few fabric/material coverings.    One other weird thing to know - When you first get it the toxic plastic smell will knock you out. I'm no sissy, but just holding it for about 3 minutes after opening literally gave me a headache, and my wife smelled it from the other room. (Think new car smell times a million.) I actually had to leave it outside for a few days just to air it out. I saw other reviews commenting about this and just dismissed it as some oversensitive person being picky, but be prepared. You will not want to leave it inside your house for the first couple of days.    Would I buy it again? Yes (But only until something better comes along.)",3,2
One of the amplifiers didn't work.,3,2
"I have purchased at least four of these within the past year.  None has lasted longer than two or three months before it simply stops working.  However, it works really well when it does work.

Would love it if the manufacturer would make this extender more durable.",3,1
"THIS IS SOLD UNDER MANY DIFFERENT NAMES. This exact module is sold by many different companies who give it different names.<br />The prices can vary from $16 to $30.<br /><br />THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO DO THIS THAT WILL GIVE YOU BETTER SOUND. If you already have a good quality cassette deck or a portable device like a Walkman, you can use that. There are two ways to do this:<br />-You can buy a Behringer Uphono, or similar device. You plug the cassette deck into the Uphono, which you plug into your computer. The Uphono is a high quality digitizer. The procedure for digitizing cassettes is the same as buying this unit.<br />-You can plug your cassette player directly into the sound card of your computer and the computer can digitize the music. This just requires a cable. It depends upon the sound card in your computer how good the results will be.<br />-There is free software on line to help you with either method. Audacity is the most popular but there are others. This cassette player comes with Audacity software on a mini CD.<br /><br />This cassette player is of mediocre quality. It is definitely not as good as any home cassette deck. And, most portable Walkman type players I have heard are better than this. Beside not having great playback, this unit sometimes adds in additional noise. The noise can be bad sometimes, sounding like a helicopter. I get my best results if I don't put the cassette player on the computer.<br /><br />But, if you don't already have a cassette player, then this might be worth getting. The quality of most prerecorded tapes is poor to begin with. You could make a lot better sounding cassette tape at home by recording an LP with a tape deck than if you bought a pre recorded tape in a record store. So, even though this is not a high fidelity unit, you really aren't loosing that much because the sound quality of most cassette tapes is poor. In the early 1980s, cassette tapes sales surpassed LP sales by a wide margin. What boosted the CD is that it was so much better than cassettes and quickly killed the cassette business.<br /><br />This unit comes with a mini CD with Audacity software. Audacity is free software that you can download for free from the Audacity website. The Audacity software lets you capture the music on to your computer and also lets you edit the music files to improve the sound. The benefit of loading the Audacity software from the mini CD instead of the website is that the mini CD sets up all the correct defaults.<br /><br />Digitizing cassette tapes is long, tedious work and not for the computer novice. Here are the steps;<br />-Load the Audacity software and set it up as instructed.<br />-Plug cassette player into computer with USB cable.<br />-Play cassette and push the record button on the Audacity software to record the music on your computer.<br />--&#62;From here, you can either record individual songs or you can record the whole side and then split up the songs later. Either way is tedious.<br />Here is how I do it:<br />-Record the whole side of the tape.<br />-Import the whole side as a WAV file (the Audacity software will show you how to do it).<br />-Load the file back into Audacity.<br />-Run the noise reduction software to eliminate the tape hiss and the extra noise this unit sometimes adds.<br />-Separate the songs out one by one. With the Audacity software, it is easy to tell where one song starts and ends. You then just cut out all the other songs.<br />-Export the song. Use the song title as the file name.<br />-A window pops up asking for song info, such as album and artist. Fill that in.<br />-Repeat for all songs on that side.<br /><br />But, with the poor quality of cassette tapes and the work involved, you got to wonder if it is worth doing this.<br />Well, I am because my wife had a bunch of cassette tapes, she does not care about sound quality and she is not worried about me wasting my time on anything as long as I am doing something for her.",3,2

"quality was not good and it didnt even work from 2nd day i bought. i emailed several times but the dylan didnt response. dont use it.<br />They resend new unit after I returned.<br />The sound was good this time but I think the problem is cable connection.<br />the speaker becomes disconnected frequently and when ouch I tthe cable or move my connected device, it starts making noise.<br />I don't know whether it is the cable problem or speaker outlet problem.<br />also, charging cable is too short. I can't even charge with my computer because I have to hold the speaker to charge using my computer.<br />I can't not put the speaker on the desk or computer. It would be just hanging.",3,2
It's okay Not Bad,3,2
It looks really pretty and I like how I can still see the color of the ipod. The only problem is that I have a lot of trouble taking it on and off. The ipod won't fit on the speaker system or the radio transmitter if the case is on.,3,1
"Device worked well for couple months.  Loved having the display below the window and convenient for viewing.

"just molded plastic nothing special, although my 8 year old daughter likes it and that's all that, matters in the end.",3,1
"At first, I did not receive my product, but after contacting the company, they were very polite and sent a new one. The product works well sometimes, but if there is any hint of another signal on the station you tune to, the sound quality goes down significantly unless you put your hand over the transmitter.<br /><br />Overall, fine for what I use it for, but there are definitely better products out there.",3,1
"This works OK except the supplied fuse has such a low rating that is useless for most applicatioins.  If you buy it, immediately unscrew the tip and take out the supplied fuse.  Put in a 1/4&#34; by 1 1/4&#34; fuse rated at 20 or 25 amps and screw the tip back on.",3,2
"I bought this for my 4s and have never used it. I'm sure it works fine but it won't work with my otter box case because the case is too big. If you have a case on your phone it probably wouldn't work for you either. Be careful when you buy it but if you don't have a case, you should be fine.",3,2
Works very well. But you have to add some extra glue because the heat take the base and the LEDs apart.,3,1
Product is as expected. Some signal loss.,3,1
"good package for the price. if you had a windshield mount and you just wanted to keep your unit out of sight, or take with you without getting dinged up this will work great for you. the only drawback for me, is i keep my garmin on the bean bag style dash mount with the power adapter and use it for my job making deliveries. i just grab the whole thing and bring it in and out of the truck at the start and end of my shift, so i only use this case if i know we are traveling where i may need this for a short time. it does work great for that purpose, but is only realistic for the unit itself. you will not fit it with a mounting piece or a designated car charger with the whole cigarette lighter plug... you could fit a usb cord only....",3,1

There are two problems with it:<br />1) When reading in horizontal mode, it's very easy to accidentally press side-buttons of Boox with the edge of the cover. This is very annoying and often causes the page to change in the least expected moments.<br />2) The stylus holder is badly designed, it holds the stylus well but causes much strain on the cover when the stylus is in, which makes the leather fold weirdly. It also looks rather delicate and will likely break in several months.",3,1

"I just returned my Timex and went with an easier to use Garmin 210. The unit itself is ok. I liked the way it fit on my wrist (had a Garmin 305 before and never liked the way it fit), but I did find that the pace was off. What normally was a 7 minute pace on my Garmin was showing as a 8 to 8 and half minute pace on the Timex. I went and did some research after I bought the unit (should have done the research before) and found out that this was something normal on the Timex.  The main problem I had and why I returned it was trying to download the firmware updates (which you will need to do to get the unit to work better). You need to be a computer whiz (which I am not) to figure out how to modify your firewall etc (if you are running Norton's) to allow the updates to download etc. It says on the Timex web site if you are doing this in your office to call your IT people. Really?   The unit itself is not bad, but it could be better. I think Garmin is still the way to go if you are looking for a GPS unit.",3,2
"I really like everything about it, but I always have to sync the bluetooth.At least I have a cool looking case.",3,1
Worked great while it lasted and then all of the sudden it wasn't working anymore so that is why I give only 3 stars. I'd say it lasted about 6 months.,3,2

"The product works and everything about it is great but the volume......I was hoping it would be louder according to the reviews and description. I like the way it functions and the quality of the sound even at full volume is nothing I would complain about. The price is right for what it has to offer but I guess I was hoping for that rare find where the company has made a product that excels in quality but can still offer it at an economically advantageous price. I can still use it and have not gone broke trying it out so all in all I am happy with the product.<br />I am truly looking for some portable speakers/stereo system for under $50 that I can hook my phone up to, loud enough to use in my car without having to install a new car stereo (our car has expensive car stereo issues of the non working kind that will have to wait until we have the money to spend on something like that). IF there is such a product for that price in existance that some one has been extremely happy with I am open to comments and suggestions. I realize it might be asking too much. Thanks so much!",3,1
"Antenna works great, however, the adhesive isn't the best. I bought this for my car, after someone broke off my antenna on the outside of the car.

I should have been suspicious when the item was described to fit a Nook2.  Actually, I called Barnes and Noble before ordering, and asked about the difference between a Nook and a Nook2.  They claimed to not recognize the \\""2\\"" version, and assured me that Barnes & Noble only makes one 7\\"" Nook HD.  There is no other version.  So, somewhere there's a mix-up in the description.  Since the item comes from the UK, there might be some other model available overseas that is not sold in the US.  In any case, I have subsequently checked the details posted on the Tuff-luv item page and, yes, the dimensions are smaller than the 7\\"" Nook.  But, to be honest, I never bothered to compare dimensions, because I relied on the case description and on the information I received from Barnes & Noble.  So, BEWARE!  Unless you have a device that would fit inside this adorable Tuff-luv case, I advise choosing another cover.  By the way, I contacted Amazon's customer service to help with the return.  They were amazing!  I'll be returning the item to an address in Indiana, so no overseas postage required.  And, Amazon guarantees the refund.  The dealer was also very responsive and sent instruction for return.",3,2
"The foot rest works very well.  But the fresh rubber odor is offensive.  I've kept it outdoors - in the sunshine.  I washed it with water, vinegar, cologne, talcum powder.  That's one stubborn odor, but it is bearable now.",3,1
"The case is thin, but looks good on. I do have reception problems with the case on. Don't know if its the new phone?",3,1
Bought this for use on my Rand McNally RV GPS. Worked OK but had to modify it a bit (added wider sides and top) and is much better now.,3,1
"It looks cute on my Nook Color and fits very nicely. It does not offer much protection and I suspect that it could break easily if dropped just so. The paint around the edges looks little scratched. Honestly, this is just for looks- if you want to protect your device this probably isn't going to do a whole lot.",3,1
"Unit works ok, with the right station, but not as good as the previous Zune transmitter I had. The previous one had the transmitter and charger in one. This one is a transmitter with a separate power cord. I don't mind the design; just stating that the other unit seemed to work better.  One small problem. The clip that disconnects the power cord from the transmitter is missing. I was able to connect the cord to the transmitter, but now I cannot remove it. Not the end of the world, since it still works. However, I emailed the company over 20 days ago and have yet to hear a response.  For the cheap price, it is a good deal. But forget about customer service.",3,1
Not the great sound I hoped for.,3,1
"After reading reviews on several types of charger/transmitters thought I'd give this one a try. For the price if nothing else it will charge my ipod in the car. Sound quality not great- a lot of static/popping- radio generally sounds better. From other reviews that I read sound is usually better in more rural areas(less interference?)Quality of item in general not great- plastic feels light weight, like it would be easy to break but for the price item seems okay.",3,2
I bought this for my 6 yeR old son's iPod which he got for his birthday. It was too big for him and I am not sure how long it will last. iPod seems to fit fine and would be pretty secure.,3,1
good.but battery back up is not sufficient.,3,2
I was just hoping not to see the rainbow affect but i see it. the back cover is semi-mat which i don't know why but overall its an ok product. its easy to apply.,3,2
"I wondered why the price was so low.  It's because it lacks a digital tuning circuit.  Tuning seems to drift when on a given station, but it is certainly good enough at the price.",3,1
After a week stopped working,3,2
Did not last ling.  Gone after 1 year.,3,2
"This carpet is MUCH darker than it appears-it's more along the lines of mocha or peanut butter than tan. It's a good quality product,but the color description is not correct.",3,1
The cable itself looks and feels pretty good.  My first cable would only charge in one direction so I had to make sure to plug it in the correct side up.  The second cable seemed to be a lot better.  Have only used for a few days but it looks promising.,3,1
I should have returned the Item it would not charge my Asus TF101 in the Car. I was very disappointed so once my battery died to more movies on my trip.  :-(,3,2
I thought these cases were a great buy at first they fit they iPod great and look great too. The only problem I had was with the case interfering with the screen protector. Every time we put one of the cases on the screen protector lifted up. A little disappointed.,3,1
"But unfortunately one of the adjuster arms broke off during installation, and I have not been able to use it.",3,2
Antenna break off too easy,3,1
"The Belkin DualFit Sport Arm band is a solid product overall, but has some major drawbacks. I bought this one to replace a previous Belkin Sport Arm Band that I had beat up over the past 3.5 years.     Pros: The plastic screen area responds much better to touch than previous versions; an important aspect to consider when you want to change the volume, advance or go back a track, etc., while in the middle of a workout. It also has a notched slot at the bottom to allow syncing/charging without having to remove from the arm band. The neoprene and velcro arm band allow for your size adjustment to stay firmly where it is without flinging off in the middle of an intense cardio session or other highly active use.    Cons: I know I don't have the biggest arms in the world, but the only way for me to get this to fit is by having the velcro adjustment at the largest setting. With the amount of strain being put on the rest of the arm band and (p)leather adjustment notch, I don't see this holding up for very long. It's certainly not as long or sturdy as the first generation Belkin Sport Arm Band designed a few years ago for the 160GB iPod Classic.    Recommendation: Since this is the only model Belkin now makes, users are pretty much stuck buying it. I believe Belkin should either make a drastic change in the length of the arm band or market this as a DualFit Sport Arm Band for women & guys with small/skinny arms.",3,1
"The pink case was not like the purple one, it was not enclosed like the purple one on the bottom.  They are not rubber.  When it says rubber hard skin, I was looking for the rubber material, but it was more of a snap on hard plastic case.  If they are dropped, they come apart very easily.  For the price, you get what you pay for.",3,2
Cords tangle in housing but still operable. Not a serious problem but should be addressed to satisfy all potential customers.,3,2
It's a really attractive and cute case but cannot be closed when the head phones or charger are plugged in.,3,2
They do fit and they do work but when I got mine in the mail there were a few issues on the lens of one of the turn signals.  I just wet sanded and buffed it out and it looked good.  I wouldn't expect that to have happened on all of them though.  And like I said they worked great on my SV,3,1
"Item was of the quality I was hoping for, but it needed modified to work with the Android that I had ordered it to use with.  My Granddaughter was very happy with the color.",3,1
Good sound definition in a small package but the battery seem to lose its charge after a week or so.,3,1
"yes they came really quick, not late, and looks great on the black ipod. the sun light affects the way you view the screen, but was told in the reviews. but heres the other thing, no one said it had a rainbowish light effect on the screen that hurts your eyes. i dont write a reviews, but felt that i had to write this so incase someone tries to buy as a gift for someone.",3,1
"Not the best quality product but does the job, customer service is awesome thou! Fit my car adapter and my Outerbox",3,1
In color blue???,3,2
I am changing my review. There are some problems with this item and here they are.<br />1. It will not stay plugged in if you hit a bump. Solution plug it in with a USB cable to it's USB port the cable will not pop out of the socket.<br />2. If you have a power port in the back of your vehicle plug it in there and forget about it. It will reach your radio no problem and stays out of the way and plugged up.<br />3.My HTC phone will not play blue tooth through this device leading me to believe the device had failed. I borrowed a Samsung phone and it worked fine. The problem is Car Home Ultra app will not work with this device on my HTC EVO 3D but everything works fine on a Samsung s3.,3,1
"I ordered this player in November 2009 and installed it in January 2010.  By the second week of March 2010 the TFT flip up display would not come out and flip up.  It wasn't dropped and was installed by a professional.  Also, it gets rather hot.  The cooling system could use a little work.  Other than those issues it works and has good qualities.",3,2
"The wall charger works great. The car charger isn't so great. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Nice to have, but not very dependable.",3,1
"Although the TV did have an issue with the caution from this company that they may not fix it, may swap it out for another type, or refund me I was not happy when I got the full disclaimer.  Would not buy this service again.<br /><br />They sent a box for the TV to go in and said make sure everything was included but sent no packing materials or a way to prevent the heavy stand from smashing into the TV itself.<br /><br />Ended up dealing with TV issue and let this expire.  Never again.",3,2
"When it's done, it's done.    Pros:  I like the lighting level and options, the clip is very secure, and you can stand it on its base on a desk to illuminate a keyboard. Like the color, too.    Cons:  I have bought four of these over the past couple of years and as of now only one is still bright, because I took it apart and fooled with the connection. Two are very dim, and one has konked out completely. I use them with adapters, not batteries.    One thing I never thought about on initial purchase was that there are no replacement LEDs; at least, none that I am aware of. As another reviewer commented elsewhere, the replacement bulbs are for the classic Mighty Bright that has the mini-bulbs you actually thread into the fixture; they are not for the LED lights.    Not sure how long these should last and while I've used them a lot, when I add up what I've paid for the lights and adapters, methinks I paid too much. Editing a 5-star review down to a 3.",3,1
"The product looks cheap, unlike the pictures show.  It does not fit in my 2005 Honda Accord Coup beside the shift handle, or it fits awkwardly.  I then hook it up with the lighter in the box/seat arm and it fits better but still awkwardly. It is not on automatically when starting up, and tuning up may take some effort, especially in the squeezed seat arm box. Signal was better in country areas, but have noise in every channel when I drive to Cherry Hill, NJ which is 10 miles from Philly.  I would not buy it if I knew all these, but feel it is OK to use.  By the way, the shipping from Satechi is fast, except the box was not sealed.<br /><br />After less than one month of using it, it broke.  I contacted Satechi, who was very helpful, and sent me a label for shipping it back.  I actually ordered another FM transmitter from them.  I would still recommend them",3,2
"This dvd/gps player is a bargain if you can get it for under $140 . Like stated the GPS Support is not the best So if you do lots of cross country traveling I suggest you spend more money on a better GPS system . You can save a home in a work location. It does give you options for different turn by turn voices. I like the British woman's accent. The GPS will briefly interrupt audio playing thru the radio or DVD player smoothly. My biggest issue with the radio is a simple one, \\""time display \\"" . It does not show time on the radio stations or while playing a DVD. There's no button to press to check time. I have to go through the settings just to check the time unless unless I'm in GPS mode. So if your running late and needa to check the the time, its safer to check it on your cell then pressing the 3-4 button sequence on the radio. Other than those things it's a decent gps radio for the price but I wouldn't dare pay over $140 for it.",3,2
"This is a very pretty sleeve, and it is more durable than I was anticipating when I looked at the image.  I expected it to be thin and possibly fragile, but bought it anyway because I'm crazy about purple and I figured it was worth the risk.  First, for anyone doing the same thing I was, be aware this is actually less purple than it looks in the picture.  The \\""Purple\\"" sleeve is definitely pink.  It is not fragile, though.  The problem is actually that the sleeve is made out of a plastic material that is a little too hard.  The sleeve covers the volume buttons, and it is difficult to impossible to push these buttons while the sleeve is on.  Nonetheless, it is still pretty and it serves the purpose of protecting my iPod touch.  I am still using mine and find I can deal with its shortcomings.",3,1
"Purchased 3 of these, they work great and have a good picture, one of the three had a flaky power connection (lost power when you would bend the wire). Pulled it off and re-soldered and it's fine now.",3,1
"When I first got this at Christmas (2009) I loved it and it worked great! Very little static is you just turn the treb down and I found out even less static if you put your iPod on standby mode while listening to a song. However, after mulitple uses, maybe six or seven, it started to loose it's audio output and I found out one of the prongs came loose and slides. This little problem meant to sound on the whole right side of the car. Then when I tried to also tighten the backing, it came loose and won't hold the iPod up. Cheaply made and not worth the money. Better have been made before.",3,2
"I picked this up thinking that I will be the next great triathlete.  Not really, I picked this up because Sports Authority had it mis-priced and I got it for like $200 off (plus I received a $25 Gift Certificate too!).  I was in the market for something that would help me track my swimming calories and progress.  I am definitely one of those people that get motivated to work out more and harder if I can track my progress.  I am no good keeping logs, etc and I like something that does it automatically for me.  I have been a fan of the whole Nike+ community and this seemed to be the next step (no pun intended).        Obviously I know that this is meant for outside.  However, I was hoping that since the lap pool in my gym is completely encased in glass that it would work through the glass, I was incorrect.  It does not work at all.  The best this can do is keep track of my laps and that has to be done manually so I had to get into the rhythm of hitting the \\""lap\\"" button whenever I completed one.  Very annoying.  Also, I could not find anything that spoke of whether the heart monitor was water resistant.  Obviously this watch is meant for a triathlete so you would assume that it would be but I just wanted to make sure.  Finally I gave up and called Timex and was told that it was.  Other swimmers warned me that heart monitors are not accurate in swimming and that they can fold up, etc which interrupts your workout.  I found that if I wore the heart monitor strapped diagonally across my chest that it wouldn't do this so I did not have any of the problems they described.    I DO have a complaint about how accurate the calorie count is though.  I was a Bodybugg wearer for a LONG time and it always seemed that all devices I used kind of agreed on calorie count, except for this.  While the Bodybugg would say 800 calories burned in 45 minutes and the Nike+ said 725 calories burned, the Timex would log 2100 calories burned on a run in 45 minutes.  Totally off!    The final complaint I had was with how long the GPS takes to connect.  Even after letting the initial connection sync.  If I turned the GPS off, it would take 15 minutes to reconnect.  This was in a wide open area with a complete panoramic view of the sky from horizon to horizon.  Also, this was the same experience here in the US (New Jersey, Las Vegas, and Ohio) as well as Europe (UK, Germany, Belgium and Greece).  The GPS NEVER connected quickly, however once it did it was pretty stable connection.    I do have to give props to the TrainingPeaks web site.  I really loved it.  The watch syncs data to it pretty easily and the ability to log food is GREAT.  The site had a lot more food already available than some of the other sites and there was an Android app available to me.  I was VERY happy with that.  I highly recommend that feature.  PROS: Training Peaks integration, Easy sync with PC or Mac, Once the watch connected, it was stable, battery lasts a LONG time  CONS: Not a quick/easy connection to GPS, Only outdoor swimming (not even through glass), BIG watch, inaccurate calorie count",3,1
"I bought this skin sticker about a month ago after being unable to find a protective case for my recently purchased sanza mp3 player. It's just what it says, not a protective case like on an ipod but a thick sticker that covers the front and back (though not the sides). It fits well but I wasn't sure if the middle part of the sticker was supposed to go on the mp3 player (I assume not since the picture shows the center wheel/button uncovered) but my past experiences have told me those buttons tend to fade so I stuck the center circle sticker part on my wheel/button and it makes navigating a bit harder. What I'm saying is, if you buy this, you shouldn't put the center sticker in the center wheel of your sanza mp3 player.<br /><br />Overall, the design is beautiful and so far the sticker is holding up on the protection part (wish it would cover the sides!) but it's only been a month so I'll see how long it lasts.",3,2
"I like this ok, and it's worth it for the money, but it's not quite as good as I'd hoped.  It does have some of the problems that others described... sometimes the stereo goes out and I listen through one ear, and I think that the waterproof aspect needs some improvement.  I also don't love the controls (or lack thereof).  It's a little frustrating when I'm in the pool and I am struggling with turning it on or skipping songs, etc...  All in all, I am glad I got it to see if I would like having music in the water (I DO), but I think I'll probably invest in a better one later.",3,1
"It took a month for the product to get to me from China.  If we can put a man on the moon, I should be able to get a package from China, quicker than a month's timeframe.  The bulbs came packaged nicely to help prevent any damage along its shipping path.  As far as output, don't expect too much, but they look nice with my headlight LED's, and they produce a brilliant white light on the Kelvin scale.",3,1
"The screen is great for protection, however I was disappointed that it does not help with any kind of glare what so ever.",3,2
"It does its job well enough, I only have a couple complaints. When I took it out of the package, the clear plastic cover was foggy with some kind of residue, and I couldn't get it completely off (this is probably just specific to my item though). My other complaint is that when I run with it on and start to sweat, I notice a pretty considerable amount of condensation near the bottom of the product (near the home button on the iPod), which is terrible for the iPod. I cut a slit in the plastic to try to air it out, but I haven't tried it yet.",3,1
"JVC's definitely changed over the last 6 years. My old stereo basically shook my truck all night long. This unit was as good, that is till I hooked a sub up. Don't get me wrong, the one minus outweighed the the plus's. If you go through the head units setting's they are a bit tricky, but you get used to them. It has one of the best EQ setups on the market, and boasts a pretty decent Amplifier section. Nissan owners note if you have the base line model to upgrade your speakers to anything. So having started off with this, Lets go to the problem with the monster.<br /><br />After installing my Boss Riot 600 watt Sub amp and Pyle 10&#34; Bluewave subwoofer, Dual 6x9's and matching 6.5&#34; 4 way speakers. I noticed I couldn't get the sound to dial in right. I feared cheeping on the sub section was the real problem. After about a day of playing with sub on/off, changing frequencies, turning on/off bass boost, things started looking bleak. Going through the settings one last time I changed Line Out settings from &#34;Sub&#34;, which wouldn't' cross with the door drivers (and was muddy as hell), to &#34;Rear&#34;, It instantly fixed the problem! The subs started hitting and the system crossed together.<br /><br />I have had Pioneer, older JVC's, hell even Optimus that never gave this problem. Its the worst Lineout mode ever. Brings the 4 stars to a three, And I will be getting a Pioneer shortly. Everything else works like it should.",3,1
I bought it for my son but ended up using it more than he.  It's compact and installed quickly.  My only concern is that there is no way to secure it to the cover.  It stays in place with magnets but wish there were more to keep it in place because it does slide off of the cover with ease.,3,1
Not too fond of this case.  It is hard to use it as a clip when it is in its case.  Would have rather had something else.,3,2
"On sale for $20 its a great product for the money. It has the quirk that if you want to change track you tap a button, and to increase the volume you press the same button only you hold it down.<br /><br />Bluetooth was bad, it pairs fine and sounds good enough, only several times per song it will have hickups of silence that last about a second each. This is with my phone right next to the device. My phone hasnt had such an issue with my Urge Basics bluetooth speaker or any other bluetooth device.",3,1
Quick shipping! Product itself is fairly cheap quality but that's expected for a no-name Bluetooth speaker. Sound quality is mediocre at best but it gets the job done for music in the bathroom. The key point here is that it works correctly without any issues. Charger is a small pin-style and not micro USB like most products these days. It paired easily to my iPhone 6 Plus with no hesitation and all buttons/features work flawlessly. Would buy again if I showered in multiple locations.,3,1
The case isnt leather. It wasnt what i expected when I recieved it. It blocks the sound and its hard to press the buttons on the nook because its almost blocked.,3,2
I think that the anti glare screen protector was difficult to get perfectly on with no bubbles and feel that this product could be installed onto the device at manufacturing. seems like a moneymaker to me. It kept getting bubbles no matter how I used the attached tool to get them out. I would not purchase again.,3,2
"The GPS unit is okay, basic BT gps. Thus just an average 3 star rating. BT works fine, accuracy is okay.   You do need to JB an ipad to use with it though, unlike a couple other models. The Hz switch is good too.    But beware of the seller here, DBROTH, because they will ship you a different model instead. I ordered twice from them and both times they shipped a different unit and now Im stuck without anything for my weekend trip.    GPS unit is 3 Stars, pretty decent. Seller DBROTH is 0 stars. Just look at their reviews and you'll see they have a history of this little scam. I warned you...",3,1
this unit is ok but not the best quality item. the image comes in fuzzy and can be hard to set up. I do not recommend this for a novice user.,3,2
this little line out dock works fine but will not hook to 3gs with otter box gotta work on a little,3,1
"I bought this last year for my stepdaughter's Ipod Touch. The case was decent and the kickstand held up the iPod well, but it didn't stay closed once she'd used it several times. It just sort of swung loose. Also the accessories broke the first day. It was not the best quality but for the price I didn't expect top quality, especially in the accessories. I would probably not buy it again.",3,2
Looks great not sure on how it functions it doesn't fit my antenna base,3,1
"I took this on my travels from France across Spain.  It worked great when I could find a socket that fit the big square.  I also bought a smaller adapter and ended up just giving this adapter to someone else, keeping this cord and using it with the smaller adapter.",3,1
"Product does what it's designed to do in that it charges your iPhone and syncs to your computer.  I was able to jailbreak with this cable.  The plastic material is not so nice as the finish is matte and not uniformly white.  If you're one who likes your gadgets looking cool, this isn't for you.  If it's just functionality and good price you're looking for then you can't go wrong with this one.",3,1
"This case looks good from outside. But, for the one that I bought, when I open it, the cut-off window does not align well with the iPod. The top cut-off is slanted, not completely horizontal, so there is an almost flat white triangle exposing the iPod white front surface. Somehow it is annoying.",3,2
adorable what i expected just wish it would not get so dirty easily and come off easily but i like it.,3,1
Sounds great and I wouldn't trade but not as loud as I expected and maybe just because everyone raves about em so much you expect insane noise,3,1
"These earpieces work ok, but seem to only last about a month, before they don't relay the sound from the radio to the ear anymore.  Probably cheaply made as I use it three times a week for eight hours per day.<br />I started using this ear piece on July 1st and it barely lasted until July 30th. 100 hrs total use time.  Looking for one that is more durable!",3,2
Cd played not good,3,2
"this was ok kind of slippery and the headphones it came with was very cheaply done, the sound quality was horrible, the screen protector was good for the nook over all could have done with out the headphones.",3,2
"Very loud, which my son likes. Quality is not the greatest. Hope it lasts for a little while. Doesnt pop up with base like it says it should.",3,2
"After being sent a replacement unit by the seller, I am actually decently impressed with the camera for the price.<br />For the record this is the knock off version of the Video Recorder A8 dashcam.<br />It lacks the physical mic switch, and many of the settings options like being able to choose video file lenghts. But still does the trick nicely.<br /><br />Video quality of recordings is actually pretty decent, although the live view suffers from a slightly lower frame rate than the recording.<br /><br />The unit has no battery, contrary to other reviews, that's why it has both a 12V+ constant, and 12+ switched acc power wire. Make sure you wired it right.<br /><br />Although I am actually fairly impressed with this unit for the money as I stated earlier, I am only upgrading my rating to 3 stars from 1 because of the headache involved in actually getting a working unit.<br /><br />Original Review below.<br />----------------------------------<br />Title: Worst Amazon.com experience EVER<br /><br />I will change this when and if the seller gets back to me, but so far they haven't.<br /><br />This took the better part of three weeks to arrive from China, just to be severely disappointed...<br /><br />I ordered this based on the photos provided, which showed it to be a known good model, identifiable by the physical microphone switch on top. Known knock offs lack this switch.<br /><br />Upon receiving the camera, I opened it noticing that the bubble wrap around the camera was old and already torn up indicating that the package had already been opened. Going further into the package, I took out the wiring harness noticing that the ends of the wires had been stripped back and were badly frayed, I got even angrier... I reached into the bottom of the box to remove what I thought was the instruction paperwork only to find that the papers were actually SOMEONE ELSE'S AMAZON RETURN PAPERWORK!!! These papers included the previous buyer's name, address, and written complaint that the unit was defective and didn't work!<br /><br />This is by far the worst online buying experience I have ever had. To take known junk, not even remove the evidence that it is junk, sell it as new and just throw a new mailing label on it?! Really?!",3,2
I have had this for a few days replacing the factory satellite receiver and reception is constantly sporadic.  I figured this would work better attaching it to the trucks mirror but the signal is constantly in and out even when idle.  The connection is solid and I even replaced the main unit but nothing has changed.  Very frustrated as I listen to my satellite radio all the time.,3,2
"I use this to hold my phone when I am running and walking.  I can control the phone through the plastic, but of course it is less responsive than with no cover.  The binding on the edge of the phone gets in the way of my power and volume buttons, but I just press on the neoprene beneath and they work fine.  The velcro band must be connected carefully so there is no overlap.  If the scratchy part of the velcro extends beyond the edge of the strap, it can scratch your skin. I would expect this with almost any velcro band. Also, there's a little flap over a ring.  If that flap gets folded under it can pinch your skin. I am satsified with the product.",3,1
"These are almost the exact same thing as the Pyle super tweeters. One IMPORTANT thing to know that will save you tons of headache: If the panel you are installing this tweeter on is too thin, the mounting screws will bottom out on the solder connections of the voice coil to the terminals and cause catastrophic failure! I'm ashamed to say, but I couldn't figure it at first and assumed I had defective tweeters. When I realize what was happening it was very obvious. The supplied mounting screws are long enough to short to the terminals and/or force their way into the solder connections enough to destroy the contact. I ruined 3 tweeters before I figured out what was happening, but fortunately I was able to salvage them by re-soldering the connections. These would be awesome tweeters if the documentation was better and warned you of this pitfall. I wasted a TON of time because of this issue, and not happy. Otherwise, they sound decent when they work.",3,2
"I listen to them all took back the small Jab Box looked around, wen't to a friends home and he had the UEBOOM I went the next day to pick one up! on the 4th, we where riding the bikes to Huntington Beach and in the crowd... really crowed, they were singing to my music on the UEBOOM!! I was cracking up!!!",3,1
"I purchased this after having a disappointing experience with Jambox, which sounded great on the first day, then sounded distorted afterwards. There are some idiosyncrasies with setting up a wireless speaker over Bluetooth. Firstly, just because your Bluetooth works OK for mice and so on, don't assume that you have the right drivers for streaming music.  You need an additional layer known as Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) and, if you don't have the right driver set loaded, audio won't work, even though other Bluetooth devices do.<br /><br />After spending a lot of time (several hours), I finally managed to get my USB 3.0 Medialink adapter (purchased from Amazon) which uses the Broadcom BCM2070 chipset working correctly by going to this support link: support DOT gateway DOT com/support/drivers/getFile.asp?id=23452&dscr=Broadcom%20BRM2045%20and%20BRM2046%20Bluetoot%20h%20Driver%20Version%206.2.1.500&uid=24766478<br /><br />I also found another strange facet which is that the speaker installed as both an input (recording) device, as well as a playback device. This led the sound level to be very low and distorted. Trough much trial and error, I found that by disabling the device as an input device, the sound became much louder and fidelity was very good. You can change this setting by right clicking on the speaker icon at the bottom of the Windows screen, and choosing playback (and recording) devices, and disabling it for everything except playback of audio.<br /><br />Beatblock came without any useful documentation, and there is nothing on their web-site, which sucks.<br /><br />The build quality appears significantly higher than for Jambox. The unit is encased in a rubber chassis, which feels nice to the touch and is sturdy. It will provide some waterproofing as well. There are just three controls on the top, which are easily accessible. Generally, I like how the device looks, which is important as it lives permanently on my desk.<br /><br />On the downside, the power switch is difficult and fiddly to access, and looks as though it may break. A power switch on the top with the other buttons, with something more sturdy, would have been so much better.<br /><br />There is a large, bright and very annoying flashing blue LED on the front panel. I will probably cover this with insulation tape, or may even open the unit up to cut the connection. It is a silly thing to do to a unit that, aesthetically, looks very nice.<br /><br />Sound quality is very good, and it is surprisingly loud and satisfying for such a small speaker.<br /><br />All in all I would buy this device again. Getting it to work (which more a problem of Windows and Bluetooth) was a nightmare but, having gone through a very painful learning curve, I'm sure that I could install the unit again much more quickly.",3,1

"I received this product free of charge from a voucher code in exchange for a review.<br /><br />This crescent magnet thing is pretty cool. I have a big phone (who doesn't nowadays? The smallest one is a friggin regular iPhone 6). With the weight of my phone and the case, the magnet still holds it up. I followed some of the examples the product comes with and put it on the side of my microwave and refrigerator, as well as on a door and under the table because why not. You have to get creative with the position of the phone inside of the holder or it balances out on its side or slides down because...you know...physics  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br /><br />I like it in my car a lot. The magnet that it rests on comes with a 3M tape sticker thing, and you know 3M is not messing around. It sticks pretty well and I live in a place where the temperature gets above 100 degrees and tape can be questionable.  I use it to hold my phone and use it as a dashcam because it's always been a dream of mine to be as Russian as possible.<br /><br />So the standalone magnet with the 3M tape is strong, but the drawback is the circular magnet on the actual crescent itself. After about 5 hours of moving it around and placing it different places (I'm dedicated) the magnet on the crescent actually came out. The glue is all still attached to the magnet itself (should've used 3M tape on each piece). It fits back in and doesn't slide around or anything but it could get looser and make the product obsolete.",3,1

The green cover is a bit sloppy and loose fitting. I thought the cord would be a good way to use the mp3 in my car but it doesn't work as expected. That may be due to the age of the mp3 player - possibly outdated technology?

"I write a halfway mark on this product only because if your serious about the Air Fuel Ratio and accuracy; you would use a wideband gauge setup.  This (narrow band) will give you the interpretation of your cars existing 02 sensor.  This range will not be sufficient enought to determine overall performance.  The cost of wideband setup does force many of us to try and scale down in order to fit our budgets therefore, we purchase this product. Do research and determine what you really want the gauge for. If for looks and somewhat of a reading, this will be something that will be a pleasant light show. IF your a racer looking for pinpoint data. Wideband is the only way to go.",3,1

"So the charger plugs into this instead of directly into the SoundDock III. Okay, great. That's about it! The only benefit is that you don't have to plug/unplug the SoundDock each time you want to take it somewhere, since it just sits on this cradle.<br /><br />If someone can tell me why this is worth the $35 I spent, I'm all ears.",3,1
"The controls are microscopic and very difficult to see, let alone manipulate.  The instructions are a very poor translation from Chinese.  Here is an example; \\""If meet the key operate invalid,LED lamp NO flash, to use a USB line round head by buttons at a concave to reset can.\\"" HUH????<br />Loading the playlist took several hours.  I like to have my music shuffle throughout the artists and music.  This seems to play only from front to back. I didn't see anything in the English instructions remotely related to getting it to shuffle the music, but that doesn't mean it can't be done.  There are Chinese instructions on the back of the English instructions. The English side has steps numbered 1 through 10.  The Chinese side has steps numbered 1 through 12.  I'll have to go to a Chinese restaurant and get a translation of steps 11 and 12.  Maybe I can get this thing to shuffle yet.<br /><br />All that having been said.  It does play music.  I haven't been in the pool yet, so I don't know if it is waterproof.  Maybe if I get it wet, it will shuffle.  I already know I made a mistake. But, it was a cheap one.  I will be replacing this soon.",3,2

"Recently, in the midst of the mid-summer doldrums, I decided to \\""live a little,\\"" as the saying goes. Even though the GoGear Vibe does not officially support Mac OS X, I threw all caution to the wind and ordered one up. So how did my impulsive and gutsy move work out?<br /><br />Well, it *is* possible to drag-copy MP3 and .jpg files to the Vibe, using the Finder, when the Vibe is connected to a USB port using the supplied cable. The Vibe shows up on the Mac desktop as a USB drive. AAC music files (the format used by the iTunes Store), unfortunately, do not play on the Vibe. I also was not able to get any of my video files to play. The screen is so small, though, that I don't really care.<br /><br />The Vibe isn't a bad media player. It has acceptable sound quality and the user interface is reasonably intuitive. There are a couple of significant design flaws: the headphone jack and the volume control buttons are located on opposite ends of the device and there isn't any visual indication of progress or time remaining when the Vibe is charging. Both of these flaws detract from the overall usability.<br /><br />I think the Vibe is best suited for people who want an inexpensive media player for, say, their children or to use in situations where one might not want to carry a valuable device. I use mine when I go to baseball games on public transit--I can listen to music on the way to and from the ballpark and listen to the play-by-play on the radio during the game. For daily use, however, I prefer another player I own that has a better physical design and a more convenient interface.<br /><br />Bottom line: three stars, due to the two design flaws discussed above.",3,2
"I have dropped my rating to 3 stars because I have not been able to get a unit that the GPS continues to work in. See my comment below. Even with the non-functioning GPS, it's still quite a value given the price and all the other features that work.<br />This is the 2nd SVC radio I have bought from Slimsharp. The first was the 2DIN size (which I'm sorry to report they seem to no longer sell). This one is the 1DIN size that fits my Bronco (the 2DIN went in our Ford motorhome and had a slightly larger screen). The product description on Amazon is very poorly done. So many features are not mentioned. These units are without a doubt the best value in a lower priced radio/GPS you can get. The GPS works well, there is a Bluetooth cell phone connection feature, you can purchase a backup camera and connect it and that can be wired into the backup lights giving you an automatic rear view. There is also an external USB port  and MP3 player socket that allows playing music that way. You can also read ebooks or watch videos off the USB input although why on earth you would I cannot fathom. In the case of motorhomes, there is a video out connection to send video to a larger monitor. More expensive radios sound better but these units easily equal stock units. The enormous set of features makes these a spectacular buy, just don't get one expecting audio to match a $1000 Alpine system (that doesn't have near the features). Just expect a capable, non-audiophile unit and you will be more than pleased. Anyone who has ridden with me and seen either radio is blown away by all the things they do, the touch screen being another big plus. It presents itself as a real radio of tomorrow and as long as you can be satisfied with a 'normal' level of performance, this is your device. There is no CD/DVD player but that's just one less mechanical device to worry about. Who carries a pile of disks anymore when everything you want can fit on one USB thumb drive?",3,1

"I ordered this the Intellinav 3 from the manufacturer's website for 169.00.  This unit replaced my TomTom 700 which had died after three years of regular use.  Upon setting it up the unit  is VERY BASIC compared to the TomTom that passed away. There is only one voice; a robotic sounding female voice. You can not add a voice or change the color combination of the maps as I could with the TomTom.  It has a few directional quirks. For example the road through my town winds and curves.  The Intellinav sees these as turns.  It keeps telling me to turn left/right with every bend while staying on same road!<br /><br />The volume,even at its loudest can not be heard about the AC and radio. I added a set of battery powered speakers, courtesy Radio Shack, and now the unit is nice and loud.<br /><br />Its' ability to find the shortest and fastest route is OK.  Recalculating a route is fairly fast.  And yes, it will announce street names.<br /><br />I wish my TomTom were back...",3,1

"I am using this radio at work and I am about 15 feet from a window on the 3rd (top) floor of my building. It is hard to get a station and when I do it only works for about 30 minutes and then I have to adjust it again. I typically end up frustrated and turn it off. My coworkers with other radios do not have this problem, so it leads me to believe it is the radio. It had good sound and it's a decent size and quality, except for this issue.",3,1
"I would rate this screen protector above average. It's easy to install, although I did mess up by not aligning the sides correctly in my first try, so when I peeled it off to try again some dust got underneath creating 3 smalls bubbles, which is ok, my fault. I like to play fruit ninja on my phone and at first there was a little bit of friction so my finger didn't slide effortlessly across the screen, but again, its ok.. I can live with it. It does get fingerprints easily and you have to really wipe it down well with a cloth or your shirt or something to get all the oils from your face and fingers off. Overall, decent product, satisfied.",3,1

"1st one failed the same day.  Ordered a second one hoping I wouldn't have to pay the installer to completely re-wire everything.  So far so good on the 2nd one.  Amazon return on the bad unit was easy, but the extra labor charge for the partial re-install on the 2nd one was more than the camera cost.  Wasn't the installers fault, and no recourse for me.  A little better quality control would be nice.",3,2
"Okay product. I'm on my second case. The first one i broke, but it was sturdy, it would have been fine. The plastic tabs are a little weak and can be broken if not careful. I use mine almost daily for my workouts and found it to be a nice case in general. For the money, i think it's one of the better ones i've tried (i've tried 3 of them) If you're looking for a basic case with a strongish spring, this would work.",3,2
"This radio was ok for the money that was spent on it (only $50.<br /><br />Goods:<br /> 1. The sound was amazing, never had a problem.<br /> 2. My Cd's never scratched and it could even played MP3 made Cd's.<br /> 3. The LED screen was adjustable for my perfect fit.<br /> 4. The face-plate was easy to remove and it came with a carrying case.<br /><br />Bads:<br /> 1. My settings would never save. Once I would switch from the radio to the CD player, all of my setting would delete. It made no sense and I did a lil research and it was not my instillation, it was the actual player.<br /> 2. When it would get hot, it would just shut off, even if I had just gotten into the car, and not work until it was cool again. That would be fine if it I lived in a place that didn't get too hot, but since I live in the Antelope Valley, that was a major problem.<br /> 3. Sometimes it would not play my burned CD's. My actual store bought CD's I never had a problem playing them, but the CD's I made or bought bootleg did not always play.<br /> 4. I'm not sure if this is normal but when I would try to play Pandora on my phone via the AUX when it was plugged into my car charger the radio would make this high frequency sound. It was really weird, and even when I left it in the AUX mode it still made those sounds just at a lower volume. The AUX mode always made weird noises.<br /><br />Hope this helps. I mean I used it for a year and just got used to the quirks. It played alright until on a hot day when I got in my car and turned it on, it shut off and would not turn back on. I thought it was just having a moment and tried again when it was cool, but even a week later it still would not turn on.",3,2

I definitely recommend to anyone wanting to just listen to their ipod or Pandora in the car. It even says what artist and song are playing! Great item for the price. Also bought this with some other things for the free shipping!<br /><br />Now it is August and the cord no longer charges my phone.

"I had purchased this with the Neucleus Ai Digital iPod Interface, hoping to finally be able to rid myself of cheap-sounding RF modulators for my iPod nano and aftermarket XM radio (I live in a market with a crowded FM band, so there's no such thing as an \\""unused\\"" frequency).  I had done some research elsewhere that suggested this adapter would do the trick, but was mistaken.  Though it installed relatively easily and the unit seemed to initialize OK, the \\""takeover\\"" signal (the key sequence on the radio controls that tell the Neucleus to inject the iPod signal) did not do anything.      It turns out that the 6-disc changer head unit in the 2003 Trailblazer and its GMC doppelganger (Envoy), are neither \\""CD-Changer Ready\\"" nor \\""XM-compatible\\"".  I'm not sure how you'd know that as a casual consumer, so I'm warning anyone else who thought they could get free of RF modulators and still keep their 6-disc changer...there is apparently NO solution on the market that will work with that particular head unit.

Can fill a room as long as the ceilings aren't too high. It also helps if the floor isn't carpeted as that absorbs sound. Very transportable though.<br /><br />Bluetooth wasn't as easy to set up as I was hoping. For the first few days, I would have to disconnect and reconnect multiple times to my computer and phone as it wasn't working well. After a while I got the hang of it. It wouldn't let me play music and charge the speaker at the same time in the beginning, but afterwards it worked??? I don't know.<br /><br />Anyway, I am not unsatisfied with my purchase. I use it. I like it. I just don't love it. And I probably don't use it as much as my laptop speakers (which suck way more) just because its not convenient to turn on.",3,1
I returned the Visor Gizmo -- had trouble installing and making it work. The product contact was amazingly understanding  and allowed a refund.,3,2
"Whats good: This unit fits perfectly into the ZX2 with no modifications. It comes with all wiring harnesses, including those for the rear defrost. It easily fits any radio as long as it is of standard size. The factory climate knobs fit, although it is a tight fit.  Whats not good: The plastic is made of the cheapest available material and feels like it will break in your hands; however, it is not noticeable once the unit is installed. The backlight for the climate controls looks absolutely terrible. There are just a few lights that unevenly supply backlighting. The overall design looks cheap after installation, but that can't be avoided if you want to use an aftermarket radio. The worst thing about this is... It's the only aftermarket radio kit available for the ZX2! I spent a lot of time trying to find different kits and I could not find any. If you want to put a new radio into your ZX2, this will have to work. I just think they could have done better.  Unrelated installation notes: You will need a radio antenna extender. The factory antenna connection is too short to hook up before sliding the radio in place. (Attach the radio to the kit before installation) Also, I couldn't get the rear speakers to work and I had to independently wire them to the radio, but it is possible I wired them incorrectly.",3,1
"So far the product all looks good except for the bad case. The case is a flimsy latex cover for all of the front except the screen. On the side the volume buttons are covered and not lined up correctly. The speaker to headset switch is 80% covered by the case all of the other features have access through the case. At first it is annoying. Don't know if I can get used to it. For the price is why it gets 3 stars from me, going to continue to look for a more sturdy case though.",3,2
works but if i press in enough will act as the call button has been pressed,3,1
"Although there is nothing wrong with this cover and it keeps my Nook Color safe and packaged nicely.  The product looks better in the pictures than in person.  More \\""Pleather\\"" than plastic or actual leather.  Plenty of room for storing additional memory cards and a place for the stylus that comes with the combo pack.  Given the choice again - I might would have ordered a different product and one that comes with a \\""hard-tipped\\"" stylus instead of the soft touch ball on the end of this one.    All-in-all ... a decent cover bundle that does exactly what it says.  I may still order a better cover and stylus later.  The blue has to grown on me a bit more.",3,1
This is also a present !<br />Didn't open the box ! So not much I can say about the product - right ?<br />Looks nice !!!,3,1
"When I got it, it was not the item that I imaged after I saw the picture.It is OK.But...I think it is second hand item.So I felt a little bit disappointed.",3,2
What can you expect for 2 bucks. It works most of the time. I get a message saying that is isn't compatible with my phone probably 1 out of every 4 times I plug it in. It was cheap though.,3,1
"This particular mount does hold the gps higher, but besides being flexible, it's also somewhat unstable.  And I didn't realize how much I used my cup holder actually as a cup holder.",3,1
We did not really like that case because it is hard to push the volume button and it is not very soft. Prefer the Disney Pooh case.,3,2
"Not very useful. I mean, the controlling app cannot start with the Android system. You've got to launch the app manually every time you want to use it. The thing is, since I have realized to launch the controlling app, how can I forget to bring my cellphone?",3,1
"had this installed at a mall kiosk because i thought it would provide good protection. found that the film on sides came off pretty quickly. the front and back stayed but when when i took advantage of the apple free case, even they started to peel off, too. the only Zagg shield left is on the front. lifetime guarantee is a waste since you mail in the \\""defective\\"" shield... not very helpful on the smaller side films since some came off without my realizing until later.",3,2
buttons aren't sturdy (have to feel for them) and suction didn't work so I made a fix for it,3,2
"It was a good product and all, but I expected a real case. It is only stickers that you stick onto your nookcolor. It's really cute and fun, though! :)",3,1
"This product works pretty well but is actually so big that I run out of velcro! As a runner, I see that most other runners are slender in form and I think they could have made it a little smaller or the ability to make it smaller and it would have gotten 5 stars. I plan on rigging it so I do not have to send it back. Can't beat the price though!",3,1
"This screen protector isn't nice and clear like you would see on smartphones, however it does keep my Kindle Fire from getting dirty from my kids' fingers.  It does the trick, however I wish they made them more clear.  (I know its for anti-glare, but I still get glare).",3,1
"I bought this to charge my spare batteries. The package comes with an extra battery which works well than my original spare. One thing to note, the charger requires your LG AC charger that comes with your phone and it works with the car charger too. Also, the charger will not charge the battery if the battery is completely depleted (it gives a green light indicating full that is misleading). I guess the reason for this is the auto polarity check before it charges the battery and it requires the battery to have a minimal voltage for this to work. All this, I rate it 3 stars - just ok with minor quirks.",3,1
The angle isn't central. Also in the nigth the ligth of back car damage the view.,3,2
"The key case is similar to the original, it works perfectly with my electronic card but whit the security ship, I had a little problem whit the chip, I had to cut a little section to make fit and now it work well. Any problem.",3,1
"The wires are too short. The foot for the monitor is stiff and cannot be aligned with the curves in the car, so it is hard to mount solid. Except for that it is OK",3,1
"I brought two of these, which I am glad I did.  One worked and other cable end seem damaged or something and did not fit in the iphone.  I didn't bother shipping it back or anything, I figure I had all the other pieces and I really only needed one in the first place.  I gave it a 3 start just to say it was ok, not great.",3,2
"This offers perfect protection for my Sony X-series player.  Perfect fit.  They really cut it up nice and neatly.  But it is pretty expensive for one sheet.  I'm sure you can get a bigger sheet for cheaper price with some alterations on your part.  However, if you're lazy like me, then you have to cough up the dough for this product.  I usually only protect the screen because if it's scratched up, you basically have a useless product.  The case and stuff is pointless because you ruin a nice-looking device with such protection.",3,1
Great concept.  Not particularly reliable. I have a second one to be used as a hot-swap when the original needs to go back to the manufacturer for repairs.,3,1
"You get what you pay for. Mine came with no instructions. Got info browsing the net. From there I was able to get started. Charge time is about four hours. Its sucks when I am at work. I don't work with computers so I can charge it. Overall, its a okay product for the money.",3,2
"Since I got the iPod touch as soon as it came out, this was the only hard shell iPod touch cover that was on Amazon at the time. This is actually one of the cheaper cases, and I had no choice but to go ahead and buy it. DO NOT MAKE THIS MISTAKE. One problem that case makers have had with the fifth generation iPod touch is that the iPod touch loop makes it hard for the bottom right corner of the iPod to be fully protected, and with this case, they sacrificed functionality for safety, and that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Another problem is that this is a scratch and fingerprint magnet. sure, its nice that you can see the iPod right through, but because of that fact, it easily scratches the clear plastic. make your decision wisely.",3,1
"This product is OK, if you want a good value for your money alternative to other expensive MP3 transmitters. But, for the price, I doubt this product will last a long time.",3,1
"Perfect for mounting on the *back* of a vehicle--i.e. with the threaded stalk *parallel* to the ground.  Picture is decent.  Haven't decided whether I like the guide lines yet, but I have the (reversible) option to get rid of them.  EDIT: unfortunately the nut that came with this is slightly oversize and wants to cross-thread on the stem.  I can improvise a solution, but I wish I didn't have to.",3,1
"Threads are coming out of it, but still a solid product.  Keeps my ipod nice and dry.  And you put your iPod in upside down with the headphone jack on the top.  But hey, you get what you pay for...",3,1
Works good at first and then music keeps stopping have to reconnect every 15 minutes.,3,1
Works ok for a small room. It's a tiny speaker that fits in your palm so don't expect big volume. My biggest complaint is the extremely slow charging with the included USB cable. I mean...extremely slow! I left it connected to my computer through an afternoon and overnight and it still was only about 2/3 charged. There is no wall adapter for charging either. I don't expect that I'll keep it very long based on that.,3,1
You have to really make sure that you find a good radio station... Otherwise it is very static-y. Arrived on time.,3,1
"I used this product for about two months before noticing that dirt was trapped between the case and the iPod which slowly but surely scratched the paint worse than I possibly could've done myself. I'm still giving it three stars though because there's a really good chance it was my fault. There were also a few instances where I dropped it and although the case would break apart, it did protect from the initial blow.",3,1
"It works fine but the image isn't so clear as expected, to be able to see a tag on the video you have to get pretty close of the car ahead. I have a problem trying to download the videos to the computer, it looks like the PC USB does not have voltage/amps enough to power on the camera. To download the videos to my PC i have to use a SD Card Reader. It's usable, but don't expect much. You get what you pay.",3,1
"Served the purpose to hold my GPS, but too bulky to fit in my purse.",3,1
could not get to load as many songs as it said it should about 380 songs would load. tried several times to reformat said it would load all 600 songs but each time it would only load 380 a little disappointing because I was giving as a gift and to give all the songs I had to purchase two mp players to load them all.,3,2
sence you sent that to me the plug to charge e it did not good at all e,3,1
The overall dimensions make it bulkier than it needs to be.  There is no access to the power button or volume buttons.,3,1
2/5 ordered were faulty. When they do work though the sound is very good for a tiny unit. I found best to leave the equalizer flat.,3,1
Would have been perfect but the white turns after awhile.  If you are like me you like your whites to stay white or on to the next one.,3,1
My daughter loves it,3,1
Good and bright bit not as brought as advertised. Probably only 100 lumens and within 3 uses the inside unscrewed and I had to take it apart and fix it. Over all great product for the money but description needs to be changed to reflect the truth.,3,1
"First of all, if you couldn't already tell by appearance, it's a Chinese iPod shuffle knockoff. That being said, it's a decent enough little product. Most computers are going to have issues with the mp3 player, so you're going to have to find another way to put music onto the micro SD. Also, I don't know if this happens to other people, but when I try to skip a song it plays twice. But that's more of an annoyance to me than a true issue. I've had it for about two months and given that it was pretty cheap, it's a decent mp3. Just don't expect iPod quality for the price.",3,2
"It does look a lot like an otterbox when it's on, but it doesn't have the protective screen, and the rubber never wants to stay completely on the plastic. I wouldn't recommend it for protection, but it's definitely cute. Also, I got the white and immediately after I had it in my pocket, the case turned blue. :( But of course, it's better than nothing. Always protect your phones people! I dropped mine with this case on and cracked the screen. But if I hadn't had the case on it might've been worse.",3,2
"I really like how loud the sound is. Unfortunately, within the first month, a piece that holds the stand broke off.",3,2
not bad buttons are rough,3,2
I had my ipod for a year and never bought a case because never seemed to like them i was searching on amazon and found this nice colors made by shades. I got one and my ipod has semi starches and it looks like new and the orange is just lovely.,3,1
"When I first got it, it was really good. I loved the way the case felt. But then the sides snapped and the back \\""button\\"" (the part that holds the two pieces together) broke, so basically I only have the blue part on my iPod. It's a good case, but it's not really sturdy...",3,2
"the product is ok, I did not like to much the way of attach the wacth to your wrist. bu it is ok.",3,2
Okay,3,1
"I realize for price I wasn't going to get a cadillac but, there are a few disappointing things!  1 instructions hard to read(small print) and difficult to understand.  2 no where does it tell you approx. how long battery (fully charged will last)3  this little gadget has no way of alerting you when low battery occurs? Sadly once battery dies no memory as to how far you've traveled.  ,IF it had some kind of warning signal at least you could see how far you've gone before it erases itself.",3,2
I recently bought this product and everything was good except the stupid wall/car chargers that didn't work. I had to email amazon so they could send chargers that actually work.,3,2
I have always loved this brand. I actually have a satellite set of speakers from them that I bought over 10 years ago. The Ambiance has very good sound and I love the Pandora connection as I wake up to it every morning. Easy to setup. Not the best features for bedroom alarm clock as there is no battery backup!  And the dimmer for the clock does not dim well enough to have at your bedside. I have to put a cloth over it at night.  And customer service has dropped.  I had to send two emails and 1 phone call before I got a response to a question.,3,1
"The one thing I noticed with this cord is that it's very finicky on the connection and sometimes it produces noticeable static in the sound.  If you push where it connects to the iPod you can sometimes get rid of the static.  It seems to be the connection on the iPod end and not the end that goes into the car jack.  But when it works, it works well.",3,2
"I bought this tv because it was cheap and the right size I was looking for. It was fairly easy to install although I did deviate from the standard installation. I secured 1\\"" x 2\\"" pieces of wood to the steel roof using JB weld after cutting out the ceiling. I then secured the tv mounting bracket to the wood and finally the I secured the tv to the mounting bracket. It made for a very secure mount. The TV has very low quality sound (if it is dead silent in the car you can hear it, but just barely). The video quality is not great either much more grainy than regular televisions. I don't understand why you can't buy a quality tv for a vehicle this size from a name brand manufacturer. Come on, LCD's and LED's are fairly cheap now especially at only 11 inches and with no tv tuner or many of the other features on the flat screens now-a-days a price of $100 to $200 for a decent to good quality tv should be very realistic. I continue to use it and the kids don't mind the grainy video and we use an fm transmitter for the sound. Installation is definitely not for the unexperienced, so unless you have some understanding of electronics and cars, you probably will want to have unit professionally installed.",3,1
Image quality during daytime is good but night is super grainy. For the price its a great option though.,3,1
You can't charge the iPod while it is in the case just an FYI,3,2
this thing has great wires but the connectors all sucked still worth the money,3,1
"Received immediately within 2 days Prime shipping.<br /><br />I'm pleased with the light output and it attaches to the Nook case (not the Nook, it will fall off).<br /><br />Frustrated that when I opened the battery enclosure to put in the 3 AAA batteries that were not included that it broke and I had to use tape in order for it to remain closed.<br /><br />Bought an Energizer light as well and it is of nicer quality for the extra $1-2 and comes with the battery...and did not break!",3,2
"works OK, does not work well with AM stations.",3,1
"I was initially excited to find an attractive, hardback case/cover for my iPod; one that wouldn't require me to remove it from the case to manipulate the buttons or plugins. When I received it, I was pleased with the look, heft, snug fit and apparent protection, but then... The clasp needed to be bent to the proper angle to stay shut - not a problem. Plugging it in while still in the case is quite a snug (and sometimes improper) fit - annoyance, but not a big deal. Can't reach the tab to lock or unlock it while still in the case - bigger problem. Ultimately, these issues resulted in not using it anyway. I guess I have to find something else now since I don't want to continue without a protective case for long... It was a good idea (I bought two!), but this particular product is not recommended by this user.",3,2
"I think they probably made 6 billion of these things back in 1992, and they've been sitting in a warehouse losing their adhesive properties ever since.  Gets decent reception, though.",3,1
The screen is too reflective. Only buy this if you've no other choices on price.,3,2
"Not as loud and clear as expected.  Should have returned them, but to much of a hassle!!!!!",3,2
"I purchased this solar powered charger for my husbands car because he no longer has a live lighter outlet in his car and needed to power his Blue Ant speakerphone. I set it up so all he had to do was get in his car and if a call came in he could answer it. This system was perfect for about 4 - 6 weeks. Then I noticed that the solar panel had separated from the casing. I live in Miami and I guess that the Florida sun was too much for the charger. Maybe it wasn't meant to be left in the car for extended periods of time. It did work for a short period of time, but not long enough for my purposes.",3,2
As expected.,3,1
"Great case, I love the flexi-case. But I expected a Royal blue. It's more of a light baby blue. But over all, for less than $5 it's worth it. I order from Eforcity all of the time, they always have great prices and great fast service.",3,1
Have not used lately due to tv audio out of remote speaker not in synch with lip movement on screen.,3,2
Battery capacity is almost nonexistent after 5 months,3,1
This is a fair product.,3,1
"There were no reviews for these batteries when I bought mine so even though I haven't made a full analysis of it yet I'm going to put down a few impressions that I can update later.    The first thing I notice with this battery is there is some odd behavior with my Sprint Hero. The battery icon sometimes changes to something I don't recall seeing before, a gray battery with an exclamation point. There is nothing in the Notifications screen to tell me what this means but I'm wondering if there are periodic issues recognizing the battery. I've only been using it for about 24 hours but my impression right now is it's not holding as much of a charge as my OEM battery, but it's not horrible. For the price, I'd say if you want an extra to carry with on long trips but it's not mission critical, this isn't a bad way to go. I just got mine so I could listen to more music on long bike trips and it will be fine for that but don't count on it for emergencies.",3,2
Quality good. Price is higher than it should for being made in China.,3,1
"I have had this for a long time.  It is a good cover and better than the Sony original style in that you can prop the thing in place.  The worst thing about it is it is open on top and just like the cup of coffee gag, if you check your watch for the time you can dump the reader out.  (I hate to admit it but I did this onto a cement garage floor.  Grateful that Sony has made a tough reader...",3,1
"Cover worked good at first but the tablet over heated while it was in the cover. I took the tablet out and after a short while, it worked just fine. I didn't use the cover for much longer after that, the cover I had didnt hold a charge and some of the keys didn't work. I returned it without any issues.. I thought the design was good and it felt / looked like a great product, maybe I just got a bad one.",3,2
Cable does not slot well into some hard cases (ex: Armor by Otterbox)...had to trim edges of outer cable plastic to fit.,3,2
The day i got my item i took it out of the package and the little velcro strap busted when i tried to close it! Other than that it was fine.,3,2
I was looking for a device that can transmit audio from my television to my bluetooth headphones. The info in the title and description was very misleading.,3,2
"This is a cool cover for the ipod 4G, however, you have to remove it in order to charge the ipod, seems a bit strange.",3,1
work well. have had no issues yet. have owned for 2 months. good pricing. I have used them on ipod,3,1
I got it thinking it would cover the whole back of my Nook 1st edition but it did not. It left about a 2 inch border around the edge. I wanted something that covered all the white so it would not get dirty. It is already peeling away from the edges. I even cleaned the back before applying.,3,2
This cover is sturdy and does the job but I do not like the fact the clasp is on the back.  I am always trying to open it like a book which puts the Nook upside down and on the wrong side.,3,1
"I ordered two of the anti-glare covers for the Kindle fire. I could never get the bubbles out. Even with the bubbles, it was usable.",3,2
"does not fit units as advertised, had to modify it for my unit even though it specified it was for my unit.",3,2
"I already love this stereo so far, however I have to laugh a little when I read that the price for a used one is higher that the price for a new one Ha Ha... Funny....",3,1
sound quality does not overcome road noise.,3,2
"This audio adapter is a great way to connect your iPod/iPhone to your car stereo. However, it has two shortcomings: First and foremost it doesn't work with the iPhone 4S. I have used it since my 3G through my iPhone 4. Once I upgraded to the 4S, it no longer works (still works with my old iPhone 3G and 4). My theory on this is that the automatic switch in the Alpine unit for some reason does not detect when the 4S is plugged in. Repeat all other models of iPhone/iPod work fine except iPhone 4S.   Second issue is minor, but worth mentioning: the plug adapter for the phone/ipod is too big to use when a bumper case is on the phone. Case must be removed before plug can be inserted into iPhone.  Overall, I loved using this adapter to listen to tunes in my car. I pretty much stopped listening to the radio and/or CDs since I can play podcasts, Pandora and my entire music library on my iPhone. I have since got another model of audio adapter with a manual switch and my iPhone 4S works fine. I would give this 5 stars if it worked with the 4S.",3,1
I got this item today and hooked it up in my car.  I used my phone to stream a radio program and the sound just came out of one (1) speaker.  The description says stereo.  This is not producing Stereo sound.,3,2
It works just fine we got it for our rv,3,1
"really good price if you consider having four rubber cases plus a screen protector. The screen protector's really easy to apply and free of bubbles. Tough the case is a bit difficult to put on. But if you think of it another way, it won't fall off as easy either. Honestly speaking though, four cases' a little too much considering it's too much work to change the cover everyday and the cases are pretty durable.",3,1
Looks great projecting onto the window but instructions are very hard to understand and my vehicle will not show it responding to the vehicle when I hit the gas.,3,1
Good basic game is all. Only gin rummy no other games. Had to download it 3 diffrent times was getting errors. The online trouble shooting did not work think the company went under. Overall my Mom plays it alot so good luck,3,2
Person I gave it to says it picks up too much background sounds an there is a buzzing noise that is annoying,3,2
The USB cable did not work. The ipod was a gift and I believe it is working.,3,2
"So i give 5 stars for the case itself - it's great: protects my kindle well, it won't slip out or anything like that, and doesn't actually clip into my kindle at all (the generic amazon case i had caused my kindle to crack and i had to get it replaced)<br /><br />Two problems though (minor as they are)<br /><br />1.  I'm disappointed with the colour. The pebbled cream is more of an off grey than a pure cream that it appears to be in the product pictures<br /><br />2. M-edge doesn't ship outside the US, so i had to buy directly from the m-edge guys, and standard shipping wasn't an option. So although i got my case within a few days (a feat living way out in the middle of nowhere in Australia) it was a little pricey and an inconvenience not being able to buy through amazon<br /><br />Overall fantastic case though",3,1
This radio has many great things going for it but it had one fatal flaw.<br /><br />Great things:<br /><br />1.  Great looking.  Large color display is awesome.<br />2.  Good ergonomics.  Feels good in the hand.  Nice buttons.<br />3.  Battery life is decent.<br />4.  Good adjacent signal rejection.<br /><br />OK things:<br />1.  Decent but not outstanding audio.<br /><br />Fatal flaw:<br /><br />1.  The receiver &#34;clips&#34; the audio if strongly modulated signals are being received.  I encountered this problem when listening to local repeaters.  This is very annoying to listen to as some strong signals &#34;cut out&#34; intermittently.  I found some discussion of this problem among other KG-UV8D users on the web. It was speculated that the problem may have been introduced with the latest bios version.,3,1
"At the beginning great smell, but in a few days it lost..",3,1
"I bought this head from a retail store just yesterday and I'm impressed with the overall quality of this product.<br /><br />Installation:<br />If you know what you're doing with car stereo installation, I would imagine this is a breeze.  This is the first time I've ever actually had to work with the wiring elements of a stereo unit, so it was a wonderful learning experience.  If you're not comfortable playing with wires (particularly splicing), I would highly recommend having this unit professionally installed.  I personally had to use the wire harness that I had purchased to install my last car stereo with and splice the wires from it into the wires that connected to the head.<br /><br />I installed this in my '97 Pontiac Sunfire with very few complications.  The only big issue I ran into in my install is that the deck doesn't fit completely into the dash area on my car - I'm not sure whether this is human error or not, though: A professional installation could probably fix many of the issues I had.  For anyone who isn't familiar with Sunfire structure, it's very difficult to work with radio installation unless you first remove half the innards of your car, all while in an upside-down bat position.  There is no \\""mounting strap\\"" in my car (unless it was included in the packaging of the radio, in which I had no knowledge or method of actually getting the mounting strap up inside the rear radio area), so my stereo is currently just sitting very snugly inside the radio slot.  I may take my car to a best-buy or somewhere to see if they can do something better with it.<br /><br />Features:<br />I am thoroughly impressed with this unit!  It's definitely an eye-catcher, particularly since the bright blue light from the face panel makes it stand out a lot.  Having the faceplate in the open position is very nice - the LCD screen is relatively simple, easy to understand and read.  There's no flashy animation every time you turn on the screen and there are no visualizations for your music or anything else, but you get the information you need without having to search too hard for it on the screen.  If you want to keep any drinks in your cup holder, though, you will want to keep the panel in the closed position.  The open position takes up some space in more compact vehicles.<br /><br />The radio is a pretty standard AM/FM radio.  It has very clear reception, aided by the ability to switch between Distance and Local reception strengths.  Recording Presets is very easily done in a few different ways - you can have the radio automatically store presets for you by holding in the AS/PS button, or you can individually store presets by simply pushing down on the number you want to store your preset in for a second or two.  You can also have the radio scan through your presets, stopping at each one for about five seconds or so until you decide you want to listen to a particular station.  I could go into more detail, but the user's manual is pretty clear about the different functions (I've read a few reviews who felt the manual was rather cryptic, so perhaps there has been a reprinting), and besides, most AM/FM radios do basically the same things.<br /><br />I do not have XM radio, so I can't really say anything one way or the other about this particular feature, but I think it's pretty awesome that it's XM ready with very little work involved to put an XM receiver in your vehicle.<br /><br />Sound:<br />I'm still using stock speakers in my car - the sound coming out of this head unit is great!  Crystal clear sound, great balance all across the spectrum of highs, lows, and mids.  The loud function works very well to make your sound pop, and the EQ settings are good.  I particularly like the \\""Beat\\"" setting, as it seems to make things sound the best to my ears.

I rated at 3 stars because the batteries would not last as they should. When I attempted to charge they would not charge with the original equipment charger. Since they were not usable I was refunded for the purchase. I was told I need not return the batteries. I was going to put them in the battery disposal box. I had noticed there was a missing contact and decided to break open the case to see how they are put together. I found the contact that was missing is the negative end of the battery string. After providing that contact to the HT the batteries charge and seem to work properly.,3,2

"-2 Missing the display port :( I've been having software conflicts and crashes trying to use a blu-ray player on a few movies and took it out until I can figure out why, if I ever will without help. I didn't care for the flimsy plastic guard, which I couldn't see anyway. But it was nice and quiet with my first build, though hardly a gaming computer as yet. I was going to upgrade to a UHD monitor, but without the display port on the card or not having a DVI dual link port on most of the UHD or most new monitors,  I bought another 32 inch TV for now instead.",3,1

"I received the Nike+ sport band as a gift and was really excited when I read its features. Unfortunately it did not live up to the hype. When I used the sport band the first time, the calibration was very inaccurate. The sport band said that a half of a mile was .20 miles. I was frustrated, as the instructions said it was already calibrated and should work right out of the box. When I tried to calibrate it, it said there were no runs eligible to calibrate.It said this no matter how fast or far i ran. When I got a new sport band, it worked great right out of the box, and I was very satisfied. I did not have Nike ready shoes so I had to buy a pouch for the sensor, and it fit very well with my shoelaces and did not add on any noticeable extra weight. Overall, once I had my calibration issues sorted out, I really enjoyed the sport band and I would recommend it to any of my friends.",3,1

"I've bought this item to be a second player. I have a Iomega Screenplay Pro in the home theater and wanted to have something to watch video files in bedroom. One of the \\""must have\\"" items I was looking for was the ability to play SRT subtitles.  It does play the subtitles, but they are white, too thin (depending on the background color they get completely unreadable). The player also doesn't recognize accented words and mess up the entire text. This was easily solved by running a \\""text cleaner\\"" macro, but the color and thinness on the subtitle should be fixed, maybe using a firmware update.",3,2
Just what I was looking for.The only problem is that it doesn't fit the iPod Touch 5  snuggly. A little loose but still useable. Would have liked it in black too.,3,1
"I purchased this for my 11 year old daughter for christmas, I purchased because of all the good reviews on the website.  We had a friend load 4 cd's on to the player for her, they said it was almost full after just 4 cds.  We can't figure out the video and there are no instructions on how it works either.  Overall, for the price she really likes it, and will like it better once we figure out how to work everything.",3,1
"I bought one of these and sent it back for replacement. The first cable was defective. It would connect fine but would not allow the personalized settings to be changed. I kept the software unchanged for the replacement cable, and this second time it worked - kind of.<br /><br />However this second cable was also defective. I noticed the light on the cable wasn't working initially so I had to hold the cable tightly in the USB port with my hand. (Switching USB ports did not help.) Then the Techstream would not connect to the car. I had to hold the USB plug in tightly AND hold it a bit to the side. It finally worked. I had to keep my hand on the plug throughout the process.<br /><br />Bottom line is that these cables must be made extremely cheaply. If you buy one and it does not work, send it back and get another. You'll see all kinds of posts on internet forums where people are having errors or problems making it work. I'm convinced that it's a matter of poor quality quality control on the cables.<br /><br />When it works, it works well.<br /><br />UPDATE - Bought a third cable of the same type/brand.  Have used it with exactly the same laptop and software as the other two. This one works fine.",3,2

"Worked great for awhile...Bought 2 in December.  Neither of the charging cords ever worked, but the device itself worked great, both playing music and phone calls.  And then my device started intermittently disconnecting from the stereo.  The last time it did so a few months ago, it took forever and a ton of setting searches, as well as deleting the device from my phone and refinding it several times.  It took several days to finally get it to successfully reconnect but when it did it now has to have the connection button pressed at least twice to connect.  Then this morning, it wouldnt connect at all even tho the light on the device indicated the music was connected and playing...finally i pulled the device out of my lighter socket (i did NOT twist it, I just pulled it out like i have a thousand times) and the whole base that sits in the connector came out and was loose down in my lighter socket causing extreme sparking, smoking and a horrid burnt smell.  Not only is the fuse from the device blackened, I am sure i will now have to replace the car lighter fuse.  Seems incredibly dangerous for that to happen!!!  I will be sending it back today for replacement and im hoping ill get the same great service I got for the 1st 6 months...and that my husband is continuing to get with his.",3,2
"The backside film has multiple edges to accommodate for the buttons, the front edge fits perfectly on the screen. But it doesn't do much.

"Works fine, but has its quirks.  A couple of things we've discovered so far:  1. The \\""MODE\\"" toggle is also a pushbutton.  It's called the \\""MENU\\"" button in the manual.  Press it to select the mode that you want from the menu.  \\""MSC\\"" is music mode.  2. For us, the battery was a bit loose and caused the player to turn off if it was squeezed a certain way or dropped.  Solution was to place a small piece of foil on the positive battery terminal.  This provided a better connection.  (Note that sticking foil in an electronic device is dangerous in so many ways.  Don't try it yourself.)  As with many of these players, it's too big to fit into a USB port with little clearance around it.  Front panel and laptop USB ports should work fine.  Worst case, a USB extension can be used.  Update 12/4/2011: The headphones broke within a couple of days, they are very fragile.  Had to drop another five bucks on new ones.  Then we discovered that it cannot handle rechargeable (NiMH) batteries.  Alkaline or better are required.  (Rechargeable batteries put out a lower voltage, so the device has to be designed to handle them.)  Since it was becoming less useful (we need it to handle rechargeables), I went ahead and pulled on the positive battery spring contact until it stuck out a bit, and that did make the power more reliable.  (Again, not recommended as it may damage the unit.)  I have a Coby 1GB mp3 player that has worked fine for years.  Handles NiMH batteries with no problem.  Headphones did break but only after a year or two.  We're going to try a newer Coby to replace this.  Update 12/23/2011: We got the [[ASIN:B0035P4C06 Coby 4 GB Video MP3 Player with FM Radio (Black)]] to replace this, and it works perfectly.  Costs almost twice as much, but worth it if you want to go rechargeable.",3,1
Range is not as good as claimed. Volume needs to be louder. Fully charged batteries last a long time.  EDIT- These walkie talkies are pretty much junk now. May be battery-related but I don't want to spend more money on them.,3,2
"[[VIDEOID:d85db8ea16b9264f6ac916e4a4df538d]] * I received a unit for review and want to emphasize that all opinions expressed on this review are solely mine and not influenced by third party members in any way<br /><br />This is a generic copy of an old ipod model that came out a couple of years ago. I wanted to like this MP4 player because of its affordability and the fact that that it has a radio function but apart from that, everything else about it is sub par. After filming this video, I pressed down on the LCD screen and I realized that the screen is EXTREMELY cheap and flimsy. The screen would bend to my finger press and give a clicking sound. This unit, though it initially works well, is not made to last at all. The most you can possibly get out of this is about three months and that is at its most. I recommend looking elsewhere for other mp3 players that give a better quality.",3,1
"This item is not designed for an IPod Touch. When placing your IPod in the holder the correct way, there is no way to plug in your headset. There is a slot in the bottom of the case, but it will only allow you to charge the IPod, not listen to it. I find myself taking my IPod and just sticking it in the case upside down to deal with this, it just tweaks me that it doesn't work as advertized. On the other hand if you have a IPhone, with the headphone jack on the top of the device, this would probably work perfectly for your needs. One last gripe about this band that can also be worked around is that it doesn't fit big arms too well, I have to wear it on my forearm. I did still give this armband at least three stars because it is made well, my IPod fits firmly, and sweat gets no where near it when I run.",3,1
"1st unit DOA. 2nd unit worked fine. There's not a lot to say about this, you're buying it because you have a Toyota and you most likely want to change some of the customizable options on your vehicle without visiting a dealer or you want to examine and clear codes - it does that. Three stars because the first unit was dead out of the box; that makes me wonder how long it will last... This will be far easier to use with a PC running a 32bit version of Windows - I have seen reports of people getting it to work under 64bit Windows but I did not have great success. It works fine in Parallels.",3,1
"Here are the pros and cons as I see it:    Pro: This is pretty comfy to wear on my bicep. Mind you, I'm pretty skinny. If you have muscles like Ahnold used to, you may want to try it out in person before you buy.  Pro: You can see the Pod through the shield.    Con: While I can see the Pod, I can't really read the Pod through the shield - particularly outside in sunlight.  Con: It's not an adjustable band, so if you have large arms it may not be so comfy for you.  Con: Using it with the Nike sport kit is kind of a mixed bag. The band has to stretch a lot to fit over the plug in the bottom of the Pod, and once it's stretched over that, it doesn't snap back so well. To the extent that it doesn't hold the Pod in place nicely without the plug.",3,1

The only way to get it to play again is to unplug the unit from my phone, replug it in and then restart the recording. Very frustrating. Since the Bible app works fine when not connected via this cable to my car stereo, it seems to me the issue is with the cord.",3,1
"It's very difficult to find a cassette player, and cd player with mp3 and best yet with a remote...Sony's own web site does not offer this model (out of country only) so if your looking for all of the above this is it....but sound quality not so much...the remote doesn't get you to specific cd tracks..and on pause it will not hold the exact portion of the cd only the chapter but I use it strictly for the kitchen (inside a cabinet garage) to listen to books on tape while cooking etc. so sound quality is not of the greatest importance. I replaced an older sony model with this unit and if the other model played mp3's I would have gotten the same model again as the sound quality was better and the remote worked  better as well. If you don't need to play cassettes there are other much smaller units that sound better and play all types of discs...but this is about the best you will find that does it all at this time.",3,2

"I really like this for my Nook Color but I have two issues.  First the pockets on the left side are way too tight and do not fit anything, so I took out the threading and I use it that way.  Second if you use the elastics to hold the top part of the Nook the left side constantly turns on your Nook and it will stay on all day and kill your battery.  And the right side elastic plays with the volume button.  I still like it but if you do not use the elastics on top the Nook will not stay in place.  So right now I am keeping only the right side elastic on because I don't like to reach for my Nook to read and find out its battery is dead.",3,2

Pausing the song and then turning it back, makes it work for another minute, and that's it, it's like there is a buffer and it fills up very quickly and then the device is unable to keep up. I am not sure it is a faulty device, or a faulty line (model). Aux works great though, but using the cable only is not what this speaker was bought for.<br />And by the way, the device had some dings, even if new in the box (box was undamaged), I think it came from manufacturing.",3,2

Also doesn't come with a manual, just a quick-start booklet, and haven't had much success getting help over the phone.  On the plus side, I love the feel, the size and the fact that I don't need a stylus.  Also my battery seems to last a good 8+ hours before a recharge is needed.",3,1

The item shipped on December 2nd and the anticipated delivery was December 7th.     On December 9th I called the vendor to ask where my product was and was told they were not sure and sometimes that happens.  I told them I needed the items by Friday and asked if they would overnight.  They told me no that they only shipped USPS and did not do overnights.  They said they would ship 2 day so I would have Friday morning.      I received the items on the Monday after my party and they look like they were returns from other people.  Not in boxes, wrapped in bubble wrap, etc.    I did recieve the first shipment and they were not wrapped in bubble wrap!      Very disappointed in the customer service department.  Didn't seem to care about the customer.  The comment was made to me that they had reached their part of the agreement because they had shipped on time, but in the same breath made comments that they had had problems with USPS previously.",3,1

I can't put it in the cradle and charge it at the same time unless I turn it upside down, which is weird.  I like that the sides clamp onto the phone but they're too low for the charging port.  That's the reason I gave it three stars, otherwise it's exactly what I wanted.",3,1
Super happy with the quality of these cables. Price is good for the pair. Hoping they stay working. The other ones I bought from another company worked for about a month then said accessory not supported. Fingers crossed with these. So far so good and the part that I dislike about apple cables is they separate from the pins and break all the time. These seem more secure in that area! ..... Update. A month later and they are intermittently working. It will show the icon for charging but won't nessecarily charge. The one plugged into a charger works still but the one plugged into my computer is hit or miss now.,3,2

A little help from a friend for the soldering and some super glue and everything is perfect.<br /><br />Given the size and price of these I would encourage anyone to consider this simple mod.  Of course it would be nice if this was already taken into consideration and they shipped this way, but oh well.",3,1

"The headphones are somewhat large and cover your ears well. They appear to be bulky when wearing them which doesn't bother me too much. The headset comes with a fairly long cable that must be plugged in to your television or your console. A volume controller is attached to the cable closer to the headset end and in order for the microphone to work another cable must be plugged from the volume controller to the game controller. Since I use an HDMI cable for my console I have no other choice than to plug in the headphones into the stereo out of my television. Because of this I am able to watch the television with it muted and the audio sent through the headphones which is an added convenience considering I am usually the first person awake in my household and I don't have to worry about waking up others with the television noise. The sound quality is good enough and they can get plenty loud. This you have to be careful about because you can easily blow out a speaker which cause a horrible crackling noise to emit from them, deeming them practically useless. And here is where my problem was. I only owned the headset for a month or two before I noticed this crackling sound coming from the right earpiece. I was a little unhappy about that but I contacted Turtle Beach through there website and was able to send in the faulty headset for a new one. Shipping cost me roughly $10 which I thought should have been covered by them. Instead of this headset costing $39.99 it actually cost $49.99 and I was forced to deal with the inconvenience of being without a working headset for a while.<br /><br />So in summation, it's a decent yet sometimes faulty product with decent sound. Combine that with an unsavory return policy and you get a three star rating.",3,2
"It took forever to come to my house, when it did, I plugged it in and it worked! It was easy to upload music to the player from my Windows computer. Following morning, I went to gym and when i got their, the radio option on my player wasnt working. It was expected with a cheap player. The music on it works fine but the back clip sucks, and will probably break on you, just like the headphones did after the first day of swimming. The headphones dont fit well and fall off when you swim, so i ordered new pair of headphones. For the price your paying the mp3 is decent, just know you have to spend another 20-40$ on some new headphones.",3,1

"As a buyer of well-over 300 Baofeng radios (and counting) for the group I belong to (not all of which were purchased through Amazon but many were), I'm always amazed at the lengths some sellers go to to hype their products as being \\""newer\\"" or \\""better\\"" than other models, or perhaps (to give them the benefit of the doubt) they just don't know any better.<br /><br />First, the Baofeng UV-5R series (including the original and still extremely popular UV-5R, I'll explain why in a minute) is what is normally referred to by many as a SDR radio (or software defined radio).  While not a true SDR product (you can't use it with your computer to control the radio's functions or scan a wide amount of VHF/UHF frequencies with it), none the less a large chip is programmed on the circuit board built inside each radio.  That chip determines what capability the radio itself can perform.<br /><br />Every UV-5R series radio has the ability to transmit from 136-174 MHz on VHF and from 400-520 MHz on UHF in both narrow-band and wide-band modes (very useful for the occasional FRS or MURS use, which requires narrow-band mode to work correctly).<br /><br />Every model does \\""at least\\"" 4W on VHF/UHF from the factory, but occasionally you'll get a batch that does 4.5W or even 5W out, but the difference between 4W and 5W is minimal at best.  A 4W radio with a better antenna will easily outperform a 5W radio with the standard crappy antenna that Baofeng ships on ALL (including the UV-5RA, -5RAX, and -5RAX+) models.<br /><br />Baofeng DOES NOT program those chips any differently for the UV-5R vs. any other UV-5R series (including the UV-5RA).  Version 307 of the firmware (which is the most current release I have in any of my radios) works EXACTLY the same way as previous older releases of firmware at least back to the 295 release (over a year ago), so any claim from a seller that this release provides additional features (at least from a user's perspective) is simply BOGUS, since the firmware inside both radios have the same features.  In fact, my UV-5R radios with the 307 firmware release is EXACTLY the same radio (inside and within the firmware) as my UV-5RA radios with the 307 firmware release.<br /><br />Second, you CANNOT in any way upgrade the firmware (unless you count buying a different radio and it comes with a different firmware release), so again the claim in the listing from some sellers that you can is simply BOGUS.<br /><br />Third, you can believe that two thinner pieces (glued or screwed together on the faceplate of the UV-5RA) is somehow stronger than one thicker piece of plastic (on the original UV-5R series) if you like (and maybe it is), but I haven't seen that in real-world use from my own UV-5RA units.  The standard UV-5R units that we use seem to hold up just as well (when dropped in the desert dirt or rolling down a hill) as any other Baofeng radio we own and use.<br /><br />Fourth, and my biggest issue with all of the non-standard UV-5RA, UV-5RAX and UV-5RAX+ units, is that NONE of the Baofeng battery accessories (except the little 1800 mAh standard battery) work WITHOUT modification (unless you use a Dremel tool to grind or cut off part of your extended battery that works on the standard UV-5R - but won't work on your UV-5RA, UV-5RAX or UV-5RAX+).<br /><br />Getting new UV-5RA units that don't work with Extended 3800 mAh batteries (without modification) doesn't make my group happy.  That may not bother you, but NONE of the sellers of the non-standard UV-5RA, UV-5RAX, and UV-5RAX+ units ever seem to mention that lack of hardware compatibility in their listings, so buyer beware!<br /><br />BTW, NONE of the \\""AA\\"" or \\""AAA\\"" battery shell packs work on the UV-5RA, UV-5RAX, or UV-5RAX+ units either, so that's 3 different battery accessories (including the 3800 mAh extended battery) that you can't use on these radios without hacking them with a Dremel tool (but they all work without modification on the original UV-5R units).<br /><br />So \\""if\\"" you want a \\""pretty\\"" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (or -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.  Oh, you should see how well that shiny faceplate lights up when a flashlight hits it in the dark, just the thing you don't want for night use.<br /><br />Virtually every guy in our group ends up carrying a standard UV-5R and giving the UV-5RA, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ to the wife or kids, since the wife and/or kids rarely care about the other accessories working and they (the wife and kids) tend to like the \\""pretty\\"" radios, but again there is NO INTERNAL difference and NO EXTRA FEATURES in the UV-5RA, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ units (other than a different looking shiny faceplate) vs. the original and still wildly popular UV-5R (which I refer to as the M16 of radios, as all the accessories you match it up with just plain work).<br /><br />Now you know the real background on these radios.f\\"" you want a \\""pretty\\"" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (or -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.

Well this flimsy piece of plastic does its job to cover the edge around my head unit but does not fit very well.  The tabs on the side do not fit flush with the side of my head unit.  It does not come with screws and the tabs come off VERY easily.  I had to glue them on to keep them from falling off during installation.  I was not able to even screw the tabs to the side of my unit due to having to use the factory brackets.  So I ended up having to put a couple drops of glue around the edge of my head unit and laying this on there to hold it on until I could get the unit installed.  It looks good when its installed but honestly its a cheap piece of crap as the picture shows.,3,2
It works. Except not for my phone because I have a Lifeproof case on it and it won't fit. So the rest of my family can use it on their i-stuff.,3,1
"The products in this package are a great deal, however the the subs themselves cannot hit the low/very low bass notes. The hit more of the medium to high side bass notes. The amp has tuning capabilities, but don't seem to help much. These are in an enclosed box to exactly manufacture specs. Rap/hip-hop has acceptable results, however rock/metal is not great, as the bass drum sounds like its not even on the track. This is my 5th stereo/sub install and has the least favorable results IMO",3,1
Even though I loved the colors these chargers are not charging my ipod all that well I guess thats what I get for looking at it as being so pretty.,3,1
"Ok so I have only offically tried one out of the two i ordered, but I'm unhappy to report that the one of the side to the one that I tried don't charge anything. :( but other side does a Okay job for the most part. It sometimes a lil choppy.",3,2
"At first I thought that this was a pretty cool case.  It isn't made of silicone, so it slides into your pocket easily.  However, when my itouch 4 came, the case fit very loosely around the itouch.  Therefore, I had to readjust the case every time I took it out of my pocket.  I would reccomment getting a hard plastic case instead.",3,2
"I bought a two pack. One of them quit working at just over a month, outside of the return window",3,2
"Don't buy these speakers if you plan to use outside.  Although they claim to have a removable, rustproof mesh grill, all 4 of the speakers I purchased rusted in less than 3 months.  When I called the company to ask how to remove the grills so I could try painting them, they told me the mesh grills are glued in.  These speaker grills are neither RUSTPROOF nor removable and they look ugly on my otherwise beautiful deck.",3,2
"The picture of this item makes it appear much bluer than it actually is. It's only slightly light blue, not this pretty intense turquoise shown. The cover does stay on securely and does its job much better than the black rubber floppy case I was previously using, though. Still worth the few bucks I paid for it.",3,1
"This is the second Airdock I've bought. I decided to give this one a try after reading reviews saying it worked with the iPod Touch 4g.  The first was an older model that was completely incompatible; ended up giving it to a friend.     This one is at least partly compatible. You have to remove the insert to dock the Touch properly, and while sound playback is okay, video playback doesn't work at all. It'll play the sound for the video just fine, but the image displays only on the iPod, and sideways at that. So it's good for charging and listening to music, but not for watching videos- which unfortunately was the main reason I bought it. After rereading the reviews, I noticed none of the ones mentioning the 4g said anything about video playback. Wish I'd noticed that before.    One funny thing- the \\""PowerBlock\\"" AC adapter included with the Airdock actually costs more to purchase separately than with this dock. So I guess I got one good thing out of it.",3,2
"After lots of looking on Amazon, I saw this case for my 3rd gen 64gb touch, and the price was too good to pass up.  Now that I have it, I still think it's a good deal for the price, but you can tell that it's not a case that would be sold in the Apple store.  While it looks & feels nice, there are little things about it that belie it being a more expensive case.    First, the Pros:  - the price  - color -- it's not vibrant & obnoxious, but a very subtle mauve  - nice leather feel on both the inside & outside  - sync & headphone ports are easily accessible in the case  - small profile -- doesn't take up much space    Cons:  - case partially covers on/off button at top of case  - magnetic closure -- I read that it can be risky to have a magnet near an ipod, but this one seems weak so I don't think the case's magnet will damage my iPod.  Still, I would prefer a snap closure.  Additionally, because this magnet is hidden in the case material, the case does not seem to close securely/precisely.  - the magnetic snap is on the BACK of the case.  While it's not a big deal, it's a poor, non-intuitive design since most cases/purses (of ANY type) have the closure on the front.  You have to train yourself to open it the correct side or else your iPod will be open upside down.    Other things that I wish this case had, but won't really gripe about since it IS an inexpensive case:  - wrist strap  - a pocket on the inside of the case to hold a screen cleaning cloth or earphones    All in all, if you're looking to just protect your iPod for very cheaply, buy it.  If you're going to be annoyed by poor design or don't want magnets near your iPod, keep looking.",3,2
"I ordered this because I wanted  a leather cover for my Nook Tablet for a<br />better price than I could find at Barnes & Noble store. This fits the bill, but you get what you pay for. The leather is hard and stiff unlike the softer leather I have seen for a higher price. Also, the strap that holds the Nook in place covers up the on/off switch making it awkward to get to.",3,1
"I ordered this without there being a clear description of what the item exactly was, so now that I have it I feel obligated to \\""report in\\"" on what I received.    I bought the orange one, which is a very thin plastic shell that the iPad snaps into and then the smart cover closes over the top of it. The thin plastic shell is white with a fabric-y orange oddly shaped textured piece on the bottom. I couldn't tell from the photos that there was a tight plastic shell and I was wondering now the orange X shaped thing was going to attach. Turns out the orange thing is attached to the shell. There are cutouts on the shell so every button is accessible. The cover is not exactly like the poly cover that Apple sells, but it's close.     There is an included screen cover/protector that you attach separately. I'm familiar with the application of these film covers since I have had them on phones and laptops before. The one that comes with this product is cheapo and practically sucks dust and grime out of the air and under the cover when applying it. I have never seen something attract non-existent debris like this. I was on a dust free area with nothing but the iPad and the cover, yet after carefully applying there are unremoveable dust bubbles under the protector. Fortunately I didn't buy this for the screen protector, but it does mean I have to go buy another one if I want one that's not riddled with debris under it. Really an inferior screen protector.     All in all, I'm happy with my selection. I'm the kind of person who will purchase several covers over the life of the ipad so I'm sure I'll replace this before long. However it's got me covered all the way around and my brand new baby isn't going to get scuffed!",3,2
I have this unit and I cannot get the video to work. Even with the included amv converter it still says invalid file. Can anyone help with this? Otherwise a nice mp3 player,3,1
There are no instructions for installation.  I had to figure it out by looking at the pictures here.  It gets warm but not really nice and toasty.,3,1

The mic quality is not that great. You have to leave it above your clothes and speak directly into the mic for people to hear you otherwise they will hear a muffled noise.,3,2
"This didn't work because the silicone skin was too small for the screen protector. The screen protector kept popping out and I was baffled that it didn't fit. I kept it though because I liked the clear screen protector (the iPod Touch case I was using had a cloudy one that bugged me). It also came with a nice cleaning cloth.  In addition, it was inexpensive enough that I didn't feel I had lost anything.",3,2

"Gotta love Monster Cable; this wire is BIG. The only problem is that is does not fit into any of the 1/0 gauge connectors or fittings without some extra work. I drilled out the fittings, rather than trim the wire.    3.5 stars because of incompatibility with standard 1/0 fittings.",3,1
the actual modulator-transmitter works great...no problems at all. my issue is with the remote. my remote only worked for the first 20 minutes i had it!...(enter super pissed face here). i even went as far to buy a new battery for the remote thinking it may have sat around for a while and the battery it came with just died...not a big deal right....wrong! it still didn't work with a battery change. that was a major factor in buying this model because a lot of other models i saw did not come with a remote. at this point i just don't even feel like sending it back...but it is a definite bummer for a major feature not to work when its brand new!,3,2
"Positives:  1. Attractive clear, bubble pattern case.  2. Slim; doesn't add too much to the overall size/volume of your ipod touch.  It's almost like the ipod does not have a case on.  3. The bubble pattern that is stamped on the inside is relatively smooth and so, it does not scratch/mark the back of the ipod.  I've had an iLuv TPU case whose pattern made marks on the back that I had to rub off.  Negatives:  1. The case edges that surround the ipod does not go much pass the glass top, so you will not be able to put the the ipod face-down on a table without the glass touching it.  I don't do this intentionally, but accidents can happen.  2. The volume buttons are hard to press through the case material.  The power button is not as hard to use through the case material.  3. Does not come with a screen protector.  Updated review on 10/11/2011 (and lowered rating by 1 star):  Negative:  4. The clear plastic has turned light yellow in color after less than a year of use.  5. The sides of this case does not grip the body tightly, so it allows dust to easily go to the back of the ipod.",3,2
Have been unable to sink it to my iPhone with the bluetooth.  Radio and CD functions are fine.  Sound quality is good.,3,1

"Works mostly as expected. I mainly use it as a link between my ear muffs with aux and my phone. It works fairly well if I keep both on the same side of my body, but the signal gets broken intermittently when I move my arm between the devices. Not sure if this goes for all BT-devices, but I didn't expect that kind of problem in a distance of less than 1 meter. Other than that, a very practical device for car, headphones etc.",3,1
"This is a very convinent device but there is NO way to read the included instructions.  It says it is a plug and play device but, the instructions seem to have some information on them.  I cannot locate anything on the internet.  Also, it does seem to run fairly hot.",3,2
"This is an average product at a premium price (when shipping is factored in).  I selected this brand because I prefer a front screen protector that has a separate cut out for the camera, as opposed to the single elongated oval cut out on many other brands.  However, the cut out hole for the camera is way too large, in my opinion, and looks akward.  Based on overall quality and fit and finish, I recommend the PhoneDevil product.",3,1
"it was really pretty but not sturdy, my kobo fell off a chair with it closed and the book ended broke...should be warned",3,2
"Received in the beginning of May, and used these cables constantly with no problem. However, by July, they started to stop working (had to giggle the cord to get my phone charged, plugging and replugging, etc.), and then eventually they didn't work at all. It would be great to find a charging cord that lasted more than a few months!",3,2
"This player arrived in about a week, I took advantage of the free shipping, and so I had to be patient. I purchased this to replace a dying I-pod for my daughter. The packaging was quite impressive but the instruction sheet was lacking in detail and obviously from a Chinese manufacture, poorly written and not very helpful.      The player looks nice but is light and cheap feeling in a plastic sort of way, of course what should one expect for the low price. The touch screen is clunky and not responsive even when set for the greatest sensitivity. The navigational controls are adequate, nothing too impressive. I-tunes doesn't recognize the player as expected, but Windows Media Player does. You can simply plug the player into a PC and drag and drop audio and photo files, could also use to transfer data files. I am not sure about creating and using play lists at this point. The FM radio is pretty cool as an option, and there's a built in microphone so you could use this device to record audio, something not offered with an I-pod.      The 8 gigs of storage space is incredible for this price point. For whatever reason you have to \\""reset\\"" the player occasionally as it will freeze or hang like a windows based PC on a busy day. Keep a paperclip or other instrument with a pointed tip handy to press the reset button. My teenager is pretty rough on players but has managed to get a minimum of 10 hours of play time out of the unit between charges. It has been dropped without damage and the screen seems to be durable. You can snap pictures with this unit, not sure about video.    For the price (I paid about $70.00 including shipping) I would recommend this unit, comes with a decent pair of earphones and is small in size but has a nice large viewable screen. If you want an I-touch then don't expect this to satisfy your gadget appetite, your wallet will thank you for this purchase though.",3,1
Unfortunately the sound level is not much more than that of a macbook but its easy to set up and easily portable,3,1
"I bought this item because my coworker had it and loved it.  I used it for the first week on the same radio station with no problems. Then all of a sudden it stopped transmitting music from my iphone through the radio. I had to constantly search for radio stations that would work, until recently it didn't work at all. After not using the transmitter for a couple of days It started working again. The charger it self has to be pushed in constantly because it is constantly pushing its way out. Otherwise it's great when it works.",3,2
"This rubber case protected my iphone perfectly, The negative point it was after constant use the 30 pin cover and phone jack cocer tear down. Also the light and proximity sensors didnt work very well due to this transparent rubber covering them, after I cut the problem was solved.",3,1
It doesn't make separate playlists.,3,2
"The price is low and sound is surprisingly good; close to a CD dare I say it (with a little background noise but you won't even notice it). However, that is where the positives end. Build quality is cheap and feels like it could break if you are too rough with it. You're gonna have to take it out and handle it gently like you would a kitten or any other Chinese made product. The same can be said about the little remote that comes with it. It works best if you use an SD card or USB flash drive. Plugging in your MP3 player or cell phone through the audio jack gives off the worst quality sound. I used the audio jack provided but the quality is so bad, it sounds like an awful remix rather than the original song. It might just be my transmitter, but I'll give it another go with a different jack. For some reason songs with heavy bass like \\""Ghosts 'N Stuff\\"" by Deadmau5 might sound bad so you'll have to test songs if they work with the transmitter, a problem if you have over a hundred songs. If you have a USB to audio jack like the ones provided for an iPod Shuffle, it won't work. Music does not resume where you left off when you leave, but that doesn't really bother me. If your cigarette lighter/car charger is directly in front and/or is close to your gearstick it could get in the way, especially if you are going to use a flash drive. Make sure you have good clearance before deciding to buy. Extra fuses are also provided which I found weird. It feels to me like they are saying \\""the fuse might break one day, so here are some extra ones so you can fix it yourself (sucker).\\""<br /><br />If you are tired of changing and burning CDs all the time, this is not so bad. If you don't mind relying on the SD card or flash drive than the audio jack if it doesn't work well, this could work for you. I would make sure that whoever you buy it from has a good return policy in the event it breaks.<br /><br />Would I recommend it? I paid around $10 USD for it and I give that much to homeless people sometimes, so give it a try and return if you don't like it.",3,1

I bought this product because I was tired of using multiple remote controls it works great lots of features lots and lots of options I used it for maybe a month but then I quit using it because it just wasn't fun anymore and it really wasn't the fun factor the plug-in dongle that you have to use an plug-in to the charging port of your phone is just awkward and too bulky especially if you use a protective case then it sticks out even farther so then you have to use a dongle adapter/extender it just is in the way it's too big and too bulky this big old black thing sticking out of the end of your phone!! if you don't mind that then yes it's worth buying! but over time I just got tired of basically looking at it hanging out-of-the end of my phone Great product poorly executed if they come up with hey smaller adapter for the end of your phone then yes I will buy another one and probably use it but for now it just sits in my drawer with the rest of my junk,3,2

Simply put; if you try to text or use the internet while you are listening to music, the music begins to cut out. We use this for our stereo outside for parties and I cant go too far without this cutting out. I usually put it on the table only a few feet away so our music is not interrupted. More then ten feet is risky. I was really looking for something I could walk around the yard, grill, play yard games with my phone in my pocket, you cant do that with this product. If you are looking for something bluetooth from ten feet away, this will work.",3,2

I was looking for an armband for my nano but couldn't find one in town anywhere. I ordered this one on Amazon because it looked like the best strap which did end up being a good feature but the part that holds the iPod is not a perfect fit.

"I purchased this to use specifically with the Lifeproof iPhone case as it is recommended by the manufacturer. While it fits, the fit is not ideal. The little door on the case, even when wide open, pushes somewhat on the extender. This makes it difficult to put in place and difficult to remove. It works, it's just not an ideal fit and makes using it cumbersome. Additionally, it does not appear to be solidly made and I don't believe it will last a long time....",3,2

"Generally, you get what you pay for and I kind of knew it going in. I needed a cheap replacement MP3 player. I have my iPhone, but it's nice to have something smaller that I don't mind nearly as much if it gets damaged or lost.<br /><br />Overall it's okay. Two key things to note 1) the headphone jack is not your standard size headphones. Headphones are usually the first parts to break and I'd care more but I have a few old cell phone headsets that fit. 2) I've had a couple of issues with the memory on this thing already. I add files and they don't appear in the directory but the memory shows up as in use. I reformatted and re-copied the files and it seemed okay, but I think it's a glitch in the firmware and in any case it's annoying.<br /><br />But shipping was quick and generally speaking the device works fine. It's nice to keep my audiobooks on and smaller/lighter than my iPhone and the built-in rechargeable battery has soo far held up nicely",3,1
"I like this skin.  Very pretty/cute.  The reason it only gets 3 stars is because the edges on the back, where the nook is curved, don't seem to stay stuck down all the way.

(and yes I did clean BIG TIME on my Kindle) So needless to say either I kept it on or take it off....I took it off because it was in the middle of the screen protector. So I got 1 for the price of 2! I do like the protector but I am upset that I paid for two and only was able to use one. I wish this happened to cell phones protector because then I would not care, but the Kindle, that is something you can not have a hair on the screen with a bubble.",3,2

"I purchased this meter because it was so inexpensive.  I had watched a video review of several meters like this and the &#34;GT Power RC 130a High Precision Watt Meter&#34; tested well compared to the others in its' price range.<br />Pros -<br />The price is right... about $24.<br />It measures current and voltage with a fairly small margin of error. (see Cons below)<br /><br />Cons -<br />The back light is on all the time.  This is either a plus for you or a minus.  I would like the option of turning it off to save power.<br />Seems to measure current that is 1 amp or more just fine but if you want to see the vampire current... no dice.  Mine will not show 80ma, it reads zero.  So the AH is not being updated.<br />Bulkier than many other meters. It is 2/10 thicker and 4/10&#34; longer than the Watt's Up meter.<br /><br />Summary -<br />The GT Power meter is functional but it isn't very accurate at low current levels.<br /><br />How to fix it -<br />Add a switch for the back light.<br />Add an internal battery and a reset switch<br />Make it read low current levels like the Watt's UP meter.<br />Keep the price reasonable.<br /><br />My 2 cents worth.",3,2
"DO NOT FOLLOW THE PRODUCT DIRECTIONS before reading this translation guide:  In the battery insertion directions \\""Take out the circuit board inside\\"" means leave the circuit board alone.  There is no reason for it to come out.  In fact, there is no reason to put a battery in the new transmitter at all because it comes with a battery.  \\""Unscrew the fixed nail\\"" means unscrew the phillips screw.  A jeweller's screwdriver works well.  \\""kids under 3 year-old should use that under wardship of paterfamilies\\"" means this company isn't responsible if your kid eats it.  \\""unfasten the antenna and put it straight when using\\"" means don't unfasten the antenna or it won't work.  You can't straighten it because it is in a loop.  Range will be longer if you don't touch it and keep the the loop from crossing.  There are other creative uses of English but you can probably figure them out.  The transmitter sends out a different code each time it is turned on.  The receiver learns that code and continues to look for it.  That means if you are using search function and turn the transmitter off to save the battery until you start looking for the object with the receiver on it, it won't work because the receiver is looking for the old code.  Once the receiver and transmitter are turned on they both need to stay on until they are turned off.  There is a little wheel on the receiver to adjust range.  There seems to be not much correlation between wheel position and range.  The receiver beeps a few times when it acquires the transmitter's code, then is quiet until you move away from it in antilost mode or move close to it in search mode.  The frequency of beeping varies for no apparent reason.  I give it three stars because I think it will perform its function but it may be a little erratic and it took three of us to figure it out.  I think there is a U.S. law that products made in foreign countries have to have country of origin on the product or packaging.  This one doesn't, although the HongKong return address on the shipping envelope is a clue that it is of foreign origin.",3,2

The problem is that after 9 months, with one use a week, one of the sides has gone dead.  Of course, with any earbuds, the wires are tiny and probably subject to breaking inside the insulation.  Or maybe they broke at the bud.  Dunno.  I will likely buy another pair but I wish these had lasted a while longer.  I thought I'd found the right thing.",3,2
"Okay, here's the update, people: I had connected the parts incorrectly the last time I had given a review on this product hence the spin action I was speaking of while the case is attached to your bicep; THAT IS NO LONGER TRUE!!! It does not spin at all! You have to tighten the round cap around the screw on the inside of the clip. Through stress of whatever is it your are doing while utilizing the clip, the cap's grip will loosen around the screw that protrudes from the case, but not extremely so, and it takes a while for that action to take affect.    About the noise-canceling button that is on the top-right of the player (and completely covered by the case), you can slide your index finger under the case's material to turn the noise-canceling button on or off. The material is very manipulative, yet rubbery enough to return to it's original state without blemish.    On to the plastic clip: the the plastic material that creates the clip is actually pretty sturdy. Although, by first glance it does not look sturdy at all, nor feels like it; quite deceitful. The MP3 player stays in place while riding my mountain bike, so no complaints there.    All in all, this product is worth it considering how cheap it is all together.  I've never had a Sony case for my MP3 player, but if you do not wish to pay $20 for an authentic one then, this is the one for you.    Sumac's not too shabby - Good job, Sumac!",3,1
"I bought this for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 7&#34;. The fit is perfect. The color is a soft pink, though there appears to be batch variations. As the one purchased for a friend was a bit more of an intense pink. The two horizontal angles are good for TV watching. The vertical angles are best for when the device is resting on a table. The cardboard used in the construction seems to be flimsy. It's a shame, because the overall design, versatility, a look are above average for me.<br />I especially liked that the set included a screen protector, pen, and folio cover. When applying the screen protector, clean the screen really well and mist the screen with a little water. Similar to how ArmorSuit is applied. This will help to reduce bubbles. When applying the screen protector, clean the screen. I am not sure I would make the same purchase again, but I will not return it.

"I did a lot of searching on different forums and blogs before I purchased. Dashcamtalk . com has quite an extensive review of these cameras. What I've learned is there is no easy way to know what you're buying. My gripe with this camera is the descriptions are wrong.<br />- It does not record H.264. It records MJPEG in an .AVI  file format.<br />- MJPEG is much less efficient at video compression<br />- It does not include an HDMI cable.<br />- The box it comes in claims it's H.264 and it isn't.<br />- The camera doesn't work well with Class 10 MicroSD cards.<br />- It's not 1080 resolution. Closer to 720<br /><br />I use a Mac. AVI isn't an ideal format for a Mac. I am able to play the files using the QuickTime player in Mac OS 10.8.2.<br /><br />I decided to keep it. It's intended to catch an accident. So I don't care about long recording times. I first bought a 16GB Class 10 card. It worked, but the video was mostly blocking artifacts and noise. The camera would stop recording at times. Unusable this way. I found an older 8GB class 6 card and it worked much better. I still get the occasional garbled frames, but it's much less frequent. 8GB will hold about an hour of video. Plenty for my needs.<br /><br />The image quality is quite good. License plates are readable when you are behind someone at a traffic stop. The field of view is very wide. Colors look good and it handles going in and out of sunlight well. Night capture is ok. It sees roughly what I do. The 2 LEDs can be turned on but are of no use. I put black tape over them so I don't accidentally blind myself at night. Their light just reflects off the windshield. The suction cup mount is very good and holds on to the glass quite well. The camera is a little bigger than a business card and about 3/4&#34; thick, I have mine almost hidden behind my rear view mirror.<br /><br />The menus are simple. Not too hard to navigate. The camera powers on and starts recording when it receives power. It stops the recording and turns off when it loses power. There is a lock button which when pressed with write lock the file currently being recorded. So if you want to save an even just press the button and the file won't be overwritten when it's time to recycle the files. Your file sizes are 1, 2, or 3 minutes long.

"One of the reasons I ordered this was because it has the elastic straps in the corners to hold my Kindle securely inside.  Well it is WAY to big for a Kindle.  I tried my own Kindle and my husband's which is a little bigger than mine and the case is still way too big.  I think this case would fit an IPAD instead.  So my Kindle just slides around in the case.  But it does protect it from damage.  It is thick enough to provide a worry free carry.  I do like the zipper pocket on the outside.  It is plenty big enough to carry the charger cord and my loose change and most everything I carry in my wallet so if I am going somewhere and want to take my Kindle but not my whole purse, I use it as a purse, Kindle case, etc.  It is really big though.  About as big as a daily planner (the 3-ring type with address book etc.)",3,1

Its a very good sounding amp. I bought this amp and installed in my 2001 Honda. I connected it with 2 jl audio subs and if you turn it up the thermal turns on a little. The light turns red when the bass hits. I don't know if its because the subs were too big or the amp was not getting enough power. Buy even then it still sounded good. Might be better for a single sub since its 2 ohms.,3,1
Fits my nook perfectly. The speaker is covered up a little so I shoved a piece of cardboard back there to help hear my speaker better.,3,1
"Overall this is an OK MP3 player. It plays FM and is also a voice recorder. For the price it is good. It does not play video, but that's OK; this isn't a top of the line player. My biggest complaint: It does not have a setup guide. The box tells you to go to Sandisk.com to download one, but I couldn't find one nor did I get a response from their customer service department. I finally found one when I googled for one. But again, this is a pretty basic player so overall it was easy to figure out anyway; I was downloading songs before I downloaded the setup guide so it's not that complicated. The only thing that I am having real difficulty with is that it layers the track of a 2-disc CD (Beatles' White Album). So instead of playing CD1 Tracks 1-17, then CD2 Tracks 1-13, it plays CD1 Track 1, CD2 Track 1, CD1 Track 2, CD2 Track 2, etc. And of course, this is not addressed in the setup guide, Sandisk refuses to contact me and I've deleted and downloaded the discs several times now, together and separately. But you get what you paid for and I paid [...] bucks for this thing. If I paid more money and got a better MP3 player, I would have better results. It also comes with a strange armband that is either loose over forearm or tight on upper arm (perhaps a belt clip would have been preferable); earbuds that keep falling out of my ears (I'm using headphones that fit the jack and they work fine); and a USB cable. But it's a small player that holds some albums, several songs and plays FM radio, which is all I wanted. Overall, it's an OK MP3 player.<br /><br />Edit your post:<br /><br />Note that this is July 7, 2009, I've had the player almost 2 months and it is now dead. I tried downloading music and it said it was full. I took off some albums I didn't want to make room and it would not download anymore although it said it had plenty of room. Windows Media Player said to reset. I tried to find a reset, but couldn't. This went on for a couple of weeks. Remember, I had to download a guide from the website because this did not come with one. WMP suggested I remove all files and try again. I debated after a couple of weeks, but finally did so. It erased all my albums (except for one. Strange.) and would not let me add anything or reset. I figured out that since I can't find reset on the player or in the manual that, surprise, it has not reset feature. So I have an MP3 player that has lots of room and will not let me add MP3s on it. I was a little hesitant about getting this one at first, but now I am convinced:<br /><br />DO NOT GET THIS PLAYER!!!

"Based on the photos alone, I thought this was going to be thicker and provide better protection for the phone. The skin is very thin and will protect only against scratches. The phone is very smooth and slick and can easily shoot out of your hand without the skin. I thought the skin might provide more grip--give a more rubberized feel to the phone. But, alas, it is just as slick as the original. Nice design and it is certainly better than nothing, but not a permanent solution.",3,1

I do like the product itself... I use it everyday when I swim... There are just two things... The headphones lost full connection in one ear within two weeks... It plays very faint in one ear but I have bought new headphones for it... One thing about how it plays the music...  There is no random play... It puts the music in numerical order but will play it in the exact order that you transferred it on to the device... one way around that is to put it all on the mp3 player then remove everything and save it on your computer and then transfer it back... then at least it plays it numerically... would be ideal for audio books....,3,2

"Subwoofers are desirable, even addicting because they greatly improve the sound of music but they are also not without their problems! My first setup used balanced output from my Apogee Duet 2 audio interface connected to my MBP to the SBX10 with my BX8 speakers connected to the SBX10 as recommended by the instructions.  This sounded great but when no music was playing there was a noticeable whine coming from the BX8s (the subwoofer was totally quiet). The whine is not present when the Duet is connected directly to the BX8s without an SBX10. I suspect the whine is caused by a strange interaction between the Duet 2 and the SBX10.  I contacted M-audio support (more on that below) and Apogee support and both suggested there was a ground loop problem even though the whine was evident when the power for the Duet was coming only from the USB connection to the MBP which was running on batteries. This morning, with great effort (you would not believe the rats nest of cables I have to deal with) I setup the speakers and the Duet 2 with its external power supply which I don't usually need to use, all on the same power strip. The whine was still there...  I should note this was not a 60 cycle hum but a much higher frequency.<br /><br />Fortunately, I found an acceptable bypass by connecting everything through a Yamaha mixer and in that configuration the sound is clean as a whistle and I am able to have a PC with a Sound Blaster card, the MBP (via the Duet with balanced cable), an old Sony CD player and the TV all running through the mixer. The only down side to this arrangement is when playing CDs in the CD player I have to adjust the volume at the mixer, but I think that is better than using the built in CD players in the PC and MBP because they make mechanical noise and require the computers to be running.<br /><br />One last thing, I have found it desirable to turn the SBX10 sound off when watching normal TV programs such as the news. That's because everything, particularlyads, now has back ground music with previously unnoticed base that becomes very annoying when amplified by the SBX10. If I watch a movie on HBO or PBS, I will use the SBX10 because it adds dimension to the sound track, but not for normal TV with ads that are constantly yelling at you.  Fortunately the SBX10 has that foot peddle that disconnects the sound from the SBX10 while allowing the audio to be sent through to the BX8s.<br /><br />With regard to M-Audio, I am not at all impressed with the support I've gotten. M-Audio is now owned by Avid.  I registered the SBX10 but never received an acknowledgment email from them. Furthermore I have found that if you want to get tech support from them you need an Avid Support Code (ASC) which they will happily sell to you... Sheesh, you have to pay for warranty support?  Supposedly when you register a product you get some complimentary ASCs in the acknowledgment email but of course I didn't receive that email (and yes, I checked the my gmail spam folder). That really annoyed me, so after registering for the 3rd time I noticed a support number you can call if you have problems registering. I called it and the guy on the other end said you don't even get ASCs with their studio monitors! OMG, I have to pay to contact tech support for a brand new and rather expensive product under warranty! That's not what I call good customer service. I told the guy about my problem and he suggested it might be a ground loop. He also promised to send me an email acknowledging my registration which, of course, never arrived either. I'll be calling him again today to tell him what I think of their tech support and that I will almost certainly never buy another Avid product. I deduct one star lack of support and one more for the whine problem.",3,2

"The GTMax White Rainbow Butterfly Print Hard Snap cover case was beautiful!  However, this cover case was bought Sept. 2011 and it is now 10/19/11 and the case is broken.  I'm very disappointed!",3,2
"This radio does everything I want it to. I can set it to record a show and listen to it later. The rewind live radio is ok but it should function better considering it also has a auto recording function where it will just record your favorite channels in the background. But rewind live radio only rewinds the channel at the point you started listening. Also I wish I could go from recorded audio to live and back again without losing my place but alas, I can not. The software seems a bit slow to respond. Changing the channel is slow.",3,2
Great deal!,3,1
"The actual microphone and speaker portion worked great. Sound came through clear enough for communications and the microphone didn't garble tranmissions. My only quip is that the connection between the headset and the plug for the radio has very fragile pins. Use care if the wires will be plugged and unplugged frequently. Other than that solid, affordable headset.  Would have easily been a 4 or 5 star product if the connectors weren't so easily broken.",3,1
"I got this cover for my Ipod Touch because it looked really awesome in the picture, but when I got it and put it on; well let's just say it's not as great as I thought. The case closes around the Ipod, but leaves gaps around the edges. A fall on hard ground will most likely cause the case to re-open. I thought about testing it, but it wasn't worth the risks. Overall though it still is a decent hard case for the price. Would I recommend it to a friend to buy, probably not. I will however be looking for a new case that fits and closes better (if possible perfectly).",3,1
"I really like the color of this case. My only complaint is that the edges near the top are a little rough.  There are openings on the top and bottom, and along the side; so pushing the buttons or charging is no problem at all.  It does come with a sturdy screen protector.  Perhaps I just did a poor job, but there are several bubbles under the screen protector that I can't seem to get rid of.  This was a great, cheap cover that will protect my itouch.  But I will probably switch to a higher quality case in the near future.",3,1
"These are a little too stiff, and do not fit comfortably or stay in my ear. They also tend to pop off of the headset easily.",3,2
"It's very nice my kid loves the artwork, but the plastic makes it very delicate. Looks like it would break once you drop it.",3,1
"This product was the exact size that I needed, however only one speaker works when I play the radio. Both speakers are fine with I'm playing CDs.But for the price I paid, I did not expect perfection. The volume is good.",3,1
"Bought this for my cell phone and laptop when I was going on a family road trip coast to coast.   PROS:  It works. It doesn't overheat. Looks okay, and makes a solid connection.  CONS:  Was NOT able to power to its specifications. Although, this may be due to my Prius' outlets.   It could charge a laptop when it was off, but it was UNABLE to charge and power a laptop that was on.   It could handle my friend's netbook [ON and CHARGING], my smartphone [ON and CHARGING], and another smartphone [ON and CHARGING] via a USB splitter.   Cost; for its quality and abilities, I'd only pay about $15 for this.   I've had this item for 4 months and it still works just like the day I bought it. I've even dropped it 4 times.",3,1
trouble attaching to Kinldle. Had trouble getting the air bubbles out. The item was priced fairly but attaching it was the only problem,3,1
Sound quality is a little fuzzy. It has a good response to audio input. The LED lights stay fixed on. Would like color changes and intensity to match audio input. I still have given consideration to purchasing additional units to make a bank of them.,3,1
"Sound quality is great, hangs well in my shower, easy to use. Only issue, is it runs out of battery within one use! Meaning, after one normal 10 min shower when I try to use it on the next occasion its out of battery! Curious if I'm doing something wrong as all the other reviews for this product have been great.",3,1
"I was looking for a bluetooth device, not a plug in speaker, which is what this speaker is.  It's a nicely-styled little unit, though.",3,1
"First off, the case itself is fairly durable and fits snuggly to the player.  Yeah, that's just the case.  If you've been sold over on the extras, hold it right there.  Secondly, it doesn't ship with the 3 piece LCD screen protectors, just the main screen shield that is supported in the two top corners and opens from the bottom.  The stand is more than flimsy, I've already taken it off after one day of use, and the armband doesn't look trusty.    The case does what it does, and it's relatively cheap, but the screen could use better protection from something safer than the protector given, and the other two accessories aren't anything special, nor useful.",3,1
"Brought this suction-cup mount to replace the OEM mount with a dead rubber suction-cup.  Suction cup portion works great, but mount length is too short & prevents Garmin GPS unit antenna from unfolding properly. I cut off the plastic mounting sphere from this mount & bonded (using JB Weld) the longer mounting length from the OEM mount.  This allows enough mount length for the GPS antenna for unfold properly.  It's not sleek looking, but it functions fine now.  Also, I  trimmed a little rubber surrounding the female connector on the 12V cord (at the GPS interface), to allow the female connector to seat flush with the mating male connector surface.",3,1
"I don't think these are leather.  They don't feel or smell like it.  That magnetic flap snapped right down the middle and leather wouldn't do that.  I peeled it back and it looks like plastic.  However, it's cheap and does the job.  I have had this thing for years and I'd get another.",3,1
"I installed this with the kenwood sirius receiver, and an RB1 head unit.  This part works, but does not allow the station or song name to be sent to the head unit.  It uses the CD changer input on the head unit which means you move up and down cd track numbers to get to the different sirius stations sequentially, 1-150.",3,2
"My friend expressed his desire to get the Party Animal Dancing Speaker, so I bought it for him as a gift. He really liked it, and thought it was funny to watch the cat dancing, and I thought so too, but it will only dance to loud music. You have to turn the music up to get it to work. After a little while, it's no longer amusing. It's OK, but not great.",3,1
"I put the film on my screen as you should , however the air bubbles never came out . I haven't bothered to do much about it because it stays on okay and protects the screen fine.",3,1
"For the most part, this unit is quite nice. (especially for the price). The only problem I found with this product is that it was advertised as being able to be used with a Backup Camera. (This is why I purchased this unit). The display does have an input jack marked A/V input but, the jack size is too small to fit any of the standard mini A/V plugs. In addition, the manual is very sparse with no mention of the A/V input at all.  Because of the above faults, I have yet to use this product for the purpose that I purchased it.",3,1
Let me say that I have replaced alot of these screens.<br />These screens fit OK and work well.<br />My only complaint would be that they seem to crack easier than the black or white ones.<br />If you dont mind replacing them again in a year or less they will work,3,1
"The wall Charger is ok, but the datacable is too tight for the i phone. It needs much more perfection for a perfect and smooth fit to the i phone.",3,1
"Sound clarity is not what I had hoped for, and since installing this about six months ago it has developed a bit of a feedback/whine, which was not there originally.  I'll probably upgrade before too much longer, but I probably should have opted for something a little higher quality in the first place.  On the upside, it is pretty powerful and the price was good.  I just wish it didn't whine!",3,1
"For the price this camera is exceptional value and if you can tolerate grid lines, a grainy fish-eye picture and indifferent auto-brightness then this is the camera for you. I wish they had integrated a switch or a wire to disable the grid lines. In the end I adapted a camera used on school buses for 10x the price. The IR LEDs are actuated by a light sensitive resistor and you have no control over when the IR kicks-in. However it is adequate to the primary mission of the camera as a reversing aide. Range is maybe 12 feet.<br /><br />Perhaps my only real complaint is the in-circuit resistor which helps steps-down the voltage to the unit - the resistor in encapsulated in plastic on the lead running into the camera. The plastic becomes hot to the touch. Again this demonstrates the cheapness of construction since a more competent unit would incorporate a switching power supply.<br /><br />In the end I integrated a DSP (Digital Signal Processor) to a Sony HD sensor and used this to remove the aspherical distortion of the lens, perform mirroring, and encode to mpeg4. I then used several of these cameras to stitch together a unified 300 degree field-of-view surrounding the car. The mpeg4 information is used to detect moving objects and estimate distance and closing speeds.",3,1
"Right off in purchasing this I knew this wouldn't of ipod quality, but I decided to sacrifice. I want to first say that this company has great customer service, but you'll get a giggle from the engrish they may talk \\""We are aim to please!\\"" type stuff.  <br /> <br />When I first got my mp3 player the screen was cracked as it was mailed in an envelope. I sent it back and they returned it fairly quickly, however had me send it to China. And it wouldn't have mattered since soon after I got the replacement the player slipped out of my hands and landed on a chair from about 2 feet up and cracked the screen again. Not a fatal flaw, but if you wanna watch videos it can be bothersome.  <br /> <br />Features range from really good to crappy. They headphone jack is the mini-phone style so you can't plug in standard headphones. The connector and cord looks pretty flimsy so you have to be careful with it. It comes with an AC charger adaptor though so that is cool. Also it has video, fm radio, recorder, and even tetris. Navigating is a bit hard though because there is no touch pad deal, just buttons. The battery life is about 4ish hours max so it's alright. They provide software to compress videos to a format that the player runs. <br /> <br />All in all I feel it's an ok deal if you are a very casual music/video person. The extra $50 is worth a better mp3 player. I still feel it does it's job and plays music and video alright.",3,1
The user interface is difficult to understand.<br />It is difficult to operate.<br />It is priced right and if you can get by the user interface it works well.,3,1
"I had received my sleeve a few days ago and like stated in other reviews, it is tight, though I hope it looses up like noted.  It adds much more bulk then expected.  Especially if I put the plug in the pouch which creates a buldge on the side.  I'll use this when traveling on a plane but for everyday use I won't be using it like I had hoped.",3,1
my grandson likes it. it's a case you can easily put on and pull off. the quality is good.he  collects different cases.,3,1
"I thought thought it said would fit a Simple Touch Nook, but when I received it, it wasn't the correct size. We made the sticker fit by cutting it to size, but book case was too big. It fits my Nook, but I bought it for my daughters Simple Touch Nook.",3,2
"I chose this my 07 CRV and it was a perfect fit. Only thing to complain is that one of the leds did not work.<br /><br />The picture is good, there is a grid which should help you to see the distances, but I don't know if it is any good.",3,1
"I really wanted to like this speaker deck from Teac.  From a sound perspective, the speakers are great, they are easily the best I've listened to in this price-range/size.  However, I was mostly buying the product for its alarm feature.  To my surprise, the unit does NOT have a snooze button.  For those of us who slam the button to get a couple extra minutes of sleep in the morning, should not buy this product.  In fact the large button in the center you'd think was the snooze is actually the off button. <br /> <br />In summary, if you're looking at the teac purely as a compact speaker option, it's a good buy, but keep away if you need an alarm clock with snooze features. <br />",3,1
I love that it worked for a while and it was cheap. But it wasn't rugged and didn't last long. Hopefully the newer one will last longer.,3,1
"Lets be honest,its cheap.that being said the picture is good,sound is pretty good.face plate is awful.takes forever to load a SD card and never picks up where u leave off so have to ff through 200 songs to get to something different because it always starts at track 1.CDs and DVDs no probs at all.haven't used the USB yet.other than the SD thing and the incredibly cheap and semi functional face plate,(seems like I have to push every button more than once for a response) I can't complain",3,1
"The case is convenient with the magnetic close, you just have to tuck it when you're reading so it doesn't get in the way. The lamp hardly provides any light and is useless. Buy this item for the case but not for the lamp or the transparent screen protector which I eventually gave up on and threw away on the first day.",3,2
It does the job of packing a lot of music. The con is it takes a lot of navigating to get to the one song. Titles are sometime abbreviated because of the small screen.,3,1
"Generally works well and good quality but, inexplicably, sometimes I get the message that it may not be compatible.  Works fine, however, at charging.",3,1
"This case looks great and the idea is good.  However, about 2 weeks after I got it, the clip let go and is now so loose, I wouldn't dare to hang this from my purse or belt loop.  Disappointed.<br /><br />Update:  They tried to do the right thing and sent me a replacement.  Unfortunately, they sent the wrong case.  So...I'll amend to 3 stars.  Best I can do.",3,2
"works okay, should be set up to rotate so cards not in way on either side",3,1
Says red but it is a heck of a lot more pinkish then red.<br /><br />Can't have the newer IPOD too close as it keeps cutting it off. Going to try with the Sirius player next and see how that goes,3,2
"The case protects the ipod.  Now you wouldn't want to drop it.  But it will protect from scratches.  Goes on easily but can sometimes slip off easily, too.",3,1
"Don't expect anything magical here. This thing is cheap, but it achieves the basic goal of a case by protecting your nook should you drop it or put it in a bag with other items.",3,2
"I was a bit disappointed with it, the band rolled a lot, and the inside of it was damp.  Think I'll search for a different one, but it does the job, difficult finding droid stuff.",3,1
"I got it within the time I was told and setting it up in my car to my phone was easy but i didn't really like the sound quality, there was a constant static/feedback type noise that is heard when the music is too loud for the speakers. I don't have any problem when using my aux cord or just listening to the radio normally. Another thing I didn't like is that you have to manually set it up each time you get in the car. It doesn't auto connect. So I just unplugged it and put it away. I guess you get what you pay for!",3,2
Had few peoblems staying connected to do player,3,1
"I like using my Kindle \\""naked\\"" and wanted a cover for use while traveling.  Initially, this cover was a little tight, however, it \\""relaxed\\"" and loosened up after a few uses.  What really peeves me, though, is that the exterior neoprene got dirty very quickly, and I can't get it clean!!  It looks terrible!  Other than this issue, this cover works well and affords excellent protection when the Kindle is being carried in another bag (i.e., a carry-on, large purse, etc.).  I am now shopping for another cover that will offer the same type of protection and can be cleaned easily!!",3,1

"This product could have potential to be perfect, but there are too many flaws. First off, it's somewhat difficult to get these centered perfectly, and unlike what they claim, it can be very difficult to reapply them. Secondly, the back piece doesn't cover NEARLY the entire back. Overall with the price I paid for this, I would say it is worth it. I wanted to ensure that I would keep my new ipod looking like new, so I also bought a hard plastic case for it as well and with both products on my ipod, I feel as though it is pretty safe.",3,1
How do you adjust the volume on this speaker? For the life of me.. I can't figure it out! It's too low for me.,3,2
"One of the beepers kept on beeping, and I can't use that one. Otherwise, it's ok.",3,2
"The customer service with this company is GREAT.   The product on the other hand is a little flimsy, probably a consequence of needing to be light and non bulky for putting in your pocket.   I am not sure how you would solve this problem.",3,1
It's ok. It's slim but it doesn't cover the phone. I'm really scared to drop it. It seems like it only covers half the phone. It looks cool but man I'm screwed if I drop it.,3,1
"it protects the remote good and looks nice, HOWEVER it is very tedious to remove the case and put it back on because it is such a snug fit.",3,1
"Nice leather case that encloses the Nook. It doesn't just snap in like most of the cases I have seen. Just one problem, it is not as pictured, it is upside down. If you place the case with the flap up the Nook is face-down. NOT GOOD.",3,1
I like the clarity of the sound.  It is heavy with all the batteries.  The megaphone  has been very durable.,3,1
"The Ion Tailgater Bluetooth arrived quickly and i was able to set it up.  After turning it on, I was able to immediately use the AM\FM radio and also plug in my iPhones and iPads with the included 3.5mm headphone cable.  I was also able to charge the apple devices with the USB port.  I did not realize until I received it though that the USB port is only for charging and cannot be used to connect devices for playing music.<br /><br />The problem I do have with the unit is the the Bluetooth functionality does not work.  I attempted five different devices and none was able to see the device.  After calling product support at Ion, I was told the only fix would be to ship back to Ion for repair.<br /><br />The unit is still functioning at a level that I can use it for a party.  But will send it back to get repair after as the not having the Bluetooth functionality in a system named 'Tailgater Bluetooth' does not make much sense.",3,2
It was okay but not easily used.,3,2
Great,3,1
"I gave these a 2 as they are ok for the money, but not great. I got them for FPV flying with my quadcopter. Keep in mind I don't use glasses.<br /><br />Initial thoughts: The viewing area is much smaller then expected... Think looking at 13 inch laptop... and that's kinda what it feels like.<br /><br />Quality:<br />The glasses themselves feel well put together, but the battery pack needed to run them feels lower in quality. The case that comes with them is nice and everything fits in it.The colors and video quality are low, but usable.<br /><br />They are ok in overcast, but if you use them in the sun they are not usable. I would suggest Teleporter V3 that are only 199. I now think they are a much better deal. They are 2x the price, but much easier to see in the sun, and are a complete FPV system that comes with (camera, transmitter, and receiver built in)",3,1

"Not sure how people will get motivated to read a review of a plastic GPS mount...but will try.    This fits the GPS and the windscreen/dash mount. It works as designed,.",3,1

"Distorts color of screen, But ladies it is a perfect mirror ! On the run and don't have a mirror? Luckily you have an iPod mirror !!",3,1
"This case is GORGEOUS but it's falling apart. When I'm not using my iPod, I keep it inside an inner pocket in my purse. It has NEVER been dropped, yet the case is breaking. I thought maybe some of the stones would fall off at some point but that hasn't happened. The case itself though is completely cracked apart on one side.",3,2
"While the cable didn't work when plug in my Win 7 laptop (my iPhone 5S didn't recognize the cable as an official Apple accessory), the cable works reasonably well with the USB wall power adapter. However, it might take some trial and error to insert the Lightning just right for my iPhone to &#34;get it.&#34;<br /><br />The construction quality is solid and comparable to (but less polished than) the official Apple product. The cost of production is probably very cheap and the supplier make some good profit by selling oversea. No complain there.<br /><br />Product is made in China and ship from China so it will take a while (but within the promised delivery date). It took exactly 33 days  to deliver after my order had been placed. So be aware and plan ahead.<br /><br />Overall, the product works well (with minor issue mentioned above). I leave a backup cable at work so I don't need to worry about my iPhone battery life. With all things considered, it's a good buy.<br /><br />UPDATE: 03/24/2015<br />The cable finally died today. It has been connected to computer the entire time so the wear and tear factor is minimal. The fact that it became unusable after such short period of time means the product is not reliable (quality is not guaranteed.) At least I still have a second cable for emergency use.",3,1
Its a very helpful product especially if you have a problem with leaning forward in the car ! (has shorts after a month but its ok),3,1
"the band was way to big for my arm! but other than that it was okay, they shipped pretty fast too,",3,1
Do not fit tight.,3,2
"The opening is 5.125&#34;.  There is room to open it to 5.625&#34; diameter.  My 6.5 inch speakers were front mount, so I only needed a 5.5&#34; cutout.  I used a scroll saw and opened them accordingly.  They are well built.  However, they only send 1.  I thought the price would be for a pair.  Why would anyone need 1 speaker box?  It's a lot of money for 1 speaker box.  Also, they sent me 1 black one, and 1 grey and black one.  Apparently they ran out of grey carpeting.  So they don't match.  So they have a color blind person in finishing.  Overall they are well built if you want to spend the money and do some modifications or use smaller speakers.  I would not recommend them to a friend because of the costs and finishing issue.",3,2
Im not too pleased with this one .. It had five stars on it and thats why i got it but its really not a five star stereo .. There are no equalizer option for watching dvds and theres really no way to cut my subs off when i need to .. On top of all that the outputs are not putting very much power out to my subs so it doesnt sound good at all .. I had to go back and hook them up the way i didnt want to just to make em sound good .. ! Video quality is ok thoi guess !,3,1
These types of extension cables are extremely hard to find and I ended up having to buy the same one I bought a couple of years ago for my VW Jetta.  The dock is located way inside my center armrest in the car and a real pain to fit an iphone or ipod in.  The last one broke because you have to squeeze the part that goes into ipod to release and it finally gave away and broke.  I wish it just came off like my iphone charger does.  What I was really looking for was a shorter extender but this was the shortest I could find.  I hope this one lasts longer than the first.,3,2
Difficult to place on car flat. Left too many creases,3,2
The stand up case is awesome! The quality of the leather is very good. keyboard is just ok. It is not ideal for extensive typing but if you hatethe on screen keyboard it is a great alternative.,3,1
"I would have given this Ipod more than 3 starts, except for it did not work for the purpose that I needed it.  It was ordered specifically for use on my 2013 Victory motorcycle.  But it would not work on the motorcycle sound system even after I purchased an adapter (since the outlet did not match the Apple outlet on the motorcycle).  It did arrive timely and was in very good shape (no scratches or anything).  But I had to return it.  The return was very easy and my money was refunded promptly.",3,2
"This was okay for a while, certainly worked as a speaker, but was a little bulky on the ipod so we quit using it, I wouldn't buy again, plus the newer Ipod touch has sound, just buy the newer version of the touch.",3,2
"Received this today..  I received two headphones and transmitters but did not receive the recharging adapter as was described in the description.  But, I had already opened them, thinking the adapter was inside the clamshell.....headphones work as expected, but less than pleased that the description does not completely match what was shipped.  Will soon find out how well Amazon does at customer service and hope they can ship the missing component.  Something else worth noting, the transmitter has a pull out antenna on the back of the device which makes it cumbersome to set on a shelf on the wall so that the power switch is easily accessible.",3,2
"And how does it work... this should not be this hard to figure out. Not gonna lie, kind of frustrated, but whatever.",3,2
I hope i will use this charger for a very long time since it's made in china i doubt it,3,1
This is a good protective case but it is not stable enough to stand up and must use something behind it to hold the galaxy up.,3,2
"Nothing fancy, but it does what it needs to.  Not a dark purple as described (a bit lighter) but color's no big deal. More cheaply made than I'd hoped (not as thick or tough, and it slides around a little) but it fits. The protection it offers (with the side grips too!)isn't much, but it's enough to make me less nervous I'm going to drop and break my iPod! Overall, I can't complain with the price!",3,1
"this product functions the way that I need it to:  it has the 30 pin slot exposed, so I can charge it without taking the iPod nano out of the band.  I can also attach the heart rate monitor transmitter while wearing it.  The actual quality of the band is not so great.  It is a bit too rubbery and flimsy.",3,1
This was ok,3,1
"Nice radio, but it required a million different adapters for everything to function. I am very disappointed with the app radio feature. Works, but is not as smooth as advertised. App radio functionality is limited and spotty, and you must be tethered to that huge cable to get it to work. I bought this unit to get away from the one with the integrated navigation. My thinking was that the iphone navigation would be more up to date and functions well on the phone. Pandora app on it is a joke, when it works. Better off using bluetooth as it works well, and has fewer issues. What was Pioner thinking when they added the mixtrak feature? I could see it on a kids radio but seriously it is a bunch of crap.",3,1
"The product it's self  I give 5 stars***** great product made from heavy duty materials. I love the fact you can do different configurations. It fits my Suzuki intruder great. I had to do a little grinding, but that's not the products fault. The picture shows it being painted, but it says naked steel. It is naked steel, so be prepared to spray paint it. I used a can of truck bed liner from Rustolium and it it looks great. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because it took 15 days to get here. I placed the order on the 19th of one month and finally received it the next month on the 4th. Granted there was a holiday it there, but it said 3-5 days standard shipping. That was a bit frustrating, and it's made in America so it didn't have to get shipped from China. I recommend this product highly, just don't expect to receive it right away.",3,1
"The product came as described, including the lanyard. The silicone case is very soft, and lets me use the scroll wheel just fine. However, the fit is somewhat loose. The left side of my case is very loose. It's like the right side fits my 80 gig iPod classic, but the left side is made to fit the old 30 gig iPod video. Wierd... I will definately purchase a replacement once the major manufacturers start making cases for the iPod classic.",3,1
It works but unfortunately you have to turn it on everytime you get in the car. I wish it would turn on automatically when it gets power from the car being turned on.,3,1

I just received  two Black colors SanDisk Sansa Clip Zip 8 GB MP3 without Manuals. I was disappointed and I hope it will function and play or record well? Because i don't understand why they didn't send it with manual and with its carton or box or package.,3,2
"It collects dust/stuff from your pocket.  It's a little to rubbery. I wish I would have gotten a harder, slippery case.  It you know you want a case like this, get it and you'll enjoy it.",3,1

This cover is a very strong rubber cover. It was much smaller than the Walkman itself but amazingly stretched enough to cover it on all four corners making it an extremely tight fit. It doesn't fit all the openings and controls as well as it could. It works for the price.,3,1

I bought the Global Trainer but returned it, mostly because I got a case of buyer's remorse after spending $300, but also because I wasn't that wild about the interfaces of the Device Agent software (which allows you to configure your trainer on your computer) or the data-tracking website (where you upload your training data). Also, I was annoyed that I had to pay a good bit of money ($20 a month, I think) to look at all the data gathered by the trainer (you can see some of it for free, I forget which, maybe heart rate and time). In addition to paying to see the data, you're locked in to using only that system (which is why I'm annoyed with Apple products, but I digress). From what I've read, the Garmin system seems more open as far as being able to export your data to a site like Map My Run.     After being unimpressed with the software (and the so-so speed of the GPS connection), I decided that if I was going to get a waterproof training device, I wanted the Garmin 310, but I didn't want to spend $400 to buy it. So, I returned the Global Trainer and ordered the Garmin 305, which seems like a good deal where I get everything but the waterproof feature for half the price.    On a side note, I searched high and low until I figured out that there are two levels of ANT functionality. I thought I could use my ANT chest strap from my Suunto heart rate monitor with my ANT Global Trainer. It didn't work because my chest strap wasn't ANT+, like the Global Trainer. I found my answer at thisisant. Find the Product Directory, where you can select your device and see the compatible products.",3,1
"There's nothing really wrong with this screen protector, but getting it on in a way that doesn't capture dust and leave bubbles is difficult.  Even having read various tips on getting a dust-free application, I went through an entire package and started a new one before it worked well enough.  There are still bubbles and trapped dust particles under there.  For what it does, it's a good product.  It reduces glare and the matte finish is really nice.  I haven't had a problem with responsiveness, but it is more difficult to clean the smudges and fingerprints from this than from the original screen.  I wouldn't buy it again, but it's good enough to use until I run out of the last 2 I have left from my initial application.",3,1
"I live in Orange County.  You'd think that I would have great HD reception from a variety of broadcasters.  However, the HD signal frequently fades in and out.  You get used to the HD signal.  When it goes to analog it's like someone puts pillows over the speakers.  Also, like another reviewer mentioned . . . sometimes when I start the car I get no sound from the HD radio at all.  The fix is to unplug the power from the box and then plug it back in.  I'm thinking of wiring in a switch because this happens frequently.  When it's working right it's great!",3,1
Was complicated to sintonise and the antena breaks easily.,3,2
i dont think i got the right ipod i think mine might be a 2nd gen cause i doownloaded the rhapsody app and it said i can play with my other apps whie listening to music but it only works for the 3 gen or 4 and i cant listen outside the rhapsody app but even if its not 3G i still liked the price and condition just wish i did get a 3G,3,2
Works fine.,3,1
"Item does what it was designed to do - protect the GPS.  No whistles or bells, just protection.  One problem, if you have it in a car in the summer, it gets very hot.",3,1
"Both my GO 2535 TM and XXL 540 M fit this case just fine. I can just barely stuff in the cord for the 540 in the outside pocket, but the cord for the 2535 has the traffic antenna and won't really fit; But the cord makes such an obnoxious bulge on the case that I will not be using the case for the cord.<br /><br />The details section of the webpage says \\""Soft Sleeve Case Protects your GPS from Bumps, Shock and Scratches\\"" and I agree that it will work very well for scratch protection (we just toss it in the console or my wife's purse), but the case is so soft and thin that it will provide virtually no protection from bumps or shocks; The neoprene it is made from is not rubbery like a wetsuit, but more like a double-knit polyester.<br /><br />The zipper for the main compartment works just well enough that I don't cuss, but the same cannot be said of the zipper for the side compartment. I cuss every time I try to use it. The material is just so flexible that the zipper does not want to slide. We intended to use the side compartment to store a microfiber cloth for cleaning the GPS screen, but looking at a dirty screen is much less annoying to me than having to open and close that dang zipper.<br /><br />I would not buy this case again -- there must be something better out there.",3,1
"Sound is very good for the price.  However, the mic is abysmal.  I had one unit which didn't work at all.  Customer Service was very good, and they replaced it immediately.  Unfortunately, the second unit's mic was only marginally better.  If you want a good value on sound for the money, this is a good unit.  If you want to use this as a speaker phone, you should probably think twice.",3,1
"Product exceeds my expectations and arrived in a timely fashion.  Very happy with both shipment and service, along with a great product.  I highly recommend this to all customers for a future purchase.",3,1
The price is cheap and so are the items.  The retractable USB cable didn't last long at all  :(,3,1
"This has a nice texture to the back of it for holding onto, however it tore after a shirt time.  Probably would ord more than one next time, ok product for price but don't expect into last a long time.",3,1
"As many reviews have stated, both here and on other sites, this is a wonderful device.  The device itself is intuitive, the touch screen well done, it's built like a tank and the navigation through the screens and all the various tools is simple and well thought out.    My only problem: I can't read books on the thing.  The glare/reflection gives me a wicked headache after less than an hour.  It's due to the touch screen being layered on top of the e-ink screen.  I actually returned it because an electronic reading device is of no use to me if I can't comfortably read on it for long periods of time.  Many folks say they can ignore the glare, adjust angles, etc.  If you can: more power to you.  Personally, I don't want to have to worry about angling it just so to read my book.  I want to forget I'm using a device.    That said, when I returned it, I bought a Sony Pocket Edition (PRS-300, one step down and no touch screen).  If you can stand the glare, enjoy it.  If you can't, take a look at the Pocket Edition.",3,2
I ordered one in black and another in red. The one in black was made out of cheaper material compared to the red one. Its good for the price but doesnt last long.,3,1
Can't tell if it charges.<br />Sound doesn't get loud.<br />LOVE the usb factor.<br />Bought it for my eight year old and does fine.,3,1
"For those of you with a cracked Toyota key, and just need the &#34;cover&#34; (as that is what is cracking forst), this key will NOT work. The molding of the cover is different.<br /><br />I have yet to &#34;cut&#34; this key and to use it as I am not yet sure the transponder coil is inside the key (needed in order to bypass the  theft deterrent system), or in the electronics (that I easily can move over from the other key).<br /><br />My non-remote key has the transponder coil molded inside the plastic end of the key. If it is the same here, then I will have to program yet another key into the ECU in order for this to work.",3,1
Item works fine for my Ipod Nano. I am able to use all the functions in the remote control.  Is great for the car.,3,1
"Good quality, great sound, acceptable capabilities. The only thing is the little memory, only 1 Gb, with no option of expansion. With more memory or expansion capabilities, I should give the 5 stars.",3,1
"Seems to be very robust, however it's power is not 20 watts but only 8.",3,2
"It doesn't have an opening at the bottom to plug the cord into. It has an opening for the camera and for the aux cable, but not for the cable that connects into the bottom. Otherwise, the case is very cute.",3,2
"Pros:<br />-Bluetooth works well with iPhone 3GS for phone calls.  Clarity is great to person on other end of the phone.  Voice dial takes many seconds to activate, but then works pretty well; you need to say the whole line in one go, \\""Call John Smith mobile\\""; if you leave out \\""mobile\\"" on the end, you will not be able to then choose from \\""work, home, or mobile\\"".  Once on a call, no problem.<br />-Starts up when vehicle is turned on; defaults to Tuner (radio station).<br />-Audio quality is far better than stock.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-When you connect your iPhone/iPod etc to the Alpine data cable, it locks up the iTunes menu on the phone.  The ONLY way to pick a song is to navigate through the head unit controls. I find this a total pain.  The head unit only displays one line of text, and it's only whatever can be written in the 888888888888 format, such that you can't tell what many letters are easily.  I listen to a lot of podcasts.  I can navigate the different authors of podcasts (This American Life, Car Talk, Economist) on the Alpine HU, but once I pick one, I can't tell one episode from the next, and can't tell which comes first or last in chronological order.  Sometimes I'll unplug the damn iPhone so I can pick the podcast I want, then plug it back in to play it.  This is such a stupid, stupid, stupid, STUPID feature, makes me want to sell the damn Alpine and buy a Kenwood.  I may do it, depending on price.<br />-The Alpine-specific iPod cable is THICK, and thus a bit more of a hassle to manage/run.  Some will care, some will not.<br />-Radio reception is far worse, but that may or may not be my own fault, as I did not do any 'over and above' wiring to keep the antenna happy; just plug and play.  Look up the radio on your car to see if you need to take extra care to feed it power.<br />-Only one set of pre-amp outputs.  This is in the specifications and manual, so you can't hold it against them.  But be aware, you will need to upgrade to the CDE-126BT if youwant to amp both speakers and subwoofer(s).<br /><br />Summary:<br />-Great for bluetooth hands free calling.<br />-Terrible for iPod list navigating.<br /><br />I would NOT buy again.",3,1
"I got the new Clip Zip to replace my lost Clip+, and am happy with it -- the color screen is a great upgrade, and the product looks and feels good.  Unfortunately SanDisk decided to tweak the firmware, and removed the option to view the track length / current position in track length from the player.  While not totally necessary, I find the lack of such a simple option frustrating.",3,1
It claims it gives street names but I can't get it to say anything but turn right in 100ft. No Street Names. No traffic control. The satellite radio is great. The FM is scratchy.,3,1
"It worked ok, but i didnt feel my rough abuse of keys would let this survive.  Neat concept, but just not for Rugged use.",3,2
lasted less than three years. not a great record for a radio considering that radios from the 1920's exist n perfect working condition.  In this case it is the CD player that messed up.  I would guess that i have opened and closed the cd drawer 100 times since the sterio arrived.  One day it would not open and now every time that i start the unit it spends 3 to 5 minutes trying to open up and when i shut it doen same thing.  Naturally i harbor no delusions of playing CD's but this problem makes it a problem to do anything else too.  After the drawer thing gives up then yu can listen to the radio or the thumb drive of whatever. i ecpect a better longevity on a device that costs $250.  I have a sony clock radio that is 15 years old and still works fine.  After reading the reviews i chose this device over similar ones shown on amazon and after returning one that did not sound like it was worth the money.  so i guess it is too costly to throw away. i shall probably look for a repair center...,3,2
"seriously such a cute case. but it doesn't protect your iPod, its just for looks. and the gems are constantly falling off. i recommend a silicone case.",3,2
"I love this case and the plank design, but it gets scratched way to easily. If it is shown under natural or direct light, you can see all the mark but you can't see them unless you look straight on top of it, but that is annoying. It won't protect your iPod well, but the design is awesome so its overall a cool case, but I wouldn't get it if you want protection.",3,1
"Not quite big enough for our Droid, but it gets the job done.  Use it for biking and jogging. Just fits really snug.",3,1
"This screen protector is not what is pictured in the picture. It doesn't have the cut out at the bottom for the \\""n\\"". It stops where the edge of the touch screen ends which is above the little \\""n\\"". Also, it's not an \\""anti-glare\\"" protector either.  I guess if you're looking for a cheap protector for your nook... this is good for you. But if you want what's advertised in the title, i wouldn't recommend buying it.  It works for as a temporary screen protector, I guess.  I wish the seller would put a REAL protector up instead of the one that advertises that it fits the entire screen.  I'm disappointed, but that's what i get for paying a little over $3.00.",3,2
"I bought this to use with my Lifeproof case on and iphone 4. I does fit in the port, but requires the &#34;door&#34; on the Lifeproof case to be opened wider than I am comfortable with. 3 stars because it did charge the phone and play audio.",3,1
Looked cheap once I had it on.,3,2
"I just got this case about 3 days ago. When I got the case, there was a tiny crack right above the home button which was dissapointing. From there the case was really nice but as soon as I dropped It it cracked right on the top right corner of the case. I used some clear tape to prevent it from cracking anymore, but it was very dissapointing seeing it crack the first time I dropped it.",3,1
sometimes not work very well,3,2
It was small good product,3,1
The product fit well. This is just for an emergency case. Looks like the pictures and recommend it for adults only,3,1
"Product is functional but not great . The sound is fair takes some playing with to find a station that gives a clear sound , still notice feedback and static from time to time . There has to be a better product out there . Item arrived fast .",3,1
Music played really nicely but speakerphone option had way too much echo and poor sound quality transmission.,3,2
"Speaker is ok, box is more well built than I expected. However, hardware to install the mounting bracket was not included. Kicker is sending it to me its just a pia. Wish it hit a little harder but what did I expect out of one ten?",3,1
"It works, but not on my ipod it didn't fit.I gave it to a friend, it works, but make sure it will fit!",3,1
"Hello,<br />I received the product and installed today for my IX-35. The product seems OK and a proffessional car audio installer did the connections and everything fine but not the steeling wheel control and I feel really frustrated because I want to use it. Connections are right but when I'm trying to configure the funtions on software and do what user manual says and move controls on my steeling wheel it doesn't work. What should I do?... it is really urgent to me to fix this..",3,2
"This was a great product, however, i have a few things that are negative. First off, the long extension mount that hooks on your front windshield is really bouncy and doesn't stay still. if i choose to take that off and hook it on the vent, the air doesn't come through if i have the AC/heat on. which isn't a big deal, but its kinda annoying. Does what it should, but they should come out with a more stable mount that hooks on the dashboard or something. idk.",3,1
"The mirrored screen protector does look pretty cool, but it doesn't fit the screen entirely. It leaves a small amount of the screen around the edge and it's just enough to make it look weird. It doesn't look like the picture shown, and I had a very hard time trying to put it on (and I've put on lots of screen protectors before, and flawlessly at that), it still has quite a few air bubbles in it! All in all, I'm not very pleased with this product, I think it could've been a better fit and quality!",3,1
i purchased this case off of ebay one day and i was super exited when i recieved it. I put it on and it was hard to put on at first.  But i got it on. About 5-6 hours later i got to charge it and for some reason my usb cord wasnt working. I then realized that the little peice inbetween the headphone jack and the usb port was in the way and would not let my cable go in. This made me a little mad and i have to take the case off at night when i go to charge it. do not recommend this case to anyone. But it protects the device so i still use it.,3,2
"I have a second generation, one thing I didn't like was the hole at the top, since my ipod doesn't have a camera. I wish they made this without the camera hole. This was actually really pretty but it started peeling after a couple weeks and it already came with scratches on it. After a couple months the front plate bent forward and made the edges warped once it was on my ipod. Not really worth $9.",3,2
"This is an OK product, It's a bit combersome.",3,1
It works..but its cheaply made.,3,2
"This stereo is just as easy to install as any in this price range. It is however not very user friendly and has poor sound quality. I say pay an extra $20 for the sony. It is a manual tuner (knob) and there are no programmable radio buttons. Also the equalizer consists of three modes rather than customizing bass, treble, etc. All of the modes seem to have to much bass. The volume controller is two buttons rather than a knob. Also all of the buttons seem difficult to push, you really have to push hard. I guess you get what you pay for.",3,2
"Fairly easy to use- a plug and play device. Although has capacity to record both sides of a cassette tape, it is best to supervise recording and record one side at a time. Also, software that comes with the unit to enable recording defaults to record tape in separate tracks. This function is not reliable and it is best to deselect this option and record as one long track. Software is supposed to detect end of tape and stop recording but continues to record until manually stopped so an added reason to supervise recording. This is a good solution for the price. The more professional devices run over $400.",3,1
Seems simple enough. The directions were in Chinese. With a little common sense you can figure it out.<br /><br />There is nothing spectacular or special about this product. Average build quality.<br /><br />It does exactly what it says it does.,3,1
"It is not so bad but could have been better. I wish it had a little into them, it would have been more enjoyable.",3,1
"It did protect my iPad when I accidentally dropped it on the floor. After that, it splits a little bit. After I install this item, it did scratch the back of my iPad.",3,1
"Experimentando con el GPS para conocerlo, en la funciòn de &#34;restaurar el sistema&#34; aplique que SI y me borro el mapa y no puedo recuperarlo. Le agradecería me ayudaran al respecto si alguien sabe como hacerlo con este producto. Por lo general esta bien.",3,1
I REALY LIKE THE EQUIPMENT. ALL ITENS ACCORDING TO MY EXPECTATION. I´M SATISFY WITH MY NEW ACQUISITION. THAT´S REALY OKAY!,3,1
"The battery life is great (much better than the Sansa Clip), so I gave it three stars. It might work great for music, but it's a real pain for audiobooks. Audiobooks did not download into separate folders, so I had to scroll through a really long list of files to start a book that wasn't at the top of the list. It did not resume at the last place I left off when I shut it down for the night. It does allow bookmarks, but after playing through the end of the chapter or part that had the bookmark, it would loop around and start playing the same chapter/part all over again and never automatically progressed to the next one. I ended up returning the unit. Too bad, because I really liked the battery life. It's a little on the large side, although it's very lightweight, and there are no accessories available for it. Some firmware adjustments might turn it into a much better product for the millions of audiobook listeners in the world.",3,2
"This dash insert does fill the space between a double DIN radio and the dash opening, yet its texture does not quite match.  I am also concerned at the strength of the tabs, as they seem a bit flimsy.  It will work for now, but I am looking at finding one that looks a little higher quality. As for fit, it does fit fairly well.  For most buyers, it will be good enough.",3,1
"Potential purchasers should know that the battery compartment in this case differs from that in my 2001 Audi A6 OEM keyfob - These hold larger batteries.  I ended up not using that part of the case.  Rest of the case is interchangeable.  Removing circuit board from the OEM case (to put it into this replacement) is more involved than many may wish to attempt.  There are 2 semi-permanent mounting pins holding down the circuit board that cannot be removed with a screwdriver -- or anything else short of brute force and a pair of needle-nose pliers.  Also, be sure to remove the pill pod for the encryption chip on the other side of the case and to put it into the new case.  Cut key may be removed from metal turning mount by removing cotter pin, and then placed into the new mount sold with this set.",3,2
"Sounds ok at low volume, distortion and bass suppression set in above that.<br />Also, that ENGRISH voice when you change the setting sounded a little like a Japanese stereotype.",3,2
The pens and screen protector were great I like them alot!<br /><br />The headphones were very cheap and uneven!!! I was disspointed. I contated the vendor and was told that is the style. Perhaps it should be noted on the description.,3,1
I had so many problems with the one i had and the screen in side was messed up .the earphones didnt work. but other then that is was ok . it got to me quick .but if i didnt have those problems i would love it .,3,1
"This was what was expected. I have bought cases for $1.97 on Amazon and they were very nicely made, this was not bad. Son liked it.",3,1
"I bought this item for use with my Garmin Nuvi 265WT. Any reference I make to \\""fit\\"" is limited to use with that product.    The shade does secure to the product, but it's more of a friction fit based on the spring clasps in the back. I was hoping for more of a \\""click-in\\"" custom fit. It's worth noting the product makes no such promise, so don't hold my assumptions against it. Once in place, the shade does conform nicely to the size and position of my Nuvi's display.    This is advertised as a sun shade. I've never really had problems with sun glare on my GPS. What was bothering me, though, is the reflection of the GPS display in the windshield at night. (I mount mine low - if you're one of those \\""middle of the windshield\\"" people I see on the highway, you probably don't have this problem. But I also don't know how you can stand having this thing in the middle of your field of vision all the time.)    My hope in using the shield was to block that upward reflection. The shade does not do that very well -- and note again, it's not the advertised function. If I tilt the whole GPS down, farther than I'd ordinarily prefer, I get only partial relief from the bright reflection that I see higher on the windshield.    My suggestion would be the creation of a different shield that extends farther forward (and in a straight line, not along a curve) to address the intended use I've described.",3,1
"I really enjoyed this product only if it was for the right nook we had. I kept it anyway , really cute as a cover for a book..",3,1
"OK for the price, but doesn't really work while using the tablet. There's no window for the camera, so you have to remove it from the case, kind of defeating the purpose.",3,2
"Not quite the quality sound I expected, but still very good",3,1
Not what I expected. No ports for headphones.,3,1
Fantastic item!!! Great for the Nook Simple Touch as it is really easy to access while encased.<br />color is good.,3,1
"Overall the armband does it's job; however, my wife has a fourth generation ipod and apparently this armband was made for a newer generation. The hole for the ear phone jack is in the opposite end so my wife has to put the iPod in upside down to use it. But who could argue with the price.",3,1
I am sure it probably works fine it was just not the right item. I needed a charger for the I pad 4th Gen not 1st.,3,1
"product is very thin only for looks ,It looks cool but if you want a protective case this isnt the one to buy.",3,2
"This is a very nice case, however it does not fit the gps as described.  This is the second case that I have had to return to amazon for this reason.  I finally got the right size on the third try.",3,2
"FM Transmitter works well, with some noise. The charger side broke within a week or two of purchase. Don't count on the charger to last long.",3,2
"This camera is good when it works.  Some features could be better thought out. For instance, there should be a simple ON and OFF button on the camera so it can be turned off in parking mode.  I understand that a Magic Jack can be ordered (which increases the price for additional $45 and it will automatically cut the power to the camera to prevent a car-battery discharge), however, I would like to have a choice of a simple ON and OFF button instead of complicated wiring for Magic Jack.<br />This camera's GPS chip burn out on a hot summer day and at that point there would be no correct time and location of recorded videos.<br />Seller partially refunded the money, although I was interested in a new camera replacement.<br />Overall, I wouldn't recommend this camera until the price drops due to it's unreliability.",3,1
"I ordered this not expecting a whole lot for the money. After researching reviews, its clear that you can't buy a high quality FM transmitter without spending more money.<br /><br />Pros: It works. Company that shipped it did a good job.<br /><br />Cons: It has a VERY short range. I was 10 feet away and it still had static unless I touched the unit with my hand. Also, the plug had to be rotated to get a clear sound, as if it had a slight short inside it. The insulation was already starting to break away from the plug too. So it's clear that it is made of very cheap, low quality materials. I wrapped electrical tape around it to make it last longer (hopefully).<br /><br />It includes a 12-volt cigarette lighter charger which has a proprietary connector. Which is fairly stupid in my opinion. They should have used a standard mini or micro USB connection. That way we could simply use our cell phone or camera cords to power it up. Instead we got a 10 inch long cord that will render this unit inoperable when it shorts out. But what can you expect for a few dollars? A few weeks of FM transmission probably. Only buy this if you are too broke to buy a better one.",3,2
easy to configure but the sound is not that high for my ipad,3,1
The strap is long enough but not comfortable. I took it to work and ended up with three bruises on my arm because of it! There isn't any support or comfort. The case works well.  The screen protectors were old and/or cheap. The placement stickers didn't come off all the way so I have gunk on my screen and iPOD's backside.,3,2
instructions were poor and I still haven't got it to record my voice,3,2
"Bought it for my 12yr old brother. When it came (fast shipping 3days) he was exicted and it worked great. Package contained the player, manual, usb charging and connect cord, manual, software disk, headphones, and a limited warranty. It worked great ...then like a couple of weeks later I hear my brother complaining about how it wont charge anymore. It was fine while it lasted :/",3,2
"I can see why these were customer return refurbs: has trouble keeping satellite lock even with clear sky, often shows you driving through the middle of adjacent block instead of on road, sometimes jumps you to an adjacent street 2 or 3 blocks away, etc. Finally I tried loading alternate software, at which point it quit detecting an SD card in its slot.",3,2
"This is a pretty good case for what it is. Offers good protection for a cheap price  Pros: Hard case to protect against scratches        Has inside pocket to put small things        Pretty simple design  Cons: Buttons are hard to use when Kobo is strapped in        The straps cover the blue light on the Kobo  Overall its a pretty decent case. I bought it so my reader wouldn't get scratched while in my backpack so it does a good job of that. If you like to read your Kobo in the case just know the buttons are hard, but not impossible, to access while it is strapped in.",3,1
Audio is not as clear as it should be.,3,2
"I bought a Sony cover locally. I returned it because $30 seemed steep---not to mention, exploitative---for a couple of pieces of textured vinyl with two little plastic pegs to hold the Reader by its left side only.<br /><br />When I saw this Proporta cover, the photos gave me the idea it actually had a pocket that held the Reader. That seemed like a much better idea.<br /><br />But when the cover arrived today, I was disappointed to find it was virtually identical to the Sony cover. (It wouldn't surprise me if they were made in the same factory.) What I thought was a pocket in the Proporta photo was apparently just light reflecting off of the sides of the Reader.<br /><br />Fortunately, the Proporta cover was the same price as Sony's. The only difference was that I had to wait for a month to get it.",3,2
"It's kind of a cool little amp/FM tuner but seems to be more like 5w+5w.  So, you get what you pay for.",3,1
It support multiple power outlet system around the world but there is no grounding.,3,1
"What is good about it first....<br />Currently I am typing on it, so it touch response is good. It doesnt mess up the Note touch feature. In contrast though the pen does stick a little more. But like someone else mentioned, you may not like feeling like you are writing on glass to begin with. Personally, I dont like writing on this screen protector. It feels too rubbery to me. I didnt mind writing on the glass. This removes the smoothness for sure.<br /><br />Another good then bad......<br />It offers excellent glare reduction. In contrast though, it does fuzzy up the picture substantially.<br /><br />It is very thick which offers great scratch protection, but again reduces the smoothness when writing.<br /><br />Overall my initial gut feeling was disappointment but I realize its not so much a fault but a preference. The pprotection level and glare reduction is good, I just wish it wasnt so rubbery. I was going to do 4 stars even though I was slightly disappointed, but the fuzziness took away another star. I have 2 notes here, side by side, and it is very noticeable.",3,1
"Pros: Silicone case is great fits perfect no issues, Screen Protector works, Sync Cable also works.<br /><br />Cons: Wall charger died second day, one week the plastic pocket clip thing broke, headphones definitely not comfortable stick with my zune brand ones.<br /><br />It is what is for the price.",3,1
"I don't like the screen protector at all.  It was difficult to put on, in spite of the instructions they sent.  And no matter how I tried, there are still bubbles underneath and they irritate me.

This software is exactly the same as NG map 201 which I carry for all hiking at YNP. It has good detail but not quite as good as the 4 more detailed maps that NG does of YNP - map numbers 302 thru 305. These maps show back country campsites and better mileage and topo detail.    My complaint with NG maps is why they didn't use the more detail that they have available to make the software map. It is simply a picture of the map 201.,3,1
"I got this due to it being about the only green amp wire I could find at a reasonable price; however it is certainly not a full 4 gauge, the outside covering makes up most of the diameter. The actual wire is more like an 8 gauge... It works for my reasons, but if you're looking for an actual 4 gauge wire then look elsewhere... I am quite pleased with the color though...",3,1

"When I purchased this MP3 player for my car, I was surprised at the low cost. I now am happy that I spent so little to get a pretty good quality product. There are times when it gets a little fuxzy with static, and sometimes there is a slight buzz behind the music, but most of the time with a little adjusting I can eliminate the fuzz.    My one major negative is that it starts from song #1 every time you restart your car when using an SD card or USB drive. Unlike a cd that starts up where you left off, this always returns to song #1 so if you aren't sure what number you were on when you turned the car off, good luck finding your place.     I do enjoy the ability to plug in sd flash cards, usb flash drives or my MP3 player to the unit. The MP3 player is best also, because it remembers the last song you were listening to...unlike the SD card or USB drive.",3,1
I got this for my iPod touch... But I was actualy sent one for the iPhone which is a bigger button... Over all it isn't a bad product I was just sent the wrong one and it wasn't worth sending back for a replacement.,3,2
"We recently bought a 9020 and experienced the same power plug issue described here (and on other sites with reviews for this product).  We were going to return it but I decided to contact Magellan because I couldn't believe they could release a product where the mounting bracket prevented a good connection for the power cord.  While on the call to Magellan tech support to ask about this issue, I noticed grooves on the sides of the plug.  These are for sliding the plug onto the mounting bracket BEFORE the bracket is slid onto the unit.  With the plug in place on the bracket before the bracket is installed, the plug is very securely in place and cannot fall out.  This also corrected, to some extent, the screen brightness issue since the quality of the contact with the power supply affects brightness. The booklet that came with the unit does show a picture of the plug with an arrow pointing towards the bracket, but I didn't notice that until after our first test drive with the gps. Magellan should probably put some words other than \\""install the power cord as shown\\"" because this could be a big problem for users. I hope this helps other 9020 owners.",3,2
"It is truly red, and it has a position to stand up, but, only horizontally, which is good, but not great.  It is thin, but, it acts as a nice cover (not a protector).  This item was shipped very quickly!  I was very happy with the seller!  I just don't really care for the quality of the case, because it is not leather, it is plastic, and something else?!  But, the price does tell it all!  It works, it's just not what you want, if you want a heavy/thick protector case.  It is nice to be able to close it, like a book.",3,1
"It didn't all fit in perfect & I had to roll up a piece scotch tape to hold down the battery which then made solid contact, until I did this it was not working correctly.",3,1

"After some confusion (no documentation), I got my GA5151 installed in my 2004 Mazda 3. I have used it now for about 3 weeks. I love having the functionality of an Android tablet in my head unit. I use my phone as a mobile hotspot so I can use Maps, Waze, Pandora, etc. UPDATE: the Wi-Fi functionality often does not work and for 5-10 minutes after start. Screen Mirroring DOES NOT WORK, and since this is the most advertised function, I was tempted to send it back (to China). I have tried connecting a Note 4, S3, Galaxy Tab, and Kindle Fire with no success. :( If I do get it to work I will update this. I am able to use my steering buttons. The functionality of the radio application is not user friendly and it sounds horrible for all but the strongest signal stations, but I don't use the radio much anyway. The boot up time is about 1-2 minutes and reconnecting the Wi-Fi connection each trip can be even slower. If I want to listen to Pandora on a 5 minute trip to the store, I will spend most of the route in silence trying to get it to start :( There is no included documentation. There is a pdf installed in the unit, but it is difficult to understand and of little use. I assume the advertised functionality of dimming the display when headlights are on would work if it were wired properly, but how to do so is not apparent. I have not figured out how to connect the old LCD that sits on top or if that would work. The USB flash drive is not limited to 16GB, I connected a 128 GB thumb drive with no problem. :) I have not found the advertised option of changing the 86 opening logo splash screen nor changing between 9 LED button lighting colors :(  Overall, I still like the functions that the stock radio doesn't have, but I am disappointed in the advertised functions that don't work.  Installation tips: 1) loosen the side brackets on the HU to allow the holes of the LCD module on top to align to the holes in the side brackets. 2) if the bottom of the unit does not sit flush intothe environmental control module below, you may have to (carefully) remove the while clips from your old unit to use in the GA5151.",3,2

"This little unit is packed with features and is a good 1st time buy. I will be looking for a larger screen version in future. Pros: highly detailed map/terrain visuals, choice of 4 day/night colour modes, multiple voice/language directions, virtual compass is always displayed while driving or navigating a planned route unlike Garmin 265W, can watch satellite aquisition progress, 2G built in memory, SD-memory card slot, fly-over or simulate planned route. Cons: screen is high-glare, slow satellite aquisition which is very sensitive to location inside the car, unit is either on or off (needs standby), short battery life, when mounted in a car the on/menu button rattles loudly (needs a fix!), there is no disable button for u-turns, and specific to maps from Naviextras: Candle Lake, SK, Canada, most roads and sites that have been in existence for 30 yrs are incomplete, called 'unnamed road' while these are fully listed on the Garmin 265W system.

"This is a good manual, not outstanding, yet worth the price for general reference. It is in no way even close to being on the same level with the authorized Merc factory manual. I purchased this manual for for working on an early  '94 25 HP powerhead (pre Mercosil), and found some of the specifications and detail for the 25 HP engine lacking. Fort example, there is no exploded diagram for the 25 HP crankshaft assembly, and the listed cylinder compression for the 25 - 60 HP is shown as 'no more than 15 PSI variation between cylinders. Other size powerheads seem to get somewhat better attention to detail, and the section covering the lower unit / gearcase is much better.You may want to review this book before buying to make sure specific information you may be looking for is included.",3,1
I bought several of these for my work place they work well. the reson i bought them was because they could use the memory cards or usb stick. the area we work in does not get great recieption inside the building. so thats why we use the usab/memory slots. so we can hear our own tunes.,3,1
I love the texture and design and that it's sheer. What I don't like is that it's not ipod deck friendly.

"Perhaps simply the unit I received  was defective, maybe it was the 8 g class 10 PNY card that contributed to the issues described below regardless it arrived not as described...and is going back.<br /><br />I really wanted to keep the unit , since it's one of the few that allows 1 minute cycle time as well as under 120 degree field of view (70 degrees at full res).  At 70 degrees the video is a bit restrictive but that's the unit's highest resolution. 120 offers lower res, and a slightly disturbing fisheye effect. 70 degrees is certainly livable and would normally give you a field of view comparable to what you would see with your eyes provided you looked straight ahead.(maybe a bit less).<br /><br />First,  I ordered this GS 600 with 2.07 firmware (MPH ) what showed up was a unit with 2.1.1 KM/H firmware.  (Not a good sign).<br />Emails to vendor  and DOD went unanswered in a timely manor (as of this writing no answer) about whether or not the firmware could be updated or modified to 2.0.7 MPH.<br />Also my particular unit has a weird video stutter every 1 second , the audio was fine (good really) but the video was grainy (auto settings) and during the 1 minute videos ,every second as counted by the clock display whether the car was in motion or not the video would hiccup. Maybe it doesn't do that with the time/date display disabled but it's a feature that's important when recording event related videos (accidents etc).<br /><br />The video quality at high res was nothing astounding certainly worse than what I've seen on You Tube, worse than my canon SD90's video at 640x 480 30fps.  It was alright if played back on my mac at half screen size or smaller But, at every 1 minute when the unit recycled it took 1-2 seconds for the video to clean up to full res (it was a bit pixelated at the beginning of each clip).<br />Perhaps that was the fault of my computer or quicktime or the PNY card.<br /><br />Expect the video to have reflections of the ventilation system on your dash as well as anything sitting  on your dash, (GPS etc) depending on the angle of the windshield glass and distance of the camera from the windshield.<br />The pros:<br /><br />The GPS lock worked well, loosing in tunnels regaining quickly when exiting.<br />The speed seemed accurate , once converted from KM to MPH via something called Math .<br />The suction cup mount held securely even when driven on pothole strewn Michigan roadways. Those with problems need to remove the protective plastic on the suction cup then give it another go..<br /><br />It's fairly small and unobtrusive once you hide your cabling , but it would be nice to have the connector for the power on the top of the unit rather than the bottom. (just to clean up the install a bit more).<br />Power cable should be long enough to route to power in most vehicles.  I wouldn't mind having the option to have the LED lights (blue and red) to go covert at night.<br /><br />The Cons:<br /><br />Video grainy at times(cloudy day, auto settings ,Hard sharpness, medium contrast (.-03 ev)).  Even when attached to a monitor with video direct from the unit, results weren't stellar.<br />It's pretty difficult inserting and extracting the micro SD card. You may need to use a flat edge of a screwdriver or SD card to pop that baby out.. and the angles once mounted don't help. ( I generally needed to unmount the device from the suction bracket) then get the card out.  While this normally wouldn't be an issue if you use the device to simply capture your own accident..having it recycle the video day after day unattended . For those of you who need to review the video on a computer daily...it's an absolute pain. If it was a full size card instead of a micro it probably wouldn't be as big a deal.<br /><br />Remote control has some flaws , one of the buttons used to advance through the menus depressed itself far into the remote and became intermittent after about 5 presses.<br /><br />I guess I'm back to ground zero regarding Dash cams. The Blackvue's look nice except they only shoot 120 degrees, certainly they seem easier to unmount from the window mount if you need to pop out the card.<br />But you'd have to purchase a second mount if you need to transfer the camera to a different vehicle for a short period of time (rental) where a suction cup mount does have it's advantages.<br /><br />This one is going back to Amazon for a refund since the MPH 2.0.7 version is no longer on their site.",3,2
"I wanted to like this thing, given the number of favorable reviews I saw. However, some design flaws kept it from being a keeper.<br /><br />The sound quality is excellent for its size; musical and well-balanced. However, I did not think it was able to play loudly enough to make it versatile. In a quiet room the sound volume is adequate. Outdoors or in a somewhat noisy space, the volume is disappointing. Granted, this is a fairly small speaker. I did find myself wanting more, though.<br /><br />Even more important from a design perspective: the speaker does not let you know when it's fully charged. The manual states that the led will stop flashing when it's fully charged. With my unit, that was not true; even after more than 20 hours of charging, the light was still flashing and I had no idea if the unit was charged or not. Furthermore, there is no way of determining how much charge is remaining. With a rechargeable device, charging fully but not overcharging is critical to maximizing the life of the battery. These issues taken together led me to return the speaker.<br /><br />I have since purchased the Soundfreaq Sound Kick. More money ($100 retail; on sale for $80 at Target), but addresses all of the shortcomings of the Oontz.",3,2
"one thing about FM transmitter is that it can get static from other channels and this one has no exception. I bought this one thinking the unit is very clean and not having to mess around with cables and wires, however, it has so much static and the volume was little too. I don't understand why it can't be louder. Maybe I got a bad unit or something but I got static on all channels I set to. Besides from that, this unit has no problem with the lcd screen or power. I like the fact that it plug right in to the car charger and there you have it like a little control that came with the car.<br /><br />for anyone wanting an FM unit, I wouln'd recommend this though.",3,1

"I gave it 3 stars only out of a \\""give it the benefit of the doubt\\"" sense of fairness.  In truth, I was unable to rate this device because I was unable to use it.  You must be running XP and you must install Windows Media Player 10.  Although my laptop has XP, I was unable to install wmp 10 on it -- w/o wmp 10, the device is useless. <br /> <br />I would have preferred something that just looks like a removeable disk drive and plays media in its native format -- possibly with extensible firmware for supporting DRM using alternative distribution format (e.g. RAX).  Running everything through the wmp blender for download strikes me as inelegant.  Also, my Real Player environment hung when I tried to install the extensions for the PMC. <br /> <br />May be a great device, but seems poorly conceived from an architectural perspective.",3,2

"I like that I was able to find this type of case for my Ipod Gen 4 Nano in a light blue color.  Unlike my leather ipod case that I had for my first Gen Ipod nano, this one seems to rub it's color off alot easier, nothing major though.  The way the Ipod case closes I think is an inconvenience when you are trying to change a song while trying to look at the screen without taking it off.  Either you will be straining to look at it upside down. The clip on the back can be turned so it's rightside up so give you more options on how to wear it.  Either way, it's still very hard to read the screen while having it attached to your pocket...almost inpossible.  My previous Ipod case had a better design so when you opened it while it was on your pants it was actually facing towards you rather than away.    The case has done well to keep my Ipod safe. Wish the design was a bit better as it does have it's flaws.  However, this is the best Gen 4 case I've seen so far.",3,1
"If you are just concerned about protection then this is the perfect case. My daughter puts the case on whenever she leaves the house with her iPod. She has dropped her iPod several times with the case on and it provides plenty of protection.

When she tries to FaceTime anyone she has to take the case off because the other person is unable to hear her.",3,1
"After witnessing some really great driving skills lately, I decided it was best if I invested in a dashboard camera to protect my 6. In Alaska, dump truck drivers do not have to have covers over their loads, so rocks fall regularly while you are behind them.

Unfortunately that is not the case.<br />It does a fine job of taking decent video and you can definitely tell when something happens clearly enough.<br />I haven't been able to use the G-force option yet (thankfully), so I can't say with certainty that it works.

"I have had this XO skin installed on a Galaxy Nexus for a week now. The install process was simple and easy. After installing there were very small bubbles left, but I knew these would eventually go away. Letting it dry over night took care of most of the bubbles, and by the following day all of them had disappeared. So far there has not been an orange peel effect, which is great and all, but I usually don't see it until approximately a month in.<br /><br />I do have a complaint though, one that bothers me quite a bit, whether it is the glass, display type, or the XO Skin itself, im not 100% positive. There are very fine streaks, mostly prominent against white backgrounds and pages. Up to this point i have been debating whether or not to uninstall the XO skin. I'm pretty disappointed with this because it detracts from the beautiful screen.<br /><br />The quality of the screen protector is good, the cut out for the case fit protector is great, but I am not sure I can deal with the rainbow-hairfine-streaks.",3,1
"I recently acquired this charging station when I purchased a new iPod Classic 160 GB.  (Replacing a 5 year old 60 GB Photo Classic that died after a rather short life, in my opinion.)  This charging station fulfills the same function as the charging station that came with my old iPod (no charging station with the new one) plus provides a simple function remote for working with the music.  Basically, you can turn the iPod on or off, adjust volume, or move forward or back on the current play list.  All the functionality I need.  I cannot comment about the range because my desk is barely 5 feet from my stereo.   Seems to work fine over that range.    My concerns:    One: For some reason the charging base has a pilot light that seems essentially useless.    Two: The fit of the iPod into the base is not \\""tight\\"" like the base was with my old iPod.  I wonder if, over time, this will put a strain on the connector pins on the base and/or the iPod.    Three: Having previously used an AirClick remote with my old iPod, I note that this remote carries forward two annoying features.    First, it has a switch to enable/disable the remote.  In my experience, this was a useless feature that more often was bumped in error and led to frustration thinking the remove was not working.    Second, if you need to replace the battery inside the remote (it lasted a long time for me with my older AirClick) the bottom of the remote is held on by three of the tiniest screws you can imagine.  Ultimately i lost two of the screws on my old remote.  Sometimes I would have to take the base off because the battery would shift out of position.    Overall, this product is pretty good.  I did not really cross shop other products to see if there was something better because the price was reasonable and it met my needs.  Really my biggest concern is about the way the 160 GB iPod Classic is not tightly held in the base.",3,2
"Used these speakers with 300 watt, 2 channel Rockford Fosgate Punch amp.  The speakers sounded great for a short while until the tweeters stopped working.  This product's tweeters may be very sensitive.",3,2
The bluthooth connection keep announcing to connect. The volume up and down button is confusing.,3,2
Blue tooth is fine- just like my other one.  Charger sent in package is not only the wrong connection but also damaged & doesn't work.  Tried to get it replaced but unable to do so.  Not good customer service.  Will NOT order from this vendor again!,3,2
SOOOO I thought it was going to be light blue but it came in a dark purple. HA! Other then the color change I still liked the case. It was cute and a lot of people liked it.,3,1
"It, [[ASIN:B005LBPF7Q Mini CD/AM/FM/Single Cassette Player/Recorder W/Detachable Speakers Programmable Track Memory]] functions!<br />Nothing to rave about in this Coby CXCD400BLK mini CD/AM/FM/Single Cassette.<br />However, for the shipper, Capital Electronics, 5 stars for the 1.5 days to transport it to me!<br />We really APPRECIATE the swift delivery!<br /><br />To the people looking for a portable stereo know what you want and know what this is.<br />If you want a well made product to be proud of or more... then this is not it.<br />If you want something functional and at low expense then this can fit your price range.<br />The plastic is of the cheap crackable kind that begs to expect cracks, fading/tarnishing and scratches very soon and the sound quality is not for boomboxers nor for audiophiles. The black glossy finish coating on the plastic reminds me of fingernail polish and tapping it rings of hollow cavity seperated by a thin, fragile plastic layer<br />But I'm elderly and this will replace our old portable at the pool-side patio and it meets our need.",3,2
"Shape and quality could use a little work. I purchased this for a Sansa E250 mp3 player and it's as big as the player. After a little while, the 3.5mm jack pulled out of the main unit, a little disappointed, however to be fair, I had been a little rough on the unit as I would just throw the unit and mp3 player in my coat pocket and from there it would get tossed around with my coat.",3,2
"Mine came a bit too snug and the stitching was a bit crooked, most probably wouldn't notice actually, the feature that I bought it for, the ablity to stand it up, work great though. Even if I had known how it would fit before hand, I would still have gotten it.",3,1
"The looks of the case are fine, but the Ipod has almost slid out several times. I will purchase a different case.",3,1
I returned this product because it was too complicated for ME to understand. Also it did not have a charger with it.,3,2
This plug is not compatible with some cigarette lighter sockets. E.g it was not worked with lighter socket in my Toyota Corolla.<br />I had to replace the positive contact of the plug with longer one (about 2-3 mm).<br />Plug's positive contact is not reaching positive contact of lighter socket.<br />I think it happens because there is no ringed groove in front end of the plug -- plug's front end a little bit bulky.<br /><br />The idea is great but plug requires some tuning.,3,2
"Plugs into iphone with lifeproof cover with some effort. Plugs into charger with some effort. In other words, not a perfect fit and you have to play with it a bit to get it to connect at either side. I've had a few issue when connecting it to iradios. The dock connector is offset just enough so I can't connect it without forcing it. It's a good deal since it's half the price of the actual lifeproof extender. However, for the hassle, I'lll pay the extra and get the exact brand next time.",3,1
"I am updating this review to let people know that there are other, probably more economical and better sounding options out there for purchase than this model.  I waited to post about this product for some months because I wasn't sure what I thought about it.  Every so often, there would be what I perceived to be a \\""network surge\\"" that killed the wifi connection.  This would shut the unit down in mid-play, and the connectionhad to be re-established.  This could  sometimes take about 7 minutes from the shut down to the boot back up -  not always so convenient.  I did two things that seemed to resolve this problem; one was a factory reset, which can be done from the control panel.  The second was accepting a recent software update (the radio's screen \\""asked\\"" if I wanted to do the update).  Subsequent to these maneuvers, the product has worked without any issues but is not really reliable for a party or if you just want to set up a station and do other things.  AM is unlistenable.  The sound quality of this radio, I think, is equivalent to our Bose, and I actually prefer the sleeker look of this model.  Also, it has a port for plugging in an ipod which is wonderful.  In addition, I can turn on home sharing to Itunes,  and can access my entire music library from other computers on our family network.<br /><br />There are good features and the sound is good, but something in its internal design is not engineered correctly.",3,2
This item arrived very promptly and exactly as described. The leather of this case was not the quality that was expected.  It fits the Nook and works as described.,3,1
"Good for the price.  Good for magnifying sounds nearby.  Earphones are easily knocked out if you move around, and connection to box may be affected.",3,1
"I just wanted 'just an' earphone, probably that's the reason I did not bother going to a shop nearby and by it in a day than ordering it online and waiting for 10 more days.<br /><br />I really hoped it would be like the one which I just broke. It turned out to be different. Not bad but weirder.<br /><br />Features: Elegant white color, bold ear buds, its like a typically Nokia headset with one of the end longer so as to wrap it around your neck.<br /><br />My Likes: Obviously the look of silvery and white colors. The ends are steel and the entire thing is majorly white, I must say suits iPads.<br /><br />My dislikes:<br />* The Ear nodes are bigger, though does not pain my ear like the original apple ear-pads, but they are hefty, makes the overall wearing experience bit adjusting. You cannot wear them and sleep over listening to music. AT one point of time you have to wake up and remove them and the sleep.<br />* Dissipate most of the sound from the back of the nodes, you might have to hold the back to listen to detailed effects.<br />* I did not expect them to have one loner side, that irritates me. Its just a normal earphone not specifically for iPads<br /><br />Bottom Line: This is what you get in these many nickels.",3,2
The case and screen protector are great.  But the pc cable is junk to me.<br />For people who do not know the nook cable is a special cable and not just any cable will work.,3,2
"This past weekend I had my first chance to give a try. The concept is a great one and I realized my need after a trip to the arctic where multiple battery operated devices failed with time for lack of a plug-in. Going in, however, I could not relate to the figure `1500mAh' for the internal battery. I must say I was sadly disappointed to find that size internal battery only allowed me to charge my smart phone one time before the battery was depleted. Based on experience with other small battery recharges that are capable of recharging multiple devices and/or be used to power a portable computer, this device is sadly lacking. The solar recharge capability is a good one, but with an eight-hour charging time after each device is charged, this device will not meet my recharging needs in the field. Obviously it will be useless in less than sunny conditions after recharging one device one time. I will keep it as an emergency back-up device should a larger primary device be depleted, and hope for sunny conditions to restore it, but I cannot recommend it as a stand-alone backup with such a small internal battery.<br /><br />Great concept, but it is lacking in practicality. A sore disappointment, I am afraid.",3,2
"I had this installed almost exactly eight months ago. The alarm has been great. My problem is with the remotes.<br /><br />My wife and I each have one and they are both cracked and falling apart in only eight months. We do not put these through any sort of extreme conditions either. At this point I am worried that the remote will just stop working one day. That would suck as it has starter disable and I would be stranded. If there is/was some sort of protective skin available I would definitely purchase it as these remotes are VERY fragile.<br /><br />I purchased this through eBay so I contacted the seller first. (Not holding my breath.) If/when that doesn't work I will contact Viper about at least getting some sort of discount on new remotes. (I will update later.)<br /><br />Update 10/17/13: I contacted Viper and the eBay seller. Viper said something along the lines of \\""we don't cover customer abuse\\"". The eBay seller offered a second remote at a (\\""discounted\\"") ~$25. (Half the cost of the entire alarm.) I ended up super gluing the entire remote so it would stay together. When the battery dies I will just have to buy a new remote. Very disappointed.",3,1
"Serves its purpose. Not the best of the bunch,but the price point was worth the purchase. Arrived on time and nicely packaged.",3,1
"meh..if you want a cheap transmitter that works OK, get this product. Don't expect something amazing. The charger that plugs into the car power outlet is made really cheaply and breaks after 2 days. You just can't play/transmit and charge at the same time. You have to have your device charged prior to playing. Also, you have to find a place in your car where the device/transmitter can be placed in order to get good reception and clear sound. I don't know how other brands compare in that respect. This is my first transmitter. Even so, good value (I paid around $5 for it)... it works.  a",3,2
"The jaws on the one I have won't open wide enough to accommodate my Magellan Roadmate 9055.  Is it made wrong?  Am I missing something?  Who knows?  There were zero instructions in the box.  Not that you really need any instructions, but is there supposed to be some way of adjusting it wider to get a 9055 in to it?  I don't know.  Now it WILL hold a cell phone, so I'll give it three stars for that.  Be wary of this device....",3,2
Came early which was a plus. But it doesn't work at all. The port doesn't really fit in my iPhone.. I have to yank it out. When I plugged it in it simply just doesn't charge,3,2
"This is a cute cover for my iPod 4th generation. It is just a plastic shell, nothing more, so don't expect full protection if dropped on ground. I wish the design itself stayed on the white plastic, after a while it turns dark brown from dirty hands and then starts peeling so you see the white plastic underneath. Hard to find decent covers and cases for 4th gen now, but this works.",3,1
a little cheep but for the price its a good deal,3,1
Only complaint is instrctions are in Korean. Had to look for an app to translate other than that product seems good.,3,1
"THIS RADIO IS TRULY NOT A 4 WATT RADIO. IT IS ACTUALLY A 3.5 WATT RADIO. DON'T BE FOOLED BY FALSE CLAIMS. IN ADDITION, THE BUILT-IN SWR IS WORTLESS. IF YOU DECIDE TO BUY THIS RADIO, BUY A SWR TO TUNE YOUR ANTENNA.",3,2
I will let you know how it works once I get back from Elk Hunting in September.  It should be quite a test.,3,1
"Satisfied so far,",3,1
"Is a basic double DIN, the screen quality is ok, the sound quality is really good (powering 4 JBL GTO638) the screen size is the biggest you can get, a lot of inputs and outputs.<br /><br />I don't like the GUI looks like an Atari from the 80's and no way to use a image as a background, you can control an iPod but you need to look to see the iPod's interface to see what you want to play!",3,1
cool toy but the number of things that you can do with it are overstated.  Many of the apps are essentially the same thing and there are not as many as they indicate on the packaging--some are only for andriod vs. mac products.,3,2
It is a nice case but the stand part of it isn't very durable. Itseemed to break off quite easily,3,1
"My LifeDrive rides again thanks to an Oriental no-name brand knock-off battery. It comes with a plastic-handled  star screwdriver, the only one I am aware of on the planet that can unscrew the back off my Palm LifeDrive so I can access the battery. Instructions in Chinglish tell me how to handle and care for the battery, but I have to look up how to install it on YouTube. I recharged the LifeDrive using my plug-in charger, but inadvertently ran down the battery about a half-day after charging while I was transferring my data to my Laptop (something which frankly took a long time and a lot of battery juice). It wouldn't turn back on -- for a while there it looked like it had bricked out on me again. Then, after recharging overnight, my LifeDrive rides again, again!<br /><br />My prediction is that the screwdriver will outlive the LifeDrive, and will never fit any other screw known to Man, ever again! Long after my LifeDrive has given up the ghost, the six-pointed star screws will go the way of cantilever brakes and the BetaMax, only to be replaced by a, a, a what??? a, ... a 7-pointed star screw, that's what!",3,1
"Bought two. One for my wife and one for me. Love the convenience of when they work but too often they fly out of the lighter or slam down on our consoles. They fall out when driving or just slams down in the direction of a turn of the vehicle.     My recommendation is for the engineers or manufacturers to add some type of base (tripod, etc) to anchor or support it and help balance it while it is inserted in the car lighter.    Nice concept but doesn't work very well in practice. 3 stars for trying.",3,1
Product worked great in the beginning then became static while playing. I will try it again today to see if it works. The only downside to this is while driving at night the blue Bluetooth knob is very bright. It would be nice if that would dim.,3,1
The unit looks great. The sound quality is better than the stock radio. I'm still learning the features.<br /><br />The remote control does not work.<br />I haven't been able to get the steering controls to work w/this unit.<br />The touch screen is is very cumbersome.  Hard to change screens.<br />Haven't been able to get the USB to work. It has an automatic mute when in reverse that is ridiculously annoying.  It comes with an external USB & iPod plug since the factory ones will not work with this unit.<br /><br />Overall I'm trying hard to like the unit more because it looks great in my 2013 Toyota Tundra.,3,2
"The quality is okay for the price but it skips words a lot, I constantly take it out and put it back in",3,1
I bought this to listen to my audio books. It's really small and easy to clip almost anywhere.  There is plenty of memory to hold hundreds of books and it will accept a memory card.  Unfortunately the ear buds just will not stay in my ears.  I had to go to an over-the-head style head set and the volume is very poor.  I purchased a booster and now the volume is sufficient in a not to loud environment.,3,2
Sound quality needs improvement. Speaker looks and feels very cheap. I also had a really hard time connecting via bluetooth even though I followed the instructions that came with it. But you get what you pay for.,3,2
"The screws come out of the bottom of the iPhone very easy I've had to tighten them probably every 5 days since getting it. The small hole is very small the attachment I bought did not fit. use caution when purchasing, great idea mininmual follow through",3,1
"Pros:  * Price  * Nice to be able to listen to music without interruption, just loaded a 4GB SD card  * Comes with a remote, which is a necessity, since there are things you can't set with just the device (ie: Equalizer)    Cons:  * Volume output from the device is very low, have to turn the radio way up to get decent volume.  Not good when you decide to go back to a normal radio station.  * Volume output from my MP3 player is even worse than the SD card.  * The device always starts at song #1.  * Does not remember the last FM Frequency.  * Does not remember the last Equalizer setting.  * Equalizer settings are not all that great.    For $10 it's not bad, if you don't mind resetting all the options every time you want to use the device.  Next time, I will definitely look at better alternatives, something that will store all settings, remember the last song and have better volume output.",3,2
"Works as intended, I thought it was the bigger one",3,1
This charger does the trick but you have to get the battery perfectly in place for it to charge.,3,1
"Notice how the specs are rated at 14.4 volts in perfect conditions. No ones car runs at this voltage cleanly and consistently all the time. After you take into account temperature humidity, length of wires, quality of power wire... etc, you get much less.<br />Really your cars alternator puts out 13.0 - 13.8 at best. So in reality your playing this amp at 13.0 - 13.8 volts and sometimes down to 12 volts under heavy loads. So instead of 500 watts your getting about 350w. This amp is overrated, or at least rated at un-realistic expectations.  Also, this amp should not be run under 4 ohms. At 2 ohms it will over heat and shut down. If you match this with a 4ohm sub that's rated about 300-400 watts you'l be happy with it. Very cheap price helps make up for the complaints. If you got the extra cash go for a real amp like a JL 500/1 or 1000/1 who have very reliable performance and consist output across varies voltages and ohms.<br /><br />UPDATE: (July 3, 2013)<br />After having the same model several times and other kenwood models, my opinion still stands. You will get a solid 350-400 watts from this unit so pair a 4ohm subwoofer to that power range.",3,1
"Rather disappointing.<br />Doesn't have a lot of bump, my old 800watt Pyles hit way harder. Go with the Kenwood package, cheaper, better quality",3,2

Average in my opinion its cheaper that some other TomTom models but I had a few problems when I took a detour there was a really long delay while it calculated another route and as far as I can remember when I turned on the GPS and would write down a destination it would load really slow also. Maybe I was too harsh or quick to judge this GPS and quick to buy another GPS. I still have it as backup in case my other one malfunctions.,3,1
"The item was delivered well packaged<br />I installed it in a power supply that I made and it worked well<br />I think that installation instructions should be added, because<br />the labeling on the meter is not clear.",3,1

When charged by the sun, which takes a very long time, it wouldn't give my phone a full charge.<br /><br />It is nice to have though because when your not at your house or a car it is a great way to charge a dying phone battery.. or games.",3,1
doesnt work with 2c and 70cm equipment.  since these are used by many Hams it should be stated on web that they are not applicable for all applications,3,2
"this product barely got 3 stars. It is extremely cheaply made, pretty slow response when making selections. Buttons and switches are loose and overall this product is very flimsy at best. I should have spent $8 more and got a Sandisk or Coby, but those didnt have FM Tuner built in and that is really what I wanted in this type of product. Should have known better....",3,2
"I found this to be not so excellent, but not so bad, it does NOT fit well on my ipod, i thought it was going to be great, it took me an HOUR to put it on, the front looks good, the back not so well. Over all, if you search a lot, you will get a better case than this one",3,1
"This armband works great, except that the band is pretty short. I have fairly small arms and it JUST fits on my arm. So if you are a guy looking at this armband i would recommend not to get this particular one as i don't think it would fit your arm.   The plastic cover allows you to use your phone but is a little stiff.",3,1
"I wasn't happy that it took so long to come in the mail when most of the items i ordered from amazon came within a few days but this took over a week to arrive. Then getting it and trying to find the right memory card for it was impossible. Best Buy suggested going on line because no one sells the expansion card for it at all. That was a big disappointment. I loaded it up with lots of music, videos and a couple of shows only to find out i had to convert the vids because they weren't in the right format when they were all in the right format to begin with. So that was frustrating. But the screen is perfect, the little pen does need a holder but you get around that tucking it into the sleeve it comes with. The quality of the sound is awesome and it holds more music than even i have. My only complaint was the battery just was drained in an hour of playing it, so if you go for long walks or hard workouts, or just clean your house to it, keep a batter charger close by. That's the downer I wasn't expecting.   But for the money, it is totally worth it. I may get one for my son and daughter for Xmas.",3,1
The GPS rattles a little bit. But it seems more secure than original garmin bike mount,3,1
"A little better than I expected,but not much. Seem to work better at lower volume. Unlike other inexpensive earphones, these have not fallen apart within 30 days.",3,2
"****BEGIN UPDATE****  After more experimentation, I've found that this will \\""charge\\"" a powered on Galaxy Tab although VERY VERY slowly.  The battery icon on the tab won't indicate that it is charging, but nonetheless it actually will draw a charge from the battery pack (very very slowly). I would not recommend using it to charge the Tab after it already has a low battery because it draws the charge so slowly.  Instead, I would start using the battery pack while you are actually using the Tab.  So for example if you're going to use the Tab to watch a movie, instead of watching the movie then connecting the battery pack because the battery has drained, you should connect the batter pack while actually watching the movie.  ****END UPDATE****  PROS:  It works well charging small USB devices.  So I used it to charge a myTouch 3g, it charged it from about 12% to 70% at about the same speed I would have expected from a wall charger, but the last 30% seemed to take forever.  It still had plenty of juice left though.  I've charged other cell phones, ipods, MiFis with it, all of those seemed to work great.  CONS:  The trouble arose when I tried to use to charge my [[ASIN:B00519RWI8 Samsung Galaxy Tab (10.1-Inch, 32GB, Wi-Fi)]]; which is the primary reason I purchased the battery (for long airplane flights).  I connected the tablet and the battery/charge icon indicated that it wasn't charging.  So after reading some more amazon reviews, I noticed another reviewer noted that it would only charge his galaxy tablet when he turned the tablet completely off.  I tried this, and found it worked for me as well, but the charging was extremely slow.  Other reviewers have claimed that this battery charges the iPad slower than a wall charger because of the difference in amps. I imagine this is probably the same reason it won't charge the galaxy tab at all while the tab is on. From what I can tell, the galaxy tab charger is 2 amps, whereas I think I've read that the output of this externalbattery is only 1amp.  I have ordered another external battery from a different vendor, despite some of its poor reviews: [[ASIN:B00439G3WS i.Sound Portable Power Max with 16,000 mAh for iPod, iPad, iPad2, iPhone, Droid, and Blackberry]].  It's listed as having an output of 2.5amps.  So we'll see if it works any better with the galaxy tab.  Finally, the power button also had indicator lights \\""high, med, lo\\"", but I've never noticed a change in the indicators.  They are always all on, or all off, but never seem to change indicating the battery level.  I haven't used it very often, so it is possible that I've just missed it every time.",3,2

"PROS:<br />-Device was received after only a few days.<br />-Plays songs to the FM radio rather well.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Remote control only works when pointed directly at the top of the device, where the LCD readout is displayed.<br />-Device does not have a tight hold when plugged in. Constantly slips out of all power ports tested.<br /><br />For the price, I am going to take what I can get... and what I get isn't too bad. I would recommend this device if you want a car FM transmitter and don't want to pay a lot for it. Don't set your expectations too high and you won't be disappointed.",3,2
I was just purely using this for music storage which at 8GB it has a lot of capacity for and I plugged it into my car and away I went.  But there was something faulty with the software that muddled everything up when I went to delete some songs and then put some new ones on there.  It sent error messages to my computer and I could do no more.  So it turned out to be a bust.<br /><br />Now I'm not a tech guy and don't know how stuff like this works so I'm left wondering if it's my fault.  I can say that I was able to navigate awkwardly the menu once I got the hang of it and it worked well in my car until I tried to change things...so take this review with a grain of salt.,3,1
"This case is lovely and very substantial, especially for the price. My only complaint is that it is clearly NOT a Simple Touch case, so much as a one-size-fits-all ereader sleeve.

"You have to squeeze the sliding side grippers quite hard in order for it to hold the phone tight enough so the phone does not slip out.  Because of this, the spring loaded clips that hold it to the vent dislodge and the entire unit can detach from the dashboard.

"I brought this Keylogger (KL) one week ago.  It looks very nice and is as small as you can see in the photos (or even smaller). The construction is very solid and there is not external labels or identification about what is it. No software installation required nor included.  Excellent. <br /> <br />The problems started when I tried to test it in my home's computer.   When I first tried to use the KL with my HP Pavillion computer with a Microsoft Multimedia Keyboard, the KL did not work.  It can't record any keystroke or even run the administration software.  The keyboard works normally, but nothing more happend. My first thought was that the device was damaged.  Only for make sure before to call to tecnical support, or return it, I tried it in my office's computer (HP Vectra with HP Keyboard) and it worked exactly as advertised. <br /> <br />The software includes a option called \\""NETPatrol\\"" which search \\""http\\"", and other \\""interesting\\"" strings inside the captured text.

"I must be honest, I think if you are looking for an everyday radio this is not what you want. It's not terribly easy to use, and has limited range. However, it does work incredibly well for Radio direction finding. I use this radio to find my HPR rockets when they land in tall grass, and it works wonderfully. It is small, extremely lightweight, and cheap enough that I don't really care what happens to it.<br /><br />My only gripe with the radio is the volume, which on the first setting is so incredibly loud my ears bleed.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anybody who is looking for a backup radio or a nice little RDF receiver!",3,1
"hi ... for now I can not comment on this article since it does not and received nothing, but I imagine it is a great product.<br /><br />see you later<br />regards ..",3,2
its alright kind of made cheep but wasnt costley so I cant coplain bought 4 my daughter's tablet Thank You,3,1
"The lavender color of the case was very beautiful, but this was not the same color as the one I received. It was more of a plastic dark hot pink. But I do like the easy to handle design and it is very durable.",3,1
The description is confusing.  They should separate the two styles.  One is a flip and has the stand.  The other is a side opening and does not have a stand.   I did not realize this till just now when I was going to watch something on my itouch.  It is to late to send back because I threw out the box and other papers.,3,2
"You get what you pay for. If you're looking for a heavy-duty case this is not your best bet, however it serves my purposes just fine. It did take a long time to ship though, and I can't use headphones while the phone is in the case.",3,1
I chose this product for protecting the front and back of the iTouch.  I like the look and the protection.  I have bought a frogz boost to enhance the volume of the iTouch.  When I have the cover on and use the boost the sound is reduced and/or crackles.  The thing in which I'm most disappointed is that there is no opening for either the charger or camera.  So to use either you must remove the iTouch  from the cover.  The good news is that it is easy to remove since you will be charging regularly.,3,1
"We bought this for my 6 year old daughter to protect against bumps and drops. Unfortunately, every time she bumps or drops the ipod the cover pops off. At first, I thought maybe I wasn't getting it snapped together completely. I took time to make sure it snapped all the way around, and it still popped off the next time she dropped it. It was cheap, so I guess you get what you pay for, but if you are looking at this for a child that is more prone to dropping things, go ahead and spend a little extra money and get something that works. If it's being bought for an adult that isn't as likely to drop it, it will probably be fine.",3,2
"The battery life could be longer, I only get about 3 hours after it's fully charged. Other than that, I'm happy with it.",3,1
"doesn't fit in all sockets.  worked in an older GMC, that was a cigarette lighter, but won't fit in sockets i have on newer vehicles that the sockets are labeled as power outlet.",3,2
She loved it,3,1
I didn't really like the case because i didn't feel that it gripped my itouch very well.  I gave it to my dad to use on his Itouch.  He is very happy with it.  If you are kind of rough on your device i would NOT recommend this case but other wise it is a very nice case and worth the money.,3,1
"My unit came with gaps along either side of the flip out screen, indicating it had been opened.  There is also a piece of very sticky film over a corner of the display, which coincidentally always displays a red bar.  It clearly wasn't in the new condition that was promised.  Otherwise, it works (at least as well as other reviewers indicated) and I didn't buy it for the display, so I guess I'll use it until it breaks.  The video is pretty crappy, even on the HD setting.  I had to turn off the auto white balance because everything came out so dark except when the sun was behind the vehicle.",3,2
The case was cute but the black pattern wore off after a few weeks.,3,2
This headlamp works well on camping trips when you need to have hands free for other activities.  The white light is bright for easy visibility in the dark.  The red light option is especially good when you are entering/leaving a tent and don't want to disturb your fellow bedmates.,3,1
"This has been a great charger ,  a real  life saver at times , unfortunately the charging cable broke a couple of days back and now it lies unused. i am unable to charge it thru a usb -usb cable .<br /><br />Cant seem to find any place on the net where i can find the replacement charging cord.<br /><br />Can anyone suggest from where to obtain the chord...<br /><br />Thanks",3,1
"The film is flimsy and difficult to install.  Also, the film causes a glare and makes it difficult to see the screen.  I removed the film after one ride.",3,2
"This is my second BlueAnt. My wife uses the older Supertooth. I've had this S4 for over a month now.    The Good:  They are as loud a unit as I've seen. So in a noisy vehicle, they're not bad.  Batteries last forever. If you turn it off when you leave the car, you'll get a good week out of it with medium use.    The Bad:  The unit was scratched out of the box. It didn't have a protective cover over the shinny face.  I bought it here at Amazon, it was sold thru Accessory One. The entire box was wrapped in plastic. Looks like it was a used or refurbed unit.    I have the Droid X, with the latest Android 2.2. It will not upload the phone books. Yes, I've read the manual and have followed the steps to the letter. And yes, I have the latest firmware installed. As I write this, it's been saying \\""Transfering contacts, please wait\\"" for the last 20 minutes! I've spent hours resetting the S4 and starting all over trying to get this to work. Every time, it just sits there saying the same thing. I've let it do this for as long as 3 hours.  So don't plan on it announcing anything more than the phone number when you get an incoming call.    When returning to the car or when turning it on, it will say, \\""Hands free trigger is enabled\\"". Well, not quite. If my Droid X is in standby--which naturally it is if it's in the belt holster--I have to take it out an wake it up first. THEN the S4 will be in hands free trigger mode.    Note: As I write this, I just powered down the S4 since it was hung in contact transfer mode. After turning it back on, it wouldn't connect to my Droid X. I had to go into the Droid X's menu and force it to connect.    BlueAnt's web site says: \\""We pride ourselves on developing high performance, cutting edge products that are easy to use and work straight out of the box.\\""  --------Not quite in my experience.  Your mileage may vary and you may be lucky enough to get it work, but just plan on a loud plane jane speaker box--just in case.",3,2
I sent it back,3,1
"The first time I tried to open the case, the zipper was stuck on the corner and would not move.  I finally got it free after working with it for about 5 minutes.  But every time I open or close it, it gets hung up on the same spot, and it takes a little manuvering to get the zipper to keep going.  I've only had it for about a month, so hopefully the zipper won't break. It's also a tight fit for my Garmin, but it is workable.  I like the protection from the hard case.  Considering the great price, I would say overall that this is a good value.",3,1
It's a nice case just for carrying the garmin itself no other room for storage but it is compact and easy to carry around,3,1
"Pros:  - Solid fit and finish. Fits the Vado HD well (fit is quite snug, so the silicone skin won't work if you plan use this holster)  - Nice materials. Leather? Leatherette? Feels good and would not be out of place with businesswear. Good quality magnetic clasp.    Cons:  -I purchased this case while in Afghanistan to haul my Vado HD around beltside. The bottom connector on the belt clip broke after about two weeks' use.   -I WAS using the case for a purpose it was NOT designed for (very harsh conditions).  Recommended for normal conditions.   -Does not protect Vado from the elements. Top corners of the camcorder are exposed.    Bottom Line: Nicely made, inexpensive case for normal use. Pick something tougher if you are taking your Vado into the wild.",3,1
Camera will never have an accurate date and time. Always appears to be off after a few hours. Camera sags slights over time. Decent camera for the price though,3,1
Do not purchase the GTMax Home Travel Charger for Sandisk Sansa Clip Plus that Amazon offers as a buy together option.  The Travel Charger does not fit the Clip Zip 8 GB MP3 player.,3,2
Was a bit difficult to get the menus over to English. Since they start out in another language you have to go in and change the language to English but you can't read the menu's to know where to go to do it.<br /><br />Video quality wasn't good. It wasn't incredibly bad but was not HD.<br /><br />OK for the price,3,2
"Sony MDRZX100 Black Headphones, by Sony.<br />These inexpensive, closed, 30mm dome headphones are a bit shrill, and unless you have some tone controls available, the bass is minimal at best. Forget up-front thumping bass, -as even with your bass controls cranked up, the bass is barely adequate. These headphones are not very good with music sources that don't have bass tone controls, -like your basic computer. On a Sony CMT-EP505 MICRO HI-FI, I had to use the ROCK setting to cut some of the highly directional shrillness of the POP setting, and I had to press MEGABASS to get adequate bass response. The sad part is that the bass is very clean when boosted, but you have to be able to boost it. In rating these headphones, I give the sound a rating of 4 out of 5 stars. The design gets a rating of 3, as the clamping pressure cannot be relieved by bending the plastic headband outward, just above the ear cups. The poorly designed bass response was also taken into consideration. The ear pads, with the sprayed on finish on top of foam, can get a bit sweaty after a while. To lessen the clamping pressure, I extended the headband as far as possible, and added a bit of padding (6\\"" of 3/8\\"" thick, 1\\"" inside diameter self sealing foam pipe insulation) at the top of the headband. Headband pads can be bought, but the hot water pipe insulation was all I had available at the time. I suppose that I could have sacrificed an old wool skating sock, with the end cut off, and folded halfway inside out, to do the same thing. Without the added padding, all you can do is move the ear cups lower on your ears. The construction rates a 4 due to the limitations of the adjustable plastic headband. I also wish that there was an option to change the on-ear pads to large or extra large around the ear pads, as your head can handle long term clamping pressure better than the folds of your ears can handle it. Comfort gets a rating of 4, tied into the issues of small sweaty pads, and a plastic headband that cannot be bent outward above the ear cups to relieve the clamping pressure, without breaking the headband completely. With the padding, the comfort was acceptable. Thankfully, the headphones are light in weight at 4.23 ounces exclusive of the cord. Adding the ratings, we get a rating of 15 out of a possible 20, or 75%, a score of \\""C\\"", and three stars overall. Are they worth buying? At the price of fifteen dollars, yes, but you have to adjust to them and work around their limitations. Please, do not blame the messenger. I always tell it like it is, the bad along with the good.

The only reason I give this a 3 is that BaoFeng does not have a car battery charger..... WTF?,3,2
probably would have been an ok product had my daughter ordered the right one. this is for a different product!,3,2
"It works.  However, it does not fit in the socket well enough, so when you hit a bump in the road, it will have an interruption in power causing it to restart and re-pair to your device.  Your device will continue to play, however, while it re-pairs to the device.  It is frustrating that it doesn't fit better in the receptacle.<br />For your information when using, if you leave it on when you turn off your car, it will restart and pair without you knowing it.  If you had turned your radio off or to a different station, you device will begin playing and you won't know it till later when you wonder why your audio book is three chapters forward of where you last listened.",3,2
"I was surprised by the quality of sound that it gives, BUT the downside is the on and off twisting switch, that was a big mistake! It is so difficult to deal with, I bought 10 of these and gave out 9 of it as a gift last Christmas, So for those people who received one from me, I just advised them to leave this switch on and just remove the batteries instead.  It's easier that way.",3,1
Product works good with my iPod but is not for an iPad which I thought it did.<br />The pice is right and it works.,3,1
"Rattling noise inside camera, video works great",3,1
"The ZVUE is good except that it doesn't come with much space for music and the media cards are expensive so if you're looking to put more than 60 songs on this you're out of luck! (And that's ONLY if you have no videos on it... just one 3 minute music video cut my music time in half!) The screen is big for an mp3 player but the quality isn't that great (think of watching tv with an old fashioned bunny ear antenna, no cable or satellite, that's the video and picture quality). As for battery life it says it lasts \\""for hours\\"" but mine barely made it through an hour and a half! I would throw mine away but then I'd feel guilty cuz my Mom got it for me for Christmas! I'll give it a year for her sake but then I'm buying a different one!",3,2
"I guess my problem is, I live in the mountains and getting anything to work in my area is a challenge. Cell phones included. I've tried other devices, even satellite radio but nothing really seems to do the job. The good news is that I did not pay a lot for this transmitter. It works great with my IPod when I'm on flat land but they so does my radio. If you live in the mountains, you drive a lot with no music.",3,1

"I was a little concerned when a package arrived with Chinese packaging, but overall the product looked good.  Other customers are right in the fact that it fits the iPhone, but it is a little too tight and you do worry about messing up the phone.  Mine does actually work though, so i am less worried on that front.  The only other thing that i can't vouch for is whether or not the power supply is correct.  Of course i chose the much cheaper option than buying the original product from Apple.  If the battery life decreases on the iPhone i will update the review, otherwise it is a much less expensive version of a charger than sold in stores!",3,1
"This one is very good, this clip is very usefull in the gym and even just anywhere, but i need to push a little hard on those side buttons.",3,1
"I have bought several fm transmitters for myself and family members.  This one is better than the Belkin TuneCast but not as good as the iRiver (at least in my area in Northern California).  I tried all of the suggested frequencies but I do pick up some noise from the ignition during acceleration.  I listen to a lot of classical music so I do notice the interference.  For other music genres, it shouldn't matter.  Once at speed on the road, the music sounds great.",3,1
This radio could be improved if they would sell 4 strand marine grade wire to facilate hooking to the necessary gps. I spent several days trying to find something suitable to no avail.,3,2
I like this product but for some reason it was disconnecting while in route.  This was the only reason I returned this product but my friend who bought an older version of DOD has never complained.,3,2
"The black one still works great but the white one already doesn't work, it's only been a couple months. I would still buy again in hopes they both work good",3,2
"I find that it starts to pull away from the ipod (it seems *a bit* too small), but I like that it allows unobstructed access to the plug port.<br /><br />Cute design & good enough quality for the price.",3,1
"The product looks great in the picture.  Upon opening my package from Minisuit, I was immediately disappointed, though.    The case is very light-weight, which in and of itself, isn't bad.  However, it feels really cheap, especially the plastic notches that help hold the two pieces of the case together.  The back \\""latch\\"" doesn't really add any stability to the case itself.  My case does stay on my iPod, but I feel like I need to constantly press the two pieces of the case together to make sure it's still holding on to my iPod solidly.  I'm sure if I dropped it, that the case would fall apart and that there would be damage done to my iPod.    That said, the case does look great on my iPod - I really like the way it looks, which is too bad.  I bought a different case shortly afterward to make sure my iPod would be fully protected because I transport it to and from campus all the time and I definitely want to make sure it won't break when it drops.    In addition, a \\""screen protector\\"" did come with the case, however it was really cheap looking (really ragged edges) and I really didn't want it sticking to my iPod's screen.    If you're not concerned about dropping your iPod, then the case does look great, but I would say you should probably look elsewhere for a better product.",3,2

"Overall it was a good combo and it works nicely. My only problems are that you have you turn the bass control all the way down when before you take the key put of the Ignition otherwise there's an annoying feedback sound, and the power wired is kinda small but it runs the amp, if you got anything bigger you would have to replace it because the wire can only handle 600 watts max. One last thing it says its an 800 watt amp but its not it's more like 250watts amp.",3,1
I have mine mounted on the back porch. With a dry finger it takes a few tries to get it to work. Mainly because when you scan your finger you have a start point and end point. If you dont get the start point correct then you have to do it again.<br />Also if your finger is wet for any reason it wont work. Not due to the water but due to the fact your figerprint changes.  Wash your car and you cant shut your garage door.<br />I like it but you have to be willing to give it a few tries to get your door opened. I think the most tries was 7 with a dry finger. Sometimes one try.  I have had it for two years now.,3,2
Much better than the apple!,3,1
"The speaker has good sound, but it resets the volume to the loudest setting.  So, you have to keep press the volume control until you set the volume to what you want.",3,1
It is a little bit smaller than the ipad,3,1
"The mirror part is cool, and so is the screen protecting part.  The bad part is that it is hard to see the screen when you are out in the sun and you almost always have to have the brightness all the way up.",3,1
"Quality: generally good, the cigarette lighter plug wire is cheep though and fails the quality test.<br />Useability: Southern California has a lot of radio stations so I had to take the antennae of my truck for this to work well.<br />Recommend: maybe, it does work but I finally just got myself a better stereo that I can plug things into.",3,1
"I rated this three stars because the large sticky pad that goes on the dashboard does not really stick to the dashboard, especially if your dashboard does not have a smooth surface. I had to fasten it down with auto velcro strip. I do love the large sticky pads that the phone or gps lay on. My smartphone does stick to the sticky pads even on sharp turns. I like the easiness of just placing my phone on the pad and not having to insert it to a holder.",3,2
"The description states that it will play re-recordable CD's and was one of the reasons that I bought it, unfortunately it WON'T. I ended up paying for not for great speakers for my iPOD. I would not buy this product again",3,2
"It was difficult to apply and it covered up most of the touch screen, which really annoyed me for some reason.  I couldn't seem to get the front sticker on straight so it just ended up either sticking to itself, or crooked.  I'm somewhat of a perfectionist so I just ended up cutting out the brances outline (placing them precariously on the front of my Nook) and keeping the back sticker.  The free screensaver was really cute though!",3,2
"It didst quite fit my MP3 well, but it worked well enough.",3,1
"The cover is rigid plastic, the outside looks nice.  Sparkly spots and almost feels...fabricy? It snaps onto the iPod fine, but I feel it is not quite deep enough, it barely makes it around the edges.  Stayed on, but looks a bit ill-fitting. I tried it on my 4th Gen iPod but the power button is not in the right spot for the case.",3,2
"This product sure has a lot of features.  However, it is hard to understand just how to make the thing function correctly.  The problem lies in the instructions which are very confusing and must have been proofread by a first grader.  The suction cup attachment is outstanding....it really holds the unit in place securely.  The flip down screen is really neat because you can see exactly what you are videotaping.  When I figure out how to use it I will update my review.",3,1
"A very basic amp, and I'm surprised it is considered even 100 watts.  It puts out less sound than the shelf radio it is replacing.  One positive is that I've had this for about two months and so far it has not caught fire or shorted out like the other PYLE amplifiers reviewed on here.",3,1
limited use.  Works on limited makes.  Can be hard to figure it out base on your modle/make.  Codes not intuitive.,3,2
"Having a dash cam is pretty much a necessity lately, whether you're using it for insurance purposes, monitoring police checkpoints and arguing constitutional rights, or trying to record cross country trips, they are extremely useful.  I bought this dash cam 4 months ago and have nothing but praise for it.<br /><br />I do not understand why this Dash Cam has received so many mixed reviews.  If the card is filling up and failing, it's because you're using the wrong SD card.  I started out using a class 10 card and it didn't work at all.  I had a 32GB card that was working great until I lost it and am now using a 16GB card.  The card fills up about 4 hours of 3 minute loops in individual folders before it starts recording over them, plenty of time to stop the camera and save whatever information you wish to retain.<br /><br />The video quality is not full 1920x1280 HD but it displays a very clear picture during the day while the night shots are clear enough to make out license plates from a few car lengths back.  If you want pure HD, go spend $500 and get an HD camera, if you want to prove your innocence get this cam for $40 (camera + a 16gb card) and save yourself immense headaches.  Beyond the price, the menu options are straight forward and easy to navigate and it looks pretty beastly mounted to the dash (quick install tip, push the power cable below the steering column, through the air vents, and around the windshield to avoid having a cable dropping from the rearview).<br /><br />Edit 11/28/14 - The unit finally died - about 18 months of use",3,2
"These things are hit or miss. My wife has had her same one for years and I am getting ready to buy my 3rd replacement. I am the one who keeps my car parked in a garage as well. They are inexpensive but I would rather pay a little more for a better build. Just take your chance and see what you get, thats all you can do.",3,1
"The wall charger is in fact from apple but the USB, yeah, that one is not. But it is alright I mean a couple weeks later it is still good. It works no scratches or anything. It was a good buy and I don't plan on buying another one just because the USB is not from apple. Buy it. Its worth it.",3,2
"I wired these bad boys in last weekend.  I wasn't expecting to be blown out of the water for $40 bones and needless to say I wasn't either.  I have an Alpine mrp-f300 running them, it took some devotion into wiring these suckers.  I found out the hard way that you want to run the speaker wires opposite of the power wire going to the trunk.  Should have read up more on it.  I think next time I will splurge and buy the alpine type r component equivalent for roughly $150.  Not out top much I guess since I have the task of wiring my car done.  I suppose I should mention I also run two alpine type r, model 1243, wired 4 ohms until I get my greasy mitts on 1 ohm stable amp, powered by an alpine mrp-m1000 mono amp.  Maybe the woofers drown them out, who knows?  I hate to knock them to bad because it all comes in a nice kit.  Such as, the wires were long enough to reach my truck, the tweeter wires come with pre-crimped male and female spade terminals and a plenty of mounting hardware.  Also comes with foam ring and cut out template but I'm more of a factory look guy anyways so I keep factory speaker covers.  All in all, glad its wired up, but kick myself for not going with alpine.  As for the buying, got what I ordered in described condition.",3,1
"I bought this little stereo because it met all my criteria: a bookshelf radio / CD system that actually looked good and didn't cost much (I'm way behind the times and don't have an Ipod, but it's nice that it has a dock if I ever do get one).  For the most part I've been very happy with it--the sound is nice and fills my small apartment, and it's easy to use and has a simple, convenient remote.<br /><br />My one complaint is that the CD mechanism must be a little cheap, because once in a while a CD will skip that did not skip on my previous player.  However, this is just infrequent enough (maybe one skip for every 2-3 hours of playing time?) that it's not worth it for me to return it and hunt for another player.",3,1
My wife picked this and I ended up buying it. It looks alright but doesn't look like it doesn't offer much protection - just looks.,3,2
"It would have been great had I not been trying to use it to extend the dock of my iphone 5 with a lifeproof case to connect to an older Bose Sound dock. It was not extending far enough to allow the door of the lifeproof case to be clear of the base. However, problem solved. Got a Scosche passPORT Charging Adapter for iPod and iPhone and used Mpow® Bluetooth A2DP Music Audio Receiver Adapter for Bose Sounddock and 30-Pin iPod iPhone Dock Speaker together and it all worked. The seller helped me work all this out and was super helpful in resolving the problem.",3,1
"This case is handsome and well made. It keeps the phone very snug and has three slots for credit or id cards, and one pocket for an SD card and one pocket for a microSD card. The detachable belt clip is a bit large and felt to fragile for my taste. I prefer to remove the detachable belt clip holder from the case and just stick it in my bag or back pocket. It's nice to have the phone protection, and just flip open the cover rather than pulling the phone out of a standard phone case. It has openings for access to all the droid x's buttons, inputs, and camera lens (except for the power button, which is covered when the cover is closed). The cover itself secures with a button/magnet combo which works fine and comes off easily and quick. The main problem with this case is that it blocks the Notification Panel at the top of the phone, where you can't quickly check missed messages and calls. It's one of the cool things about this phone, so I can't highly recommend this case. To me a phone case shouldn't interfere with the phone's key features.",3,1
It's was a little bit complicated to understand how it works since there is no instruction manual with it but you will get use to it pretty quickly if you use it at least everyday. so far i have no complaint for it. I can say that i like it and i would recommend it as a gift for a child ro someone you know that just want something that can play some music.,3,1

"Overall good product.  Bought this to connect my iPad 2 to my Bose Sounddock.  Audio works great, still allows you to use remote for the Bose Sounddock, even streaming audio through Pandora.  The one thing it doesn't do is charge the iPad 2 when connected to the Sounddock.  I connected the cord to my iPod Classic and worked perfectly.  Charged the iPod just like it is supposed to and had full function of the Bose remote as well.  I guess there are differences between the iPad 2 and iPod when it comes to charging even the cords/ports on the devices look identical.",3,1
"weak, small magnet, but seems to hold onto the roof of my car.<br />Thin cable, no idea how much loss I am getting.<br />Use does improve car to car communication, however",3,2
"The main problem is that this item caused an unnecessary trip to the car dealer for vehicle repair. As it turns out, the camera emits enough stray RF that it can cause tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) failure messages in newer cars. Through the same stray RF, it can also significantly reduce the range of key fobs. An online search will show others with similar issues. Unplugging the unit fixed the car. ugh.<br /><br />Ok--putting that aside, the camera is rather large, and the suction cup mount is just as big. It needs to be mounted high for unobstructed view. It takes a lot of windshield real-estate, so it really needs to be mounted behind the rearview mirror (which is where some cars hide their TPMS/key fob receivers).<br /><br />The cord is significantly long enough to route around the perimeter of the windshield. The camera has menus is English which are easy enough to understand and navigate. Video quality is very good, and the lens provides adequate coverage to the sides. The pull-down color viewfinder is nice for assuring alignment, but is too small for readable text while moving (ok for setup though).<br /><br />Overall ok for the price.",3,1
I gave my ipod to my granddaughter for Christmas. I ordered this because it was cheap and because it was pink. I included my old hardshell black cover in case she wanted it.  She liked the pink one.  The wristband I tossed in the trash.  I had no problem with the shipping.,3,1
It didn't say that it had a tacky cord that would hang out,3,1
was a bit hard to get on straight and with no bubbles I think because it was such a large area to cover.  It does what it says it will do and works great in that area.  shipping was OK took a bit but was reasonable. would buy this product again.,3,1
"The only thing I really like is the remote feature on this product.  I can't get the device to charge my Touch, and with my iPod, it has to be laying on my seat to actually charge.  It does however play well.  I don't have a long car ride but it would be nice if the device actually did charge without having to jiggle the cords",3,1
"I bought this product because I needed ExpressScribe for a class I'm taking. The description of this product said it had ExpressScribe included, and my instructor said this would work. However, after using the ExpressScribe for a couple of weeks, I received a message that my &#34;trial period&#34; was over, and I had to go to the NCH website and purchase the ExpressScribe (for about $30.00). Maybe I missed the warning telling me this was a &#34;trial&#34; product when I uploaded the ExpressScribe from this product, but I don't remember seeing anything telling me it wasn't the full version.<br />Needless to say, I paid a lot of money for this Software Dictation Suite, and it didn't really include the item I needed the most, and I had to spend more money to get that product, so I was highly disappointed.",3,2
Connection is easy but its sound is not big enough. Sound is not clear and very bad when I turn my Phone's volume to maximum,3,2
"The Product is great. It keeps my Nook safe and protected. The cover is light weight and durable. The only issue I have with it, was that I searched &#34;orange&#34; and it looked orange from the picture but it was certainly NOT orange. It was more of a brown sienna color.",3,1
"While we were able to replace the original power cord with a generic adapter, it did not have the traffic signal pickup.  The replacement part works, but it is expensive.",3,1
The devices i connect to this adapter are not to secure they slip out easily but it helps me get the job done. The usb side has never worked.,3,1
"It fits in a Lifeproof case with the door bent slightly open.  But it came with the plastic shell not on square and not fully glued together.  I have been using it for a few months and it has held up, but I am being very careful with it.  If I had to order this again I would go with a cable version.  Primarily because the phone is not stable when it sits an inch above the dock in my Bose which was designed to cradle it and give it support across the bottom.  That is a very shakey situation....it would be better to just set the phone flat on the counter beside the unit and be able to hold it in your hand when operating the screen.",3,2
"I've owned an iShower since they were first introduced. Now after a few months of owning it, the unit is failing. It also developed a crack/split across the front of the unit, even though it has never been dropped. I've put up with it for a while, figuring iDevices is going to likely accuse me of dropping or damaging it, but now it's across the entire unit.<br /><br />Battery life is horrid. I usually use this speaker as I'm getting ready in the morning (during shower, shave, getting dressed, approx 30-40 mins). I then turn it off and it doesn't get used till the next day for the same routine. After changing the batteries, after 2 days I get the \\""Lo Batt\\"" warning on the device display. 2 days with new batteries! You will go through a lot of batteries with this thing. I've since switched to rechargeables and the result hasn't been much better.<br /><br />As far as quality of the sound produced, it's pretty good. I usually stream videos of newscasts & podcasts to this thing and I can hear it clearly 2 rooms away.<br />The clock is worthless. Every time you change the batteries (which is often), you'll be resetting the clock. So I don't even bother setting it anymore.<br />Connecting to it is pretty easy and you can connect up to 5 devices. Overall, not a good experience on this device. I've also used a Jawbone Jambox and will likely replace this iShower with one of those.",3,1
"Overall this product functions well - my gripe is that the battery on the mouse must be charged at all times. It looses its charge within a day if not left charging overnight. but I use it for controlling a pc attached to a 50\\"" plasma so i can sit back and control it. Keyboard is fine - but also will kill its batteries if left unused for a while (no built in rechargeables )",3,1
It does its job to protect the GPS.  It does not hold the GPS tight.  I like  the Garmin's case more.,3,1
"I really like it, but it didn't last long for me, before it broke. Also, it is a sticker on a case.",3,2
"I use this with my t-mobile dash and it works well. Was a bugger to get setup with google maps but it will work.     Takes a while to get an initial lock on, especially if your are in a moving vehicle; but once locked on all is well.",3,1
"I bought this case as a more reasonably priced alternative to the iFrogz case for my new iPod Touch.  While I am reasonably satisfied, there are a few concerns that I have about the product.      The case is very attractive -- the black and red contrast really pops.  It is a hard case but has a rubberized, almost silky texture that is very pleasant to touch.  I have access to all the external buttons on the iPod.  I don't have a dock or external speakers yet, so I can't speak to how it would fit.      My primary problem with the case though, is that it does feel somewhat flimsy -- it is a slider case in 2 pieces, and they don't seem to have all that much resistance to coming apart.  I've actually knocked the pieces apart simply plugging or unplugging the headphones if I jostle it too much.  That makes me extremely nervous for how well it would hold up if I were rougher on it -- right now it primarily just goes between the car and the house, but I'm not sure how much real protection it would provide if I were to drop it on a hard surface or if it were getting jostled around in a backpack or purse.    So if you are pretty easy on your iPod and simply need a pretty case to provide basic scratch protection, this is definitely a reasonable alternative, especially at the $6 price I bought it at.  However, if you are looking for more rugged protection, I would probably look elsewhere.    Update 2/20/10: Well that flimsy feeling has been confirmed -- not sure when/how it happened, but a piece broke off the case somehow, at the bottom by where the dock and headphone jack are.  Like I said, I don't even know how it happened, and there's been no especially rough treatment.  It still protects the iPod, but still -- not a good sign. I'll probably spend the extra few bucks to get either the iFrogz case or even a one piece silicone case. I love the look and texture of this case, but ultimately the primary job is to protect my expensive gadget, and I don't have much confidence thatit will do a great job with that. Downgraded to 3 stars.",3,1
Nice package. The only problem was that the car charger does NOT work with my new IPhone 3GS,3,1
"Will not charge the phone , other than that works great . Barely any static at all and it's cheap",3,2
small but powerful. came on time and easy to use.,3,1
Really good but it doesn't  tell if it detects a wireless bug or wireless WiFi or etc  it's just shows the signal strength but other than that works good,3,1
"I know, you get what you pay for, but having bought several of these in order<br />to have extras around the house, I think we have a pretty good reference to how<br />well they work. The store-bought, brand name charger cables work flawlessly,<br />but are SO much more expensive. If you don't mind a bit of unreliability, these<br />are the way to go.",3,1
"It works but . . . receiver has to be manually switched to channel one each time you start your car/turn on the device. Once out of reverse, screen goes wild, i.e., no signal so it's like a TV without reception until you put the car back in reverse or turn the power switch off.  Installation instructions are are not provided so you have to wing it . . .  If there's product support I'm not aware of it.",3,2
because it charged my ipod even thoe I got mad at my ipod and sold it it did the job well done,3,1
"First off, when received I had to put it back together!  The decals and LED readout cover had come off and needed put back in place.  No big deal, but a nuisance.  Second, I get interference...on all frequencies!  When I turn it on and tune my radio to the desired frequency it is perfectly quite.  As soon as I plug in my iPhone 4, I get a low hum/buzzing noise.  When I play music, you don't really hear this background noise unless you are cranking the stereo, but if you do, be prepared for distortion.  The device can't handle low base frequencies and really makes some music sound like I'm going through a long tunnel where the radio station looses signal.  Overall, it's okay, but if you want a better sound quality, you'll have to go with a \\""hard-wired\\"" product and not something that works through FM transmission.",3,1
"Excellent product however was not able to use the code provided for &#34;lifetime map updates&#34; the site kept saying that code had already been used, I gather that since it was a &#34;refurbished&#34; item the previous owner used it",3,1
"They work and they're cheap. That's about as much as I'll give these. The battery doesn't run very long, maybe an hour or so. No battery indicator, just a blinking red light to show it's turned on. Also no indicator to tell if it's full charged. There's no lock to prevent accidental button pushing, but that's hardly an issue since you just clip this on somewhere you won't be hitting.<br /><br />Plastic material cover, not aluminium. This is not an ipod. Plastic is cheap, lightweight, and resilient. It requires NO special software (iTunes) or licenses for your music or cryptic file conversion bullcrap. Just dump your mp3 from your computer, Windows or Linux, using a file explorer, on to a microSDCard and slap it in the player, you can even put them in folders, no problem.<br /><br />Good for half hour workouts. Unobtrusive. Lightweight. Small Size. No problems with music quality, comes out perfectly (with good headphones, not the crap that comes with it). Not complicated. So small and lightweight sometimes I forget it's there and end up tossing it in the laundry hamper clipped to my shirt. I recommend using or buying your own headphones though. The ones that come with it are crap. The sound quality is completely dependent on the headphones, not the player unit.<br /><br />Planning to get another similar one with an LCD window so I can see, search, and select easier. The one major drawback of this simple model is there is no display panel, so you can only go forward and back to select songs and you can't see any lists.",3,2
awesome,3,1
"This piece looks great and is very close to what I needed. I have an '05 ML500 and the keys are pretty beat up...in fact the dog chewed one so badly that the red rubber panic button was completely gone and the operating button window was chewed thru to the pc board but it still worked...when I received this Fob Shell I thought I could use it as it was but The key was a different blank and my key would not fit the new Fob. So I took the Red Panic button and the Operating Button out of the new fob and replaced them in my old fob, a bit kluge but it worked for me.  It was a much cheaper fix in this case but obviously would not work for everyone.  I didn't have to spend $300 from Mercedes Benz for an old car ..I would suggest you check out this piece a bit more if possible if you think you can just use it as a simple replacement.",3,1
"[[VIDEOID:mo328WR9DUG4IA4]]The video was originally 1080p, now it's much worse... I purchased this from T&J WORLD. Alright, first off, the manual is pretty much useless. It took me a while to figure out how to change the language to English. You can get to the menu by plugging directly into the unit instead of the mount. Once it powers on it will give you 3 options. The top option will allow your computer to read the memory, middle option shows the charge status of the battery, and the third option allows you to change the options and review the videos you have made. Anyhow, you can figure it out if you play around with it. When I use it, I usually mount it and plug in directly to the camera rather than plug into the mount. This is because the plug that came with it won't stay in the power port on my 2006 silverado, then again I have similar issues with all other plugs, just not as bad. Instead I plug it into a [[ASIN:B003PU01M4 Kensington PowerBolt Duo Car Charger for iPhone 4/4S]] and directly into the camera (not into the base). The memory I'm using with it is [[ASIN:B009SK58IM Samsung Electronics 32GB High Speed microSDHC Class 6 Memory Card (MB-MSBGB/AM)]], you can record a little over 7 hours with 32 GB. As for the status light beside the &#34;Record/ok&#34; button, I'm not really sure exactly what it means. It has two lights, one red and one blue. I know when the blue light flashes it's recording. I don't know exactly what causes the red light to come on; supposedly it's to show the camera is charging. When I make it record with a full battery the screen is on and blue light blinks, but after the screen shuts off (I have it set to shut off after 1 min) the red lights starts to flash a little and the blue light keeps blinking, I'm not sure why the red light will come on...I would assume the battery wouldn't drain much since the screen is off. To recap: Red on - charging Red off - charged blue blinking - recording I have motion detection off (haven't tested it), IR LED off (they are useless), recycle time 10 min (it makes it start a new file after 10 min), LCD off in 1 min, g sensor no (haven't tested it), gps yes (seems really accurate for the most part). The GPS appears to be in the window mount so you won't get a connection unless the camera is on the mount. The camera does get rather warm but if you have it shut the display off it is maybe a tad cooler. So far I have recorded 4 hours of constant video with no freezes and no other problems. The speed displays in km/h and can't be changed.  I have not even tried to use the software that comes with it, instead I suggest leaving that in the box and finding Registrator Viewer software, it works great and is free!  There are some issues other people have been having, like the pins not contacting properly between the camera and mount causing it not to charge properly and shut off randomly (when plugging into the mount) and/or not have good GPS reception. I saw a Russian site discussing how to resolve that issue using the spring from a Bic lighter or tin foil. Those issues are reported to happen after a bit of use. I haven't personally run into those issues yet.  Update 4-19-2014 They seem to have changed the picture for the product, unlike the current picture that has blue on it, mine is all black. I've recently noticed that the memory card seems to not seat right sometimes or something, because it will only record a short time before it automagically stops. I have to re-seat the memory card and it will start working normally again. This happens after I take the memory card out to download the videos to my computer. I've also ordered a new cord for it as the old one was starting to have issues, I got the [[ASIN:B001TH7GUK AmazonBasics  USB 2.0 A-Male to Mini-B Cable (6 Feet / 1.8 Meters)]] After 10 months it's still working.  Update 12-14-2015 After one final fall off the window it quit working around September 17 2014.",3,2
"Fits the iTouch 4th Gen well and looks nice.  Not really made for high impact, good for dropping on the table or increasing grip.  Some slightly rough edges but not objectionable.     Biggest problem is the iPod charger will not connect with the cover in place, I have to pull the lower edge off to charge the iTouch.  Kind of annoying, I may end up cutting the lower rim out or trying another cover.    Price was cheap and shipping quick.  I may test out Minisuit's customer service on this one.",3,1
"I recently purchased this Arduino RTC device, but not one lick of documentation was included.

This unit works ok.  I have a lot of static while driving.  It's not to the point where its unbearable but its defintily noticable.,3,2
I purchased this to use to monitor the load on a trailer that I pull. Its what I expect for the money it is made of plastic what isn't ? The camera has a fixed mount that requires it to be mounted under a surface in order to get the correct positioning on the monitor again what I expected. the bad point I have to make is that the camera and the monitor require a power cord and the &#34;kit&#34; came with one power cord. Needing to get it installed for a trip I went to radio shack and got a charger cord that had the same plug and it all went together and worked well. so fare..,3,1
"I like the size of this camera and the mounting attachment. The playback video quality is good, even with night recording. I do not like the instructions that came with the camera, the functions on the camera are not user friendly or intuitive at all. Also the video driver causes my PC to crash on playback. All in all, I knew what I was purchasing and for the price is acceptable. I will probably upgrade to a higher quality and easier to use camera in the future.",3,1
"Overall, I am happy to have this Walkman, but the control buttons are difficult to differentiate between.  Additionally, the unit blows through batteries.",3,1
I gave it only three stars because it was mislabeled.  I ordered it for my Kindle Fire and it is a lot larger that my fire.  It slides around in the case but I still use it because it is cheaper to keep it than to send it back.  I would have given it five stars if it was the right size.,3,1
I put it away for emergency use.  It is nearly impossible to program without going to a dealer.,3,2
Good price but a little too weak to stand out among all the bluetooth speakers available.  FM is a joke but the inclusion of a micro-SD card reader is a nice touch.  Might be good for audiobooks.  Just load some on the SD card and take the speaker with you.,3,1
"This is a fun idea, but he only worked for about 10 minutes and then wouldn't move anymore.  It was not a battery issue, it was a joint issue.

"These protective products for i-pod are (in my opinion) very over priced. That said, there's another problem. When you put them on the i-pod you can't put the i-pod into a docking station. I bought extension cords which solve the problem. I will say that it protects the i-pod very well. I carry mine around for public performances and it takes a beating but so far has stayed protected.",3,1
"Jensen built yet another great unit. Like many of the reviews, I agree, the interface is easy to learn, but takes getting used to. My major concern for not giving this unit 5 stars is the delay between switching modes and reading time to play a standard CD. Switching modes causes the screen to shut off and come back on, almost like it is rebooting into a different mode every time. The down time from inserting a CD to actually listening to it is about 20-30 seconds, but seems like minutes compared 99% of units that are generally instantaneous. All in all, I bought this unit for the HD Radio part anyway and it is good. It picks up but it must have good strength signal to pick up. There is a slight delay in HD stations versus analog and does get annoying if it is cutting in between the two signals. All things considered, it is a good unit, but i would suggest looking at something else.",3,1
Overall this is good for the money. The only problem I had was the velcro was stronger than the glue holding it to the band. Took out some needle and thread and it works great now.,3,1
it does not connect complete snug.  and the phone is too heavy to stand up right to secure the connection.<br /><br />oh well.<br /><br />thank you anyway!!!!!!<br /><br />don't believe it is the product problem.  more the phone is the issure.,3,1
Works great but broke on me one day. The connector piece fell off.,3,1

"Overall the case is ok the only thing that is bad about it, which i hated was that the sides didn't grip the iPod they were just there and i found myself pushing them back onto the iPod which was quite annoying, but this may have only happend with my product, I ordered two different ones for this exact reason this http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041EWYSM/ref=oh_o00_s00_i00_details fit very well and i would recomend",3,2
My first ram mount purchase and I'm pleased how it came on time and it's quality workmanship. Looks very good on my kayak!,3,1
"The Bad: The unit has a poor display you can only see in the dark, or holding your hand over to block the light. Comes with a cheap plastic clip, which is not intended for rugged use (running or working out). No holders that I could find, had to rig up my own. Poor software is only provided by sony, which means if you lose it, Sony charges to down load new drivers. Good luck installing or recovering music from the unit.     The Good: Battery life, can last just about a full week on 1 charge. Easy to charge and set up, as the plug is the same as all my other sony products. Also has 3 differnt bass modes, shuffle and repeat.     All in all it's not a \\""bad\\"" unit. I would recommend the newer version and not this one.",3,2

"I purchased these phones based on positive reviews from Amazon.<br /><br />The reviews are a bit overstated.<br /><br />While there is nothing inherently wrong with these phones... they are just not that great.<br /><br />The bases are very light and cheesy.<br /><br />The phones themselves are adequate in style, feel, and perceived quality, but I was looking for something beyond Panasonic quality - and I didn't find it.<br /><br />The sound is also of adequate quality.<br /><br />Overall, these phones are just OK.<br /><br />**********<br /><br />Update 15 July 2012:  Some of the LEDs on one of the phones already burned out.<br /><br />Additionally, the phones don't have as many features as my 8 year old Siemens phones.<br /><br />I'm just not digging them.<br /><br />If I could go back in time, I think I'd spend more and take my chances with the Gigaset phones.",3,2
I paid about $13 for it delivered. It was worn the whole time. I think things should last longer than they do in general and that applies here so it is 3 stars to me. For about 2.5 times the cost of the band I could have a new watch. But I like the one I have the AQ150. I have not decided if I will order another from this supplier.,3,1

"when i received this cover case, the color was not as described in the pictures. It says it is a dark pink but instead, I received a very pale one, like the color of the cotton candy. so, this is good for a child, but for me is very bright. not something I will use on my nook color.",3,2
"This case is ok , not the best. When I was putting my case on it chipped at the corner. I was cooking and dropped my ipod and it broke in half it is not the best case",3,2
"Mixed review. On the one hand, a folio case with belt clip like this seems to be the best type to get. It provides the most security (full wraparound, well padded), you can open it to select a song while it's still fastened to your belt without danger of the iPod slipping out, and -- unlike folios that clip to your belt but open vertically -- this particular shape fits more comfortably on the belt (particularly if you've got a bit too much paunch, like the present writer). I've used different iPod cases, and I think this one's the most convenient.  HOWEVER, the thing is very poorly constructed; shame on InCase.  As other consumers have pointed out, the clear plastic (?) covering for the click wheel is so formidably thick that it interferes with control of the wheel, and I, like others, found myself taking a strong pair of scissors and simply snipping it out, leaving an unsightly ring of sheared plastic around the edge of the hole.  (The wheel is still covered most of the time by the folded-up folio itself, so it's not going to get damaged or dirty.)  The clear plastic that covers the screen is -- as has been pointed out -- VERY easily scratched.  No big deal, it still protects the actual iPod screen, but it's annoying.  The Velcro fastenings... well, I haven't yet discovered how long they'll last; surely they're not as strong and durable as the snap fastening that adorned a different inCase folio (leather, vertical, better made but less convenient).  MOST important and most unforgivable, each of the damned holes -- for the click wheel, the headphone plug, the recharging cable, and the on-off toggle -- is out of alignment with the thing it's supposed to grant access to (at least on my 30-gig video iPod).  I had to take a scissors and essentially rip the holes larger to accommodate the plug and the recharging cable, and the clickwheel hole is still misaligned, though one doesn't need access to the entire surface of the wheel to use it successfully.  So now the case works reasonably well, and, considering the alternatives, it's still the handiest way for me to carry around my iPod day to day. But it already looks rather worn and bedraggled because of the crude hole-enlargment I've performed.",3,1
I bought it for my Kobo ereader. I´t is made in good quality. Protects my ereader well from hits.  But it is unfortunately to big. You can just lay the ereader inside. But the holder and straps at the corners keep the ereader holding inside.,3,1
"everything is working fine, miss only fader and balance funktion and the screen is not readable during strong sunshine, but summary a good deal for that price",3,1
"I would just rate this product as ok - not great or bad.  I bought this cable because my iPod headphone jack now only plays sound in one ear and the repair shop couldn't fix it.  First of all, the cable itself seems to be of high quality.  This is the second iPod dock-connection-to-3.5mm cable I purchased (I'm able to actually disconnect the jack from the headphones itself) and this one seemed to be of higher quality.  The problem with the first cable I bought was that after a couple of months the cable wire bent then broke at the base of the iPod connector.  This one definitely seems sturdier.  Unfortunately, the iPod connection doesn't stay firmly in the dock when I'm moving around.  Obviously, it probably wasn't designed for that - they probably didn't envision someone would be using the cable as a replacment headphone cable.  But still...that's why I say this cable is only ok.  If your plan is to use it with a car or home stereo, however, I would definitely recommend.",3,2
"Just recently I had purchased a new car ipod adapter. I've had over 5 ipod adapters over the past couple of years and they never seem to last me very long. I have found that ipod players that plug straight into the aux plug work a lot better than those where you have to search for radio stations. Although some people don't have just an aux plug in there car, which is my case. Either way, having an ipod player for your car comes in handy and can be very useful, especially when you are in an area driving with no reception. It is also very useful for long road trips.   This product is so convenient not only because you can play all of your own music while you are driving, but also because you can charge your phone at the same time. I have an iphone, and on my car adapter there is a usb plug in, so that way I don't have to worry about my battery running out while I play my music because I can just charge it at the same time. This product always works very vell, but only for a certain amount of time.   My last purchase of a car ipod adapter was just about 5 months ago and it already stopped working. No I didn't get it wet, or blow out the plug, it just randomly stopped working. Before it stopped working, the radio stations on it would change on its own, where I would then have to mess with it until I got the right radio station again. This can be very inconvenient because the last thing you want to do while driving is try to fix an electronic device.  My next goal is to purchase an adapter that's actually worth my money and that will last me longer.",3,1
"Even in a lowered, noisy car people can hear me fine.  That aspect is great, but I'm finding that it's just about impossible to use voice dialing over Bluetooth on quite a few phones.  It's not really a limitation of the S4, but from what I can gather talking to people in the forums, it's Google and their stupid voice search app that comes on some phones.  The voice dialing needs to go through the phones hardware rather than Google, and I can't get that to work on several manufacturer/models of phone so far.<br /><br />It does work great for calls, it does announce the name/number, and if you add the app to your phone it will read text messages, although it announces the phone number as a number read in longform.  (e.g. 8173454884 becomes &#34;eight billion one million three hundred forty five thousand....&#34;)  For some reason it doesn't pull the name from the phone book when reading texts.",3,1
does not fit the regular nook. the 2 top straps dont even touch it the top of the nook. the bottom holds the nook in good enough for me so i will just keep it.,3,2
"the color from the case stained my fingers, but it protected the ipod well and isn't a problem with anything else",3,1
"Battery worked ok I guess. Sony said I needed a new battery and wanted to charged $110 including \\""labor\\"". I installed this one for much cheaper but it did not restore my mp3 player.  The battery did not require any soldering or special installation skill, but my mp3 player still doesn't work. Bad battery? Incorrect diagnosis from Sony? Can't say either way so... 3 stars.",3,2
IT DIDN'T WORK WITH THE INTERNET.,3,2
"We almost returned these after the hooks that secure to the headrest posts snapped.  We bought two mounts and 3 out of the 4 hooks snapped.  The instructions are 4 basic pictures on the back of the box, but the installation felt intuitive.  Unfortunately, the instructions do not share that there's a removable piece in the the hooks to fit a larger diameter headrest post.  But I didn't figure it out until both mounts were broken.  The tablet holder portion is easy to adjust and is able to fit our kids' 7\\"" Navi tablets.  My 2-year-old's posture was much better as she watched a movie (for the 5 minutes before it broke).  We'll be keeping them so we don't have to mess with paying for the exchange and will just zip-tie them to our headrests instead.",3,2
Pros:<br />-Functional<br />-The cord length is great (it fit into the jack in my center counsel under the arm rest)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-the coil cord part of it can sometimes be a pain (can keep the center counsel from closing)<br />-not the most aesthetically pleasing<br />-Bulky,3,1
"Its a nice case, beatiful colors,but it is not hard enough to protect the iPod. It is made of Two plastic pieces.",3,2
I like the product.  Not as loud as i would have hoped.  Super Bass not that impressive.  OK for the purchase price.,3,1
"I appreciate receiving so much of the accessories and gadgets at one reasonable price.  All very useful.  However, there are about 3-4 items that I have no use for and if purchased separately, each one would cost the same or more than this one purchase which gives you an idea of the quality.  Not that the stuff is bad, each works as expected, but each one could be purchased separately at the Dollar Store.",3,1
"I would give this 5 stars IF the most important [to me] features worked. The single biggest reason I went with this model is the Mirrorlink function for android phones - effectively adding the best navigation because you can supposedly mirror most apps including Google maps from your phone, and control them from the touchscreen. However after installing Mirrorlink does not work with my Galaxy S6. Research revealed incompatibility with the Samsung Galaxy S5 and S6. HOWEVER they are NOW listed as certified compatible on mirrorlink site as of 3 months ago. I thought I may need to upgrade firmware on the stereo, but it was shipped with the newest 8.31 version from 2 months ago. So I do not know why it does not work. I will be contacting pioneer and will update this review if they can make it work as advertised.  UPDATE: This is due to misleading advertising, although not technically incorrect. Here goes. I did get the mirrorlink to work, but it is only the base mirrorlink. In other words the &#34;your favorite apps&#34; is BS. It only supports the 5 proprietary apps listed on mirrorlink.com (NOT your apps). Only one of them can be considered even slightly useful, Sygic navigation, and only because it has downloaded offline maps in case you have zero service on your phone. This could come in handy in that rare occasion but I've used it and it is inferior in every other aspect. I will definitely keep using Google maps on my phone instead. Now for the final explanation. Some radios with Mirrorlink can mirror all of the Google apps like Google maps. That is by using Android Auto. It is a new, seprate app. I found that the EU version of this (8800bt) lists Android Auto compatibility as a feature. THIS 7700bt will not recognize Android Auto and it is not listed as an additional feature. Probably partially the reason it is so cheap.  I thought about returning it, but there is not a comparable deck that is available in US yet that supports Android Auto, AND is a fold out screen. Fold out screens are rare nowadays. In fact I bought the full double din version but returned it for this because of the modifications I would have had to make on my vehicle.",3,2
"The quality of the product is not up to Apple standards, but neither is the price. 8-) These are basic, no-frills accessories.    PRO: Cheap, cheap, cheap. Works well with my 2nd-gen iPod touch.    CON: The dock connector on the data cable and the car charger is larger than that on Apple's cable. If you have a case with a particularly small opening (such as the fantastic SwitchEasy Neo Crystal), it may not fit without some modification. (No modification necessary for the wall charger's smaller plug.)    NOTE: The products I received WERE NOT the products pictured. I received a wall charger with a much smaller, sideways-oriented transformer. The data cable I received was a sturdy cable rather than the rather flimsy retractable one in the picture. These differences may be why my assessment differs from the earlier reviews of this product.",3,2
"Original item has &#34;HD&#34; in the title, kinda misleading. At least it has changed now.<br />So, it's not HD, sensor data can't be exported, proprietary video player required to access data on micro SD card. Battery is probably below average. Y-axis sensor reading seems to be incorrect, possibly software bug.<br />Will most likely upgrade to something else soon.",3,2
"This was a cute case, but too big for an I-pod.  It fit on the I- pod, but it wasn't a tight fit so the I-pod would slip out.",3,2
"Althought the construction of this armband is strong there are some issues with it. First the plastic o-ring used to secure the band tend to twist on its own if the armband is tighten too much, You would need a second person to help you or press your arm against a wall to keep it from twisting. Secondly; This armband, even if it says is for the droid x, doesnt work with it, the windows doesnt allow for the whole screen to be accessible and the buttons on the phone get covered by the windows rubber trim and if you want to access the button you have to raise the phone up making the section of the phone with the camera lense to be exposed, this will cause the phone to slide out of the armban.",3,2
I got what I paid for.  Enough said.,3,1
"At first I was very intrigued with the item. it was working fine for awhile,till a couple of weeks later. Everything kinda started falling apart on it. It wouldn't stay still, it would receive other signal at times. I should of just gone with an Aux. plug. Other than that,it got here pretty fast, good shipment, and great packaging.",3,2
"It was not what I was expecting, to difficult to put it in your wrist and it is too big for mine",3,2
The cost was right on. I just hope it lasts. But I've always liked Sony products! far it should work out,3,1
"I purchased this item as a gift for a family member and assisted them with installing it on an iPod Touch.  The fitment was not perfect as the case followed the general shape of the iPod but the gaps were inconsistent.  For instance, the top left corner was nice and tight but the top right had a slight gap.  Also the top of the case is even with the front glass but the bottom is just a hair off and doesn't project all the way to the glass.  The coloring of the case is nice but note that it is a shade darker than shown in the photo.  I am worried that the coloring will begin to fade/wear with lots of handling.  Overall, the case will protect the back of the iPod, looks nice for now, and I'm not worried about the case popping off, so I would purchase it again.",3,1
Pretty much as expected. Works. Use it daily. Have no real use for the games or video player. Plays music as expected. Fidelity of the FM radio is poor. Buttons aren't intuitive but easily learned.,3,1
"I would consider the rock-it 3.0 more of a novelty item to use for fun. One thing I do not like is how the wire for the surface contact is wound into the device itself. This can cause for the wire to become kinked or the pressure needed to unwind or wind the wire can cause it to break.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend it's usage over actual speakers.<br /><br />The concept is actually brilliant - to use vibrations on surfaces to amplify sound.<br />Imagine the rock-it on a bigger scale with a larger surface contact and more wattage being used, it is possible to turn a sturdy surface into a speaker as long as the surface can be vibrated.",3,2
"this is a good product, and for the price it is amazing. however, the screen protectors are slightly off center so it doesn't cover the entire black part of the front of my ipod touch. still does what it needs to do, and no complaints otherwise. i would buy again if i run out of screen protectors. the price is fantastic",3,1
This screen protector is very tricky to apply.  Had trouble separating the layers.  Once applied it is very nice and cuts down on screen glare.,3,2
"The item was just as described and appeared to be the same as the old battery.  However, my iPod is not taking a charge and will not connect to the computer.  This could have been due to me installing the battery wrong but I don't think so.  With my old battery it wouldn't hold a charge but I could at least add or remove songs from the computer but not with this battery.",3,2
"kinda cheap and i think its what they call copper clad, its carodes after a while but its good for the price, better off buying some 4awg O2 free copper wire then this if u can afford it",3,1
Fits perfect. Works out nice,3,1
"I was a little concerned with the plastic casing that came in the bundle.  And it's very hard to pry off once you get it on.  But it's snug. You can't update your ipod when the case is on it.  There isn't a good slot for the cable to run comfortably, so you end up having to take the case off EVERY time you charge, or plug in your ipod.  I ended up cracking the case, so there goes that one.  The clear screen protecter saved my device from scratches and has stayed in place.  And the chargers work great.",3,1
The charger is ok at what it does it charges the phone a bit slower than the original charger but it gets the job done.the connector does not fit as snug in the iPhone charge port as the original but will suffice. It does an ok job for the price I paid for it not a bad buy.,3,1
This clip worked well but it is very bulky.,3,1
I brought as a gift. I'm upset I brought as a gift and the person is not using it. Nice Case though!,3,1
This product is okay...thou I had only had it for about a month and the screen broke randomly. So the touch screen doesnt work no more :(. But I guess that is what I get for buying a cheap wannbe ipod touch. Thou if you do want a mp3 player just not as much of the ipod I suggest this. But I'm just going to go ahead and buy me a ipod touch..its a much better product. :),3,2
"I purchased this item from OnFair (in black color).  The video monitor themselves seem to work well, the quality of the video screens is great for the price.  However, I received an incomplete package, I did not receive all the adaptor sleeves for the headrest posts.  Brandon, the owner of OnFair (I think it is a 1-man company, as he outsources his shipping) responded to my initial emails quickly, but then he stopped responding completely to my followup emails and I never received the posts.  Two and half weeks after receiving the package and with no further contact from OnFair after day 2, I was forced to install the headrests with the incorrect smaller size sleeve, and thus the headrest rattles.  I will have to MacGyver a solution to stop the rattle (i.e. several layers of electrical tape), but buyers beware that if you have anything wrong with your OnFair purchase, you probably won't get any kind of resolution from them.  Hopefully you will get lucky and get a complete package with all the parts and fully functional monitors.",3,2
"not worth the money the adhesive need some help, but overall a good looking emblem, I would not recogmend this item for long term use, kinda cheesey.",3,1
"I couldn't believe my eyes when I opened the package!  Made by Apple of California  The USB wall charger is identical, the adapter cable looks identical, but does not have the same dimensions. The metal part that attaches to the ipod is correct, but the spacing of the plastic holder is wider. If you have an otterbox case that has a plug to fit the sync cable, this cable will not mate with your ipod while it is in the otterbox case. The sync cable plastic plug holder is also cheap--unless you are careful in holding the plastic connector to remove it from the ipod, the connector will fall apart. If you pull the sync cable to detach it from the ipod, the metal connector may stay plugged into the ipod while the plastic connector will fall apart.  Definately a good deal for the wall charger, which costs $29 from apple. So-so on the sync cable.",3,2
"This case looks and feels great, but the texture is so soft that I feel even more like I'm going to drop the iPod when I use the case. It was bad enough before I put it on, but this is worse. Also I can already tell that the bit between the screen and the volume buttons is going to break off, so I'm trying to go very easy on it. Overall I'm happy with the look & feel but it's not my favorite case by a long shot.",3,1
It is very muffled since the case completely covers the speaker.  The case slides down out of the top bands which then causes the nook to fall out.,3,2
"NOT FOR STANDARD SUBWOOFERS.  That could have put that in the description and I wouldn't be here now.<br /><br />I bought this for a standard 18\\"" subwoofer, believing the description was simply for the brand Atrend, not Atrend's customized box for only RE subwoofers of a certain series that this vendor sells.  I don't feel it really says this in the description, especially since the brand RE looks like \\""Re:\\"" in the description: \\""Brand New Atrend 18xxxsq Re Audio Xxx18d2 18\\"" Sealed Subwoofer Enclosure Box\\""  without further explanation, I feel it reads like a hastily put together heading, and what was being sold was an 18\\"" subwoofer box.<br /><br />So, I'll need to make a new front panel to correctly fit my standard size subwoofer (the RE Audio one is around [...] and its a dual voice coil power monster, not what I need for my home theater application.)I was able to build up the sides just enough to let the sub's own weight hold it in place...its not permanent, but I was anxious to test.<br /><br />The good news is that the box is built well, had very little corner damage in shipping, and with the addition of 2.5 lbs of poly stuffing (also bought on Amazon, but I used the craft grade stuff in lieu of paying 4 times more for the audio grade stuff) this box goes very low and loud.  Bass below 32hz was non existant before I added this box.  I can now hear down to about 22 hz (using my Audio Control Earthquake to boost the lower octave).  Before, even with max boost, my 12\\"" sub could barely go below 40.  I now have usable bass well below that.<br /><br />All this with a [...] 18\\"" car subwoofer and a [...] sub box.  For comparison, an 18\\"" self-powered home audio grade subwoofer starts at $1000 and there are several models that are [...].  Giant pro-audio grade cabinets can be had for [...], but they go LOUD and not low, and they are usually giant and ruggedized.  This gets the job done for home theater for under [...].",3,2
"I bought this case because it was inexpensive and I wanted to protect my new Nook Tablet at the beach.  I am giving it 3 stars because for the money it is fine.  It holds the nook well.  I like the pockets inside to hold hotel keys, credit card, etc.  The leather is very hard, and I will eventually purchase a nicer, softer leather, but for the price, this is fine for now.  It was shipped right away and I had it within a week.",3,1
"After receiving the item in the mail, I tried connecting it to my device and it did not fit. However, being that I paid so little for it I figure I could keep it and sell it to someone I know whose device it would fit. So all in all no love lost or gained!",3,2
"Bought this for my mother and she likes it...except it switches to the USB mode in the middle of a CD. She got it to play the CD again, but it switched back to the USB mode 3 more times so she gave up. I unplugged the cord for 15 minutes, then tried again and it played the entire CD this time. I don't know if this is a  bad boombox, or what...anyone else have this problem? When it's working, she likes the sound and the remote.",3,1
"works, but very limited batter life. roughly 2hours. also not extremely user friendly. once you figure out bugs, it's ok.",3,2
"Not a bad product. The cord situation is a little irritating, but the sound quality is nice overall.<br />I cant really tell much of a difference with the bass boost, it really just seems louder.",3,1
"works fine in small showers, sound is lacking in my opinion...",3,1
"Really liked the player, unfortunately the screen went dead after about a month.I have owned a number of sansa's and like their players. Too bad the last few I got have not lasted very long....",3,2
"I got this for my teenage daughter and it was not very user friendly.  The unit looked good and had nice sound, but it did have a little crackle if you turned down the volume knob. Setting the time, date and alarm was quite hard to do.  Although if you are a hard sleeper, when the chirping alarm did go off it would wake up the whole house.  I nearly jumped out of bed and thought the roosters were invading the house.  I did end up sending it back and the company did refund me quickly and it was a easy transaction.",3,1
"I purchased two radio adapters. Mine workes great, my brother claims the chrager portion of the adapter \\""blew up\\"" in his car. At least the trasmitter still works :)",3,1
"Does not auto shut off, loud but distorts at high volume, will be replacing with another speaker.",3,2
This item works as expected. Would have liked for it to not have been such a super tight fit. Almost thought at first it was the wrong item.,3,1
"If you want a light, compact stand that is easy to travel with and adequate to hold a Kindle (no problem) or iPad (some concerns about tipping), then this is a fine choice. But I do worry a bit about a neighbor jostling my tray on a plane and my device crashing off as a result. Devices don't clip into this stand, they rest on it, and so jostling and mishaps are a risk. But I still like and use it because it's portable and works just fine. I just keep an eye out for incoming accidents!",3,1
"Screen Protector seems OK, a little ragged but does an acceptable job, The screen protective film did not last very long before it showed signs of curling. Lots of bubbles. But technically - it works.",3,1
"The pictures show 3 small pockets where you can store your microSD cards. The actual product does NOT have these little pockets. As these pockets were the main reason I selected this cover over all the others on the market, I was VERY displeased.<br /><br />Other than the lack of covers, this is a nice case for the Nook. When you open the case, the holder for the nook is on the wrong side (the left, where most cases open and the nook is tucked away on the right), but it's not a huge deal.",3,1
You pay for what you get.  The price is fair but it doesn't charge as well and rips easily.  But if you are looking for just something to carry around and use as a back up than it isn't too bad.,3,2
"I ordered a 3 pack. First one I put on, I realized my screen wasnt PERFECTLY clean; my mistake. Second one in the package had scuffs and scratches on it already, (bummer)! Ok; that is why they pack 3!! Andddd....the third one had little specs of dust or something on it between the removable layer and the actual screen protector....hmmmm.... I wish I did it right the first time. I could see this being an excellent screen protector! If only we could meet in the middle.",3,1
"Purchased for a gift. Would be excellent for a hiker or travelor, but too high tech for recipient.  Well made and arrived quickly.",3,1
Very nice selection of covers..given to my daughter with her ipod for christmas.  They all fit perfectly and she was very pleased with them.,3,1
This is not an apple quality but if you can get 2 for under 10$ its totally worth it.  I lose these things before they break down most of the time anyway.,3,1
For short usage,3,1
The case works for the purpose but not without some redesign on my part.  There is no slot for access to the on/off and volume controls on the underside of the case.  Had to do some careful cutting of the case to make it work to my satisfaction.,3,2
"Sometimes it sync and sometimes it won't.  Couldn't sync with iPhone 5c tried on numerous occasions.  Sometimes Bluetooth signal is lost, you have to shut down and start over.",3,2
"I love the color and look of this case. But it is sorta uncomfortable, its hard to hold but very cute.",3,1
Works fine and screen is right size for easy viewing. Didn't score higher because it interferes with Sirius radio transmission. Otherwise a good product.,3,1
"This speaker is fashionable, but it falls short on quality!  They are really distorted.  I like that it has an on/off switch but they block the audio plug on the iTouch 2 so I can not add a microphone thus making the iPod touch 2 have sound without earphones and be able to record a note or something. In fact, the iTouch 2 will not work with one of those little thumbtack looking microphones, they are not compabile.  The Lego speaker would not be bad for 5 bucks or so, but for $20 they fall way short on quality of sound.",3,2
Its works well but I didn't receive an adapter usb drive to keep it juiced up. (Good thing I had one form the old one),3,1
Not very sturdy.  Plastic is already falling apart after a few weeks of use.  Ears are &#34;cute&#34; but not attached well.,3,2
"I was hopeing this would sound a little better, I quess I should have known it would sound weak for the price.",3,2
Links up quickly but can drop connection at times.  must be turned off when leaving my car at home or it will stay connected when I am in the house.  Great  range  so i have no idea why it disconnects when i am driving.  good for hands free and worth the price if you dont like using the little earbud sets.,3,1
"Comes with a tool and screws to install a 2.5\\"" Hard Drive.   Allows you to connect to the TV using HDMI and Composite (RCA) connections.  Additionally you can connect up USB devices which contain media to play or the uSB can be connected to transfer media to the device.   It comes with a remote that is used to control the Device like a DVD player. THough you need to get used to the available selections.

It worked for about a week or so and stopped connecting to any radio station. A little disappointed in it,3,2
"As a buyer of well-over 300 Baofeng radios (and counting) for the group I belong to (not all of which were purchased through Amazon but many were), I'm always amazed at the lengths some sellers go to to hype their products as being \\""newer\\"" or \\""better\\"" than other models, or perhaps (to give them the benefit of the doubt) they just don't know any better.<br /><br />First, the Baofeng UV-5R series (including the original and still extremely popular UV-5R, I'll explain why in a minute) is what is normally referred to by many as a SDR radio (or software defined radio).  While not a true SDR product (you can't use it with your computer to control the radio's functions or scan a wide amount of VHF/UHF frequencies with it), none the less a large chip is programmed on the circuit board built inside each radio.  That chip determines what capability the radio itself can perform.<br /><br />Every UV-5R series radio has the ability to transmit from 136-174 MHz on VHF and from 400-520 MHz on UHF in both narrow-band and wide-band modes (very useful for the occasional FRS or MURS use, which requires narrow-band mode to work correctly).<br /><br />Every model does \\""at least\\"" 4W on VHF/UHF from the factory, but occasionally you'll get a batch that does 4.5W or even 5W out, but the difference between 4W and 5W is minimal at best.  A 4W radio with a better antenna will easily outperform a 5W radio with the standard crappy antenna that Baofeng ships on ALL (including the UV-5RA, -5RAX, and -5RAX+) models.<br /><br />Baofeng DOES NOT program those chips any differently for the UV-5R vs. any other UV-5R series (including the UV-5RA).  Version 307 of the firmware (which is the most current release I have in any of my radios) works EXACTLY the same way as previous older releases of firmware at least back to the 295 release (over a year ago), so any claim from a seller that this release provides additional features (at least from a user's perspective) is simply BOGUS, since the firmware inside both radios have the same features.  In fact, my UV-5R radios with the 307 firmware release is EXACTLY the same radio (inside and within the firmware) as my UV-5RA radios with the 307 firmware release.<br /><br />Second, you CANNOT in any way upgrade the firmware (unless you count buying a different radio and it comes with a different firmware release), so again the claim in the listing from some sellers that you can is simply BOGUS.<br /><br />Third, you can believe that two thinner pieces (glued or screwed together on the faceplate of the UV-5RA) is somehow stronger than one thicker piece of plastic (on the original UV-5R series) if you like (and maybe it is), but I haven't seen that in real-world use from my own UV-5RA units.  The standard UV-5R units that we use seem to hold up just as well (when dropped in the desert dirt or rolling down a hill) as any other Baofeng radio we own and use.<br /><br />Fourth, and my biggest issue with all of the non-standard UV-5RA, UV-5RAX and UV-5RAX+ units, is that NONE of the Baofeng battery accessories (except the little 1800 mAh standard battery) work WITHOUT modification (unless you use a Dremel tool to grind or cut off part of your extended battery that works on the standard UV-5R - but won't work on your UV-5RA, UV-5RAX or UV-5RAX+).<br /><br />Getting new UV-5RA units that don't work with Extended 3800 mAh batteries (without modification) doesn't make my group happy.  That may not bother you, but NONE of the sellers of the non-standard UV-5RA, UV-5RAX, and UV-5RAX+ units ever seem to mention that lack of hardware compatibility in their listings, so buyer beware!<br /><br />BTW, NONE of the \\""AA\\"" or \\""AAA\\"" battery shell packs work on the UV-5RA, UV-5RAX, or UV-5RAX+ units either, so that's 3 different battery accessories (including the 3800 mAh extended battery) that you can't use on these radios without hacking them with a Dremel tool (but they all work without modification on the original UV-5R units).<br /><br />So \\""if\\"" you want a \\""pretty\\"" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (or -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.  Oh, you should see how well that shiny faceplate lights up when a flashlight hits it in the dark, just the thing you don't want for night use.<br /><br />Virtually every guy in our group ends up carrying a standard UV-5R and giving the UV-5RA, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ to the wife or kids, since the wife and/or kids rarely care about the other accessories working and they (the wife and kids) tend to like the \\""pretty\\"" radios, but again there is NO INTERNAL difference and NO EXTRA FEATURES in the UV-5RA, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ units (other than a different looking shiny faceplate) vs. the original and still wildly popular UV-5R (which I refer to as the M16 of radios, as all the accessories you match it up with just plain work).<br /><br />Now you know the real background on these radios.f\\"" you want a \\""pretty\\"" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (or -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.

My opinion -- I put both lens recording forward to check the differences in the two lens. Neither recording gave me true sharp color. I tried it early morning and mid day, not sharp color. One lens starts the view too far out from my hood and one lens shows the hood but makes everything too small. The motion is smooth and it is an average product. If you want clear and sharp color this is not the product you want.",3,2
"I had liked my case right when I got it, yeah it's cute, but little did I know that it was crappy, and to be able to charge it, I have to take the case off. The case cracked and chipped a lot.",3,1
Cheapo case. The zipper came appart first use. Got the zipper to mesh again otherwise its an ok case but is cheap.,3,2
"I didn't have high expectations and these weren't really expensive so I'm not terribly disappointed, but I guess I was hoping they'd be a little brighter.  These seem well made and work as intended, but I'm really not sure what application they'd be good for - they really are not bright enough for an effective fog light.",3,2
"I just receive it today.<br />The international shipping is fine, and there is no delay.<br />However, there are some problems with the product that I will list below.<br />1) The remote control has a crack on it and does not work.<br />2) The charger is not working.<br />3) Once turned off, the player will play from the beginning of list with the MINIMUM volume next time.<br />4) The main reason for me to buy the product is to have a playable &#34;cassette&#34; to carry all my mp3 songs to be played in my car. The player itself needs to be turned ON to play and to allow the car system to output the sound. It is capable of running on battery, but it will defeat the purpose of continuous play of music. So, naturally, plug in the power via Mini-USB. However, this is where the MAJOR PROBLEM comes in. Once the power is plugged in via Mini-USB, it becomes impossible to insert the cassette into the car system, because the plug is too big to fit. As a result, the cassette is not fully inserted into the system, and of course, there will be NO MUSIC.<br />Bottom line is that an user must unplug the power and insert the cassette by itself (while it is turned on) to run on its own battery to have the music output through the car sound system.",3,2
"I bought this item not that long ago, and is not working anymore.",3,2
"My husband ordered these for me and I didn't really like them.  I feel the sound quality is poor and there is a lot of feed back with them.  He had  another set of Lifetron Speakers which are far superior to these so if you want a good set look for model number<br />FG-8010, I took his and made him take the ones he ordered for me.  The Lifetron Speakers Model # FG-8010 are fantastic ......they are made by the same company so just get the right speakers is all I am telling you.",3,1
"The case was a little small for a 3g. It still fits fine, but I have to take the bottom off if I want to hook it up to my ipod thing in my car. It's a snug fit, but you'll like it, it's really nice.",3,1
"I bought this on impulse because it was a good deal. I should have researched it better. Unit doesn't work with 4g iphone, even with high speed Alpine cable.  I am able to listen to songs through aux input only. I bought a cde-122bt for my boat and it works great.  This is not a slam at the vendor. I will end up buying the cde-136bt as I already have the wiring harness for Alpine installed.",3,1
"works in my chevrolet but not in my subaru.<br />does not work on bumpy road, falls out of vent<br />works great on smooth roads, like interstate",3,1
overall okay- you can tell it is an aftermarket product. the plug into my tom-tom is tight and extermly hard to fit into. overall it does what it is suposed to do and thats charge my unit.,3,1

"This is my first screen protector so I can't compare it to anything.  However, I will note that bubbles have begun to form on both mine and my wife's phones a few months after what seemed to be a good clean application.  The bubbles are around the edge of the phone so it's possible that this is where the edge of our phone cases are rubbing the screen protector. While disappointed with what they look like now, the price really was a steal.",3,1
I bought this for my daughters 11th birthday.  She used it one day and the gems are peeling off. Quite disappointed!!,3,2
"If you have an iPhone, you NEED a portable charger.  There's no way to really get through a day of heavy use without one.  This charger does the trick, and the flashlight functionality is good.<br /><br />The worst part about it is that it looks like a pocket vibrator.  I'm embarrassed every time I take it out or someone spots it in my purse.  This is probably not so much an issue for men, but women, if you are modest you may want to think twice.",3,2
"Where is the antenna in your car? Because if it is in the front, this product works well, but in a car where the antenna is in the back we've had nothing but issues. Purchased two as gifts, one was well received, the other I see tossed in the backseat in it's case. Good idea but not very happy that four feet of space disrupts signal so much. Wasn't worth the time to return. Bought an ac adapter for use in the house also and as long as its close to the radio works fine.",3,1
"When I first bought the Trakteq I was very impress not only is it a gps also is an e-reader,you can put pictures on it,music,and a bunch of other things.I didn't know that it had all these other functions,even my 10 year old plays with it alot.The only problem I had with it was the customeer service I had lost a piece of my Trakteq,getting through was the hard part.It was just a good thing I didn't lose my reciept so I was able to send it back with my RMA number which took forever to come.I had no real problem with this device would love to get another.",3,1
"Good protective case, love the feel, but the tabs need work, doesn't stay on very well, mostly referring to the bottom part of it.",3,1
"It transmits well. I have 2 problems. The arm is too short and won't stay in the position I want. The audio cable is too short, so I can't pick up the phone in my hand while connected.",3,2
This cable seems to have interference where I can hear some music from the radio? in the background when its quiet.  I don't remember having this problem with the cable I bought from the dealership.,3,1

"This works well if you're always indoors with your iPod, the sunlight had a really huge affect on being able to see the screen.",3,1
Manuel for the player looked like they were running out of ink when it was printed and was very limited on information. The player that is used in the how to videos is not the same one that I was sent. Tried loading a song on it and was not able to figure it out. I ended up returning the product for a refund.,3,2
Fit snugly and does what its meant to do but the fact it attracts dust like a hyperactive magnet prompted me to give a 3 stars rating.,3,2
"The case itself is nice. I wish I could keep it, but I plan to return it today. The supplied 3M tape used to secure the Nook Color into the case won't stay stuck to the Nook. I followed all the directions. Then, I went out and purchased more of the 3M tape, cleaned the Nook Color's back with isopropyl alcohol and tried to secure the 3M product to the nook. After waiting two days, it still won't hold onto the Nook.",3,2
The Otterbox is really great and very solid construction and at first the headphones were great. I swim 3x's a week for about an hour. After about 5 uses the headphones developed a short and now only play through the right channel. I have not been rough at all. I primarily swim freestyle and mix in some breaststroke.,3,1
"Item arrived in 4 days. No problem installing into NookColor. Screen to select either Nook or Android was a little odd to me and the print is small. Android booted fine and all seems to work good. I'm just behind the curve on apps (old guy) and am having some difficulty figuring out how the apps work.  I was glad to see Kindle app as I have several books on that and the sync worked good. I'll comment on other apps at a later date, but I was pleased to see that when the Netflix app appeared it worked just fine.  Picture is good but spoken words not synced very well. I've only watched a short time and can't tell if this is getting better?    All in all, the N2A makes the NookColor much more interesting to me and as I learn to use the apps I think it will continue to be a great little tablet for me for a long time.  BTW..I got the refurb NookColor, so that and the price of the N2A was very reasonable.",3,1
My daughter likes it,3,1
"The silicone casing is somewhat see through which, to me, takes away from the appearance of it.  The clip on the back tightens like a screw.  As you're running or even walking, it loosens and your player can actually just fall off.  I did not like the screen protector... I really liked the wrist band however, lol.  I would not purchase these items again or recommend them to others.",3,1
"I use these to update iPads through a MacBook using the Configurator program. The cables worked well updating about ten units each. After that, one of the cables, when connected to the iPad, showed as incompatible equipment and no longer allowed communication between the devices.",3,1

Would be greater if had option of different lengths.",3,2

kids found them very entertaining and did not seem to mind that sound only came from one speaker.  I was a bit disappointed.  they are also quite small.,3,1
My iPod was a little too thin to fit properly. I had to cut the foam piece in half to slide it down the back of my iPod. Fits like a glove now. Should be slightly thinner in my book.,3,1
"This is a great product for the 30 gb size Vision but is too small for the 60 gb size. I had to cut slits in the sides to allow enough room so that the buttons are not constantly pressed. Without the slits you couldn't even turn it on without taking it out of the skin. If the buttons are pressed when you are trying to turn it on, it won't turn on. The plastic screen cover is useless for the 60 gig since it won't stay on. I can't comment on that feature for a 30 gig model.",3,2
"As a buyer of well-over 300 Baofeng radios (and counting) for the group I belong to (not all of which were purchased through Amazon but many were), I'm always amazed at the lengths some sellers go to to hype their products as being \\""newer\\"" or \\""better\\"" than other models, or perhaps (to give them the benefit of the doubt) they just don't know any better.<br /><br />First, the Baofeng UV-5R series (including the original and still extremely popular UV-5R, I'll explain why in a minute) is what is normally referred to by many as a SDR radio (or software defined radio).  While not a true SDR product (you can't use it with your computer to control the radio's functions or scan a wide amount of VHF/UHF frequencies with it), none the less a large chip is programmed on the circuit board built inside each radio.  That chip determines what capability the radio itself can perform.<br /><br />Every UV-5R series radio has the ability to transmit from 136-174 MHz on VHF and from 400-520 MHz on UHF in both narrow-band and wide-band modes (very useful for the occasional FRS or MURS use, which requires narrow-band mode to work correctly).<br /><br />Every model does \\""at least\\"" 4W on VHF/UHF from the factory, but occasionally you'll get a batch that does 4.5W or even 5W out, but the difference between 4W and 5W is minimal at best.  A 4W radio with a better antenna will easily outperform a 5W radio with the standard crappy antenna that Baofeng ships on ALL (including the UV-5RA, -5RAX, and -5RAX+) models.<br /><br />Baofeng DOES NOT program those chips any differently for the UV-5R vs. any other UV-5R series (including the UV-5RA).  Version 307 of the firmware (which is the most current release I have in any of my radios) works EXACTLY the same way as previous older releases of firmware at least back to the 295 release (over a year ago), so any claim from a seller that this release provides additional features (at least from a user's perspective) is simply BOGUS, since the firmware inside both radios have the same features.  In fact, my UV-5R radios with the 307 firmware release is EXACTLY the same radio (inside and within the firmware) as my UV-5RA radios with the 307 firmware release.<br /><br />Second, you CANNOT in any way upgrade the firmware (unless you count buying a different radio and it comes with a different firmware release), so again the claim in the listing from some sellers that you can is simply BOGUS.<br /><br />Third, you can believe that two thinner pieces (glued or screwed together on the faceplate of the UV-5RA) is somehow stronger than one thicker piece of plastic (on the original UV-5R series) if you like (and maybe it is), but I haven't seen that in real-world use from my own UV-5RA units.  The standard UV-5R units that we use seem to hold up just as well (when dropped in the desert dirt or rolling down a hill) as any other Baofeng radio we own and use.<br /><br />Fourth, and my biggest issue with all of the non-standard UV-5RA, UV-5RAX and UV-5RAX+ units, is that NONE of the Baofeng battery accessories (except the little 1800 mAh standard battery) work WITHOUT modification (unless you use a Dremel tool to grind or cut off part of your extended battery that works on the standard UV-5R - but won't work on your UV-5RA, UV-5RAX or UV-5RAX+).<br /><br />Getting new UV-5RA units that don't work with Extended 3800 mAh batteries (without modification) doesn't make my group happy.  That may not bother you, but NONE of the sellers of the non-standard UV-5RA, UV-5RAX, and UV-5RAX+ units ever seem to mention that lack of hardware compatibility in their listings, so buyer beware!<br /><br />BTW, NONE of the \\""AA\\"" or \\""AAA\\"" battery shell packs work on the UV-5RA, UV-5RAX, or UV-5RAX+ units either, so that's 3 different battery accessories (including the 3800 mAh extended battery) that you can't use on these radios without hacking them with a Dremel tool (but they all work without modification on the original UV-5R units).<br /><br />So \\""if\\"" you want a \\""pretty\\"" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (or -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.  Oh, you should see how well that shiny faceplate lights up when a flashlight hits it in the dark, just the thing you don't want for night use.<br /><br />Virtually every guy in our group ends up carrying a standard UV-5R and giving the UV-5RA, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ to the wife or kids, since the wife and/or kids rarely care about the other accessories working and they (the wife and kids) tend to like the \\""pretty\\"" radios, but again there is NO INTERNAL difference and NO EXTRA FEATURES in the UV-5RA, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ units (other than a different looking shiny faceplate) vs. the original and still wildly popular UV-5R (which I refer to as the M16 of radios, as all the accessories you match it up with just plain work).<br /><br />Now you know the real background on these radios.f\\"" you want a \\""pretty\\"" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (or -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.

"I bought this amp because it, and its predecessor, had great reviews and didn't overheat. I paid to have my setup professionally installed and the tech said he can split my 4 speakers from 1 amp (4 channels from a 2 channel amp), I was a bit concerned since my backs had a higher RMS and peak than my fronts, nonetheless, the tech recommended it and they were the specialists. I was smelling something hot in my trunk for a few days but I paid no mind to that. Five days later and my amp overheated. Both myself and the tech that did the install think that the mids and highs \\""disappeared\\"" because the amp overheated. I suppose you get what you pay for and it really will deliver the amount of power per channel only, which is a good thing.  I forgot to mention, it comes back on after you let it cool down a bit, other thing is, after the first overheat, the sound quality decreases at times and gets back to its original level at times.  What happened that caused it to over heat:  - 4 speakers run off of 2 channels.  - Total RMS power requirement on speakers was 230 watts.  - Peak power requirement on speakers 460 watts.  - Possible poor placement of the amp.  After considering all that, how did it push 12\\"" subs in other reviews but overheat in my scenario? My 10\\"" sub has 200W RMS and 800W peak.",3,1

Development is lacking some. Interface is not up to par with today's touchscreen standards. I had the intention of plugging my phone in and forgetting it. The interface requires multiple interactions with your phone. Each feature is done differently and cumbersome. Still love having Pandora in my truck though.,3,1
Instructions are not detailed but was able to figure it out after some experimentation. Works OK now. Range is short...can't leave the room with out dropping the connection.,3,2

Not very loud.,3,2
"I just bought this product and it arrived literally three days after I ordered it. I've only used it once. For most of the ride, it had decent sound quality, but it picked up a LOT of static towards the end of the ride. But I'm assuming there's a way to manage that by altering the radio station choice, which is true for most of these gadgets. It's attractive and works fine with my sd card. I love that it lists the name of the song that's playing (my last car mp3 player did not).",3,1

Instead of returning the product, I got in touch with the company that makes powermonkey.  They were very resopnsive to my email complaint and are sending me a new solar panel.  I am leaving on a month long hike of the Appalachian Trail next week and I will post again how well the powermonkey solar charger worked for us when we get back.  That being said about the solar panel, the wall charger worked great to charge the powermonkey and I was able to fully charge several devices and I still had power left over.  Hopefully after our trip I can change my rating from 3 to 5 stars.",3,2
"The first unit I received stopped working within an hour after I received it. No sound, regardless of whether I used bluetooth or wired connection. To my amazement, however, the same day I initially posted this review I got a call from the president of Cambridge Soundworks, apologizing and asking if they could send a replacement unit. Really outstanding customer service.<br /><br />The new unit works, with impressively full sound quality for such a small, inexpensive speaker. The bluetooth connection is functional, but sometimes requires a couple of tries before connecting. Switching between bluetooth and line-in is a bit erratic as well, but with fiddling it works. The speaker beeps and crackles while waiting for the bluetooth connection, which is a bit distracting--but the beeping and crackling vanishes once the connection is made and the music starts playing.<br /><br />The speaker comes with a nice little carrying case.<br /><br />All in all, not bad for the price, if you don't mind playing around a bit to get the connection.",3,1
Easy install.  Not very great on picking up reception in certain areas.,3,1
"This case provides good, clear thin and lightweight protective backing for Ipod Touch 4th generation. You can't tell that it's on when it's on other than the annoying \\""Case Crown\\"" namebrand on the back.<br /><br />It does not cover cover the front as I had hoped though it does cover a bit of the sides.<br /><br />Since it's so thin and lightweight, I don't plan to test the case by dropping the Ipod or anything.<br /><br />Honestly, the price and value was great and it does look just fine on my Ipod without adding any unnecessary bulk. It was almost impossible to find a clear, transparent case for Ipod Touch 4th generation. (The description says that this is for Ipod Touch 4 in the subject but then Ipod Touch 5 elsewhere. Very confusing.)<br /><br />Also, unlike most of these cheap cases you find on Amazon, this product came with expensive looking packaging materials and a really posh box and case. Very different from those shady little baggies you get with similarly priced cases for cell phones and MP3 players.<br /><br />***Although the case provides great access to all the other buttons, it's a bit close to the power button for comfort. I'm always touching the case and the button at the same time and that's a bit uncomfortable though it really depends on how/where you access the power button from. Sometimes you notice it, sometimes you don't.",3,1

"This camera is a decent value for the price.  However, if you're expecting $200+ hi def image quality in this $50 camera, you're going to be disappointed.<br /><br />Also, be aware that there are a lot of inferior knock-offs of this model out there - mine included the HDMI port and appeared to be one of the \\""good\\"" ones.<br /><br />Default resolution is 1920x1080 25 fps motion jpeg format, and I'm guessing it's upscaled.  3 minute video clips at that resolution result in average file sizes of about 450MB so you could fit about 36 clips onto a 16G memory card (100-110 minutes) before it started recording over files.<br /><br />Daytime video quality is good for a camera in this price range.<br /><br />But unless you've got lots of external illumination (i.e. lots of streetlights), this camera is almost completely useless for recording at night.  On a dark road with low beams the camera might be able to record an image of something within 20 feet or so of your car, but with high beams on the resulting video is almost completely dark.<br /><br />As others have noted, the documentation is terrible.  I found how to enable auto recording when power is applied to the camera through another review here (thanks, Charon9!).  But other than that, most of the functions on the camera are self-explanatory.<br /><br />I returned mine because half of my commuting is at night on rural roads and the lack of night recording capability made this camera unsuitable for me.",3,2
"These headrest monitors are OK.  a few issues.  they are so heavy that they tilt backwards and you have to place some type of wedge between the seat and the headrest to keep them up.  also, the plastic inserts are useless in installation.

"This is not a snap in place part. It does not fit in the opening after you remove the oem light. It will take some modifying to get it to fit properly. As for the camera itself, it works fine and has a clear picture. I will update this review if any problems arise after it has been subjected to the elements.",3,2

"When I compared armbands for my i Pod by reviewing comments and comparing price, this seemed like the best trade off.  I haven't used it much yet, but so far I like the fit and handiness.

No pick-up from spoke magnet.  Second, if you have more tha one cadience device on different bikes you must do a MASTER FORETREX RESET to move between cadience devices(bikes). You do this by turning foretrex off then holding down ENTER AND POWER BUTTON at same time.  Foretrex 401 only.  Thank you. Love the device.",3,1

this bumper is great.. but for the 4s you have to melt the hole where the sound switch is because it lays right on it.... for $6.. worth the effort... :) i got it in purple too... and they last about 3 months each.... and i dropped my phone many many times b/c i'm a clutz and it withstands the drops pretty well.. the purple one i finally i had to retire... but worth the $ for sure.,3,1
"Sound from this speaker is great! Nice bass and Bluetooth syncs fast.

Very strange problem. It only affects a couple of apps. Works great with my iTunes! I'm keeping it.",3,1
I ended up throwing it away.  It had some rough edges and it didn't look nice . I have been told it is the new design on the iPod cases to have the more open end on the bottom corner but  I just couldn't use It with that  jagged edge. But it was cute.,3,2

It is OK. It didn't stand up to the rough Adventure rides.  The post broke on and adventure ride and I nearly lost my GPS.

"The case is good protection for my ipod, but I can't seem to get the kickstand to open, I am afraid I might break it if I pull too hard.",3,2
Works okay. Sound quality leaves much to be desired. Battery life is impressive. Not a bad deal for the price but there are better options out there if you are willing to spend a little more.,3,2
"I had this mp4 for three days now. But somehow i couldn't play video file on it. I try different converter, AVS Converter, MP4 Tool, ZC Converter, Video MP4 Converter, I convert my video file to AVI XVID 320x240 it keep saying FILE FORMAT ERROR.",3,2

"I bought this key case because I thought it would be nice to have a flip key for my 2009 Honda CIVIC.  However, after I had it cut, I ran into two issues:<br /><br />1. The transponder didn't work with this key, I was able to start my car, but I couldn't drive it because the transponder missing light was on.<br />2. The key shape doesn't work with the ignition and I had to break the case to turn the vehicle off.  This was because the width was greater than the recessed portion of the ignition and I couldn't push it in to turn the key all the way off.<br /><br />The quality is excellent and the shipping was prompt, it just isn't made for this make an model car.",3,2
"The good:<br />It's a pretty good mirror, very clear, big, much bigger than you standard mirror, which might be good or bad depending on your car. There is no dimming function though at all, so it might not be so good at night.<br />It attaches very securely to your existing mirror using rubber straps and suction cups, so there is no chance of it falling off if you hit a pothole or anything.<br />If you route the cables right, it's pretty hard to see from outside that you have a camera in the car as it does just look like a mirror unless you inspect it closely. The camera itself is shiny silver, but you can paint it with a black sharpie if you want to make it even harder to detect.<br />The audio it records is pretty good. The mic picks up all inside conversations and outside noises, so pretty much anything that you hear in the car it will record. Thus you can record conversations with police during stops, etc if needed.<br />It records a pretty wide angle, so you can see the entire road and everything to the sides of the road.<br /><br />The bad:<br />The video quality is pretty bad. At 1080p, it will noticeably skip frames and sometimes the frame rate you get is pretty bad. The quality isn't really any clearer over 720p, so I would recommend ignoring 1080p at all.<br />At 720p, you get very smooth video, but the quality still leaves a lot to be desired. It's pretty grainy, with very bad transitions between sun and shade. You cannot make out license plate numbers of the cars in front of you except in ideal conditions and when it's right up there close to you. Also, you might get reflections of the dashboard depending on how the sun is shining.<br />When transitioning from one file to the next, it will skip a couple of frames. Not really that big a deal, but still would be nice to see smooth transitions.<br /><br />Other:<br />By default it came with motion detection enabled. What this does is stop recording whenever you stop and then start recording again when youstart going. So at every red light, stop sign, etc it will stop and then start recording again into a new file. This is very annoying and you will get a lot of stuff skipped that you might have wanted to record if something happens when you're stopped. I recommend just turning this off completely.",3,2
the screen protector is super thin and you can hardly tell it's there but i do have a rainbow effect that i am not happy with.  i feel the rainbow effect really diminishes the screen quality of the iphone 4.,3,2
"Love the looks of my new \\""bling\\"" case but it keeps snapping off which is a pain. This is the second case I have tried that snaps on the ipod touch and both had the same problem. I won't be looking for another one to waste money on.",3,2
"Thought it was great after it was installed, but.  One week after installation the channel presets keep clearing out, and I think I reset them 5 times within a few days. Very frustrating after spending more than a similar system cost.  Also, on the same preset screen, &#34;Receiving...&#34; shows up, like it is searching for a Bluetooth signal or something, and I can't even get to the controls to change a channel or see what station is on.  I had to turn the radio Off several times already when this happens. Then, while trying to reset the preset channels after I get that screen back up, the memory will not accept the preset channel.  After a few reboots it will take, but then after a few engine starts, it seems the presets are gone again.  The Bluetooth function hasn't had any issues, Pandora works fine, many more channels available on the radio, and the backup camera is great and has a nice clear picture, but something is wrong with the regular radio screen. Hope it is a temporary thing. Otherwise I do like it.",3,2
"Just purchased this item and first I want to point out shipping was very slow, I didn't receive the product until about a week and a half to 2 weeks after I bought it. Clock works well as long as it's daylight, at night the backlight is barely visible and you can't read the numbers. Also the temperature is in celcius which didn't bother me but it may others, if you want to use it as a thermometer.  The clock pulls down my air vents if I hit a bump on the road so I'm constantly having to adjust it. All in all it works but it could be greatly improved.",3,2
Thanks,3,1
"Not a bad game, overall, but next to no resemblance to actual history.  Yes, there was a war and yes, Germany, Britain, the USA and USSR etc were involved, but that's about as far as historical accuracy goes.  I've played it several times as several different countries and, in various games, Italy has declared war on Germany on the first turn, Germany has gone to war with Romania and Bulgaria, even Great Britain has declared war on the US! In one particularly bizarre session, France declared war on Argentina for some unfathomable reason.<br />That being said, I still play occasionally, mainly because I can alter the characteristics of each nation in so many different ways; population, resources, technology, weapons, form of government and political leaning, to name some.  I probably enjoy setting up the game more than I actually enjoy playing it, because game play is just so arbitrary and unpredictable.<br />If you're looking for an accurate simulation of WWII, take a pass on this game.  If you like to tinker, you'll probably like it.",3,1
"This unit plays surprisingly loud for an unpowereed speaker.  The highs are relatively clear and discernable.  The lows....well you need power to reproduce low frequencies.  So if you want ambient music in a quiet place, this is a nice solution.  If you want bass and higher fidelity, spend a good deal more money and expect to use more space in your backpack.",3,1
I guess you just get what you pay for.  I was satisfied by the product for the price but it is cheaply made.  Since it was for my daughter I wasn't going to spend too much money.,3,2
very difficult to get FRS to work the APP to use FRS is weak no help info. The phone seems fine I have not got a SIM card for it I was hoping to duplicate my card. But this phone is WCDMA not CDMA probably good for asia or europe. Would be nice if phone had a clip to wear on self,3,2
The box our stop sign was in had a 1/8 inch bed of sand in it from the base unit.  We're still going to use it because the height of the sign makes it easy for my wife to see.  It was a Christmas present so that's why it took a bit of time to reply.,3,1

I have never seen such an inexpensively manufactured product. It is amazing that it works but it does. I use mine to play cd's before i go to sleep. It does the job. I would never think that it could go on the road for a walk or a bike ride; it would just not function.,3,1
My son wanted this because of the stand. It is nice looking not sure how long it will last. I would buy again,3,1
"This speaker can get pretty loud despite its small size and connects to Bluetooth quickly.<br />The Play/Pause button is not very sensitive and when pressed, there is sort of a significant lag between when it is pressed and when it actually pauses. The Volume Up/Down works well with no lag in between.<br />The battery life doesn't last as long as advertised (6 hours), it seems like it needs to be charged after 4 hours.<br />There should be a light or some other type of indicator to notify if this device is on/off. It would be too easy to leave these speakers on and coming back to it later without any batteries left in it",3,1
"The device is pretty nice for the price.  I did expect it to be a little better than it is but it's \\""OK\\"".    I assumed with all of the video features that it would allow \\""album art\\"" when adding music.  NOPE...it doesn't.  I also thought that any video or movie that is converted through the converstion software would work.  I haven't found ONE yet.  No video or movie that I have attempted to put on this device works.  If anyone has any movies that has worked for them please pass it on.    Other than those two issues I guess it's a pretty good buy.  Unless you are highly depending on using the video/movie option.  Other than that...it holds a ton of music and you can expand.  It's lightweight and user friendly. I found other features by going to the \\""setting\\"" icon.  There you can set up EQ, Shuffle, Repeat etc.",3,1
"I purchased two of these book armor cases for use with the nook color. I liked the idea of the hard case to protect the nook. However,the \\""click strips\\"" included to keep the nook safely in the case, would not adhere to the back of the nook, despite following the directions exactly. I called the company to tell them this and they were very nice and promptly sent us new strips. Unfortunately, these strips did not adhere either. So, instead of sending the cover back, we used regular velcro and the cover works great! I like that I can fold the cover over which makes it easier to hold the nook,which is fairly heavy.  So I decide to keep the book armor and it is working just great.",3,1

"I bought this armband to use while cycling 20-30 miles (1.5 -2.5 hours) to hold my Nexus One phone. The band works as described. I found that the band did not ride up or down from my sleeve which was good. I have been using the band in 50 degree weather and have found that my body heat mixing with the cold air allowed into the case (by way of the four small holes used to allow headphone access) tends to create condensation inside the case which actually was forming and falling on and around the phone. After seeing this I have stopped using the band. If you are looking for something to wear in cold weather I'd skip this product. If you are riding in temperate to hot weather, I'd recommend removing your device from the band before going into an air-conditioned space.",3,1

Radio to radio seems OK. Range maybe 1 mile. Does not perform as well going thru a repeater. This is used in the 460 mhz range with an FCC license for the frequencies used. I do like the simplicity of it when others are using it. Not a lot of knobs or buttons to confuse a new user.,3,2

"After a while looking for a case for my ipod classic 160(2009 version)I decided to give this one a try. The black material is stretchy and gives a very nice snug fit. It also has a belt clip on the back which you can take on or off so you can lay it flat. The front is made of clear plastic, making it just about impossible to operate my click wheel while in the case. Since its such a stretchy tight fit itd definatly be a hassle to take it on and off whenever you want to use the click wheel. I actually cut the plastic so the wheel wasnt covered but left it where the ipods screen is. Thats why I have a mix review of it. I like it now that Ive modified it, but if you dont want to mess with a case maybe you should keep looking.",3,2

"If you've got an Aux jack, consider yourself lucky. The rest of us have to use FM transmitters and cassette tape converters. This version of the RoadTrip, pretty outdated as of 4-03-10, does a good job at what it's supposed to do. Well, when you don't hit any bumps on the road. The RoadTrip has a major flaw in that the weight of the unit causes it to pop out every now and then on the road. A pain in the rear when you have to turn up the volume to hear your music only to have the unit dislodge itself and the speakers blast loud static into your ears. It happens every now and then and I have to pull the unit out and reseat it.     When it works, it works well, even if the frequency you have it set on has a radio station broadcasting on that already. But it really needed something to keep the unit in place. Maybe that's why there's a new RoadTrip out and this one only costs $12.",3,1

"Does a tremendous job protecting the iPod, case fits snugly and with precision. My only complaint is regarding the plastic cover on the menu wheel, maybe it is my particular iPod (brand new classic gen 7) but the sensitivity to the control wheel was very low, to the point of turning into an annoyance to do something simple like adjust volume. Saw a presentation in YouTube where the wheel appears to respond properly - again, this case works just right to provide the iPod with a durable protective skin, prospective buyers perhaps should test drive before buying or make sure a return policy is set with a given seller in case things don't work as expected.",3,1
"Pros:<br />Good video/audio.<br />Nice features, motion detect, GPS, loop recording, G-shock setting/calibration.<br />Internal memory option.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Should not be used in a car with temperatures below freezing, or above 100F.<br />The mount does not swivel.<br />No suction cup mount.<br />Limited memory card specs. (i.e. Class 10 card is too fast) (REALLY?).<br /><br />So, if you live in the U.S., and the sun shines in your area. Don't leave this camera in your car. Also if the temperature dips below freezing or the moisture in the air condenses inside the camera, damage may occur.<br />The mount, My windshield angle is such that with the camera mounted on the glass, the center of the screen shows the transition point between my hood and the road. Even a 15 degree swivel mount would have made this better. Also, I'm thinking if the sun shines in your area, the temperature will easily go above 100F. This would probably loosen the glue from the mount, and or melt the camera housing/parts. That in itself makes this camera unsuitable for a car.",3,1

I selected this product because I thought it was also a charger.  I didn't find it originally on Amazon.  I found it on another website that took me to Amazon.  The other website said it had a charger.  I was disappointed when I received it and it didn't have charging capabilities.  I went back to Amazon's website and it did not say it was a charger.  The first website was misleading but I should have checked again on Amazon before purchasing.  It is a nice product and works well but I was specifically looking for one with a charger.,3,2
"I got this mainly for the radio.  I was hoping listen to my favorite radio   station at work. After reading the many reviews stating  that radio reception was excellent, I was a little disappointed  to find that, I could not access my favorite radio station,  then to \\""add insult to injury\\"", I was collasping the antena  one day and it broke off in my hand. Bear in mind, I only had this for 4 days. Some quality, if I had bought this from a Retail Store, I'd be returning it Immedaitly.

Pro: This case/skin works and fits well. It will protect your Ipod.    Con: This case/skin looks very cheap! The red is dull and lifeless. Nothing says cheap like a Dollar store snap on case to protect your hundred dollar Ipod!,3,1
"The case fits nicely and all the cut-outs are precise and don't hinder performance. There are two slits in the back of the case for the armband, which isn't a big deal if you're going to use the armband. The armband is a nice plus if you don't want to buy a whole separate case for running and working out. However, if you're someone with large muscular arms, I'm guessing the armband would not fit. The color of the case itself is nice, but from the picture I was expecting it to be a little bit bolder and more opaque.  When I put the case on I did notice a small rip in the silicone near one of the cut-out slits on the back. Its not bad, and my ipod is still fully protected, but it is supposed to be a brand new case. The screen protector is great, I would definitely recommend getting one for any ipod touch owner. Also, I did not receive the advertised lanyard. I don't need the lanyard, but the purchase was supposed to include one. Overall, the case and screen protector are great and I probably will use the armband. I'm pretty satisfied for the price that I paid. The quality matches the price, however, so if you're looking for something high quality you should probably spend more.",3,1
The camera did not have any instructions in the box and language was defaulted to Chinese.  It was a struggle getting it into English but was able to navigate the menu once in English.<br />Cheap is not a descriptive enough word for the quality of this camera but it does work as advertised and at the price is as good as can be expected.,3,2

"PRO: Price decreased from $51 to $39 while I had it on my wish list.<br />Received G1W in aprox 12 days. Not too bad for overseas.<br />Build quality is okay but expected based on reading reviews from myriad sites and YouTube videos.<br />LCD screen quality was also okay.<br /><br />07/18: Video was set for 720p, just reviewed tonight on desktop PC. Video quality was good but does not resemble vid quality seen on youtube reviews. Will experiment with 1080 mode. Useing 32 gb Sandisk class 4 microSD card. Slight fishbowl effect on the extreme left and right.<br /><br />07/26: Changed video to 1080p and compared to 720p version. Only marginal improvement in resolution. License plate has improved resolution. File size increased aprox 30%. I will keep it at 1080p.<br /><br />Enclosed windshield mount has a versatile 360 degree ball joint for ease of mounting and angling the lens. The mounting slot has an additional modification that allows you to 'lock' the dash cam and stabilizes the dash cam with the mount.<br /><br />Enclosed power adapter has longer than normal length of wire. I was able to hide the wire in the headliner and 'A' pillar interior panel. I secured it a switched post in the fuse box with 'add a circuit' fuse tap. Creates auto on/off function when turning vehicle on and off.<br /><br />CON: User manual was poorly written in 'chinglish', incomplete without even a diagram of the unit. Only minimally covered the features and button functions on the unit. I was aware of the crummy manual but I did expect a DIAGRAM of the dash cam!<br /><br />The unit has a red/green led power light above left side up/down arrow buttons. This feature has never been discussed or remarked upon in my research efforts.<br /><br />07/20: This is the power light for the dash cam. Red when on and green when the auto is off and the dash cam battery is powering the unit. It turns off in a few minutes. Problem is that the red light can remain on until the auto is turned off OR it can turn off in a few minutes while the auto is still on. The dash cam is still recording but you have to press the up/down button to activate the screen to confirm this.<br /><br />Earlier attempts to communicate with seller was unsuccessful. The seller referred me back to the inadequate user manual. Obviously a case of 'you get what you pay for', you have to do some self education from youtube videos.<br /><br />CAVEAT, the software menu differs from other G1W demo's on youtube. Raising my rating from 2 to 3 stars.",3,1
Got these about a month ago. Easy to use with my iphone. These are just ok. Music sounds pretty good but even with my phone on me at times the signal gets a little choppy cutting out a bit. Same problem when I'm on the phone. They are fairly comfortable but after an hour they do start feeling uncomfortable. Could use a more comfortable insert as far as that goes.,3,1
It wasn't what I was really wanting but it will do. I received it promptly. I would consider buying again.,3,1

I didn't think the case would fit because it's really small, but I put it on and it fit. Its a loose fit and kind of flimsy, can come off easily but it does what its supposed to. It has a really smooth feel to it and feels great, I just wish it gripped tighter so it wouldn't come off so easily. Decent case overall.",3,1
"I love this little speaker! It has great bass for the size and plays relatively loud. BUT battery life is very poor, lasting me only around an hour and a half. I charged the device over night and the red light never turned off showing that it was fully charged which was strange. Is anyone else experiencing this problem? It could be that I have a defective product so I'm considering sending it back.",3,1
"Overall, this is worth the money for the skin as it fits well and certainly protects the device.    My issue with this is that the screen protector was not the proper size. This means you'll have to cut it yourself and as such it doesn't stick quite perfectly on one side. It's surprising to me that the protector isn't the right side considering the skin is perfect.",3,1
"Like other reviews this is not 4GA, more like 6GA, is copper coated aluminum.  The RCA cable included is very flimsy but may work ok.  I would only recommend for small amp with short power cable runs and lower power use like 50X2W max.  No need to trash this product.  If you need to do a quality install you just have to pay more.  For heavier duty install in car trunk (long cable runs) I recently used a Kicker 100% Copper kit I got from Warehouse Deals (repacked customer return) for about twice the price and it was a great deal.  Shop around but if you are looking for a quality 4GA kit, keep looking.",3,2

Ok,3,1
I had alot of problems setting this mic up for the first time. the sound was not too good but after messing with it for a few outs (4 hours) it turned out to be an ok microphone.     The Stand is unstable and with a pop filter it can fall over easy.   I must say the sound could be better but its not bad.    Recormend saving for a better mic if you are looking.,3,2
I love the pattern but I did not like that it was not an actual case. The only thing this print does for your ipod is keep scratches off of it. It has no drop protection and I forgot to mention it is a cute print.,3,1
This camera good for recording all the time - and help specify who really caused an accident. Think of late night cases without witnesses - cops often (may be) toss a coin to decide who really went thru the red light - you or the other guy who hit you! Should be some day standard and built-in for all cars! As for the model ... works overall - but I need to mention tiny buttons (hard to operate - you almost need to memorize what's what) and unfriendly manual - hard to follow their instructions. They should also have included the memory card.,3,1
"Plays good, but was not constructed very well. Falling apart.",3,2
"I got this for $20, which is quite a bit less than its debut price. It's good as a small room speaker for an iPod or iPhone, it can turn an old iPod into a nice clock radio just by being a powered speaker.<br /><br />It plays mp3 on USB or SD card, but, sadly, not DRM-free mp4 (m4a). So most iTunes music won't play. Sound is quite nice at low volume by our non-demanding standards.<br /><br />One minor surprise -- there's no power supply. Most of us have many USB power supplies around so that's not a big problem, but for the original price that would be disappointing. I had an unused BlackBerry phone charger with a mini-USB jack that works quite well.<br /><br />I dropped one star for lack of a power supply (based on the original price) and one star for not supporting non-FairPlay m4a.",3,1
Quality ok but not great but price is good. Battery operated--no adaptor came with this player.,3,1
"I purchased this to replace the one I had that would not power on, this one does not power off. Thats still better than no sound at all so I kept it. Chance you take when you buy used I guess.",3,2
"Both my husband and I had to perform several attempts to get this on the front of our Verizon iPhone4 phones (neither of us are using it on the backs of our phones).  We each still have a few visible, small bubbles along the outer edges (took multiple application attempts to get rid of the bubbles in the middle) which are supposed to work their way out w/time, but not sure that will actually happen.  Regardless, our phones work just as if there was no film on them which is great.  My opinion = these show fingerprints and makeup smears (having phone pressed against my cheek)as much as just the phone screen itself and you have to wipe harder to get rid of, but I like the fact its protecting the phone itself, so for now, I will continue to use.  My actual rating is a 3.5.",3,1
"works ok but really needs some design improvments.transmitter works well,good sound.the lighter/holder doesnt work well at all.I purchased a different one after using this for a couple of days.",3,1
"Awesome price for the features offered. I would have preferred a removable faceplate over the whole deck but Pyramid did not offer the other features I wanted with that option. As a loyal cassette \\""Player\\"", I shopped for the accessory input jack so that I can use my CD and MP3 players with the deck. The opposite capability is not easy or typical. Downward/backward compatibility is never easy to find; this forces the consumer into puchases the don't always want or need. Thank you Pyramid for your devotion to the classics.",3,1
Absolutely the worst documentation that I have ever seen !  They changed the wiring harness and added a wire<br />with no explination of what its for or where it goes.  Their minmal wiring diagram does not even show it.<br />There is no explination of the controls functions either.,3,2
"The device itself works very well. My only complaint is in the product design. The weight of the device, added with the weight of the phone, make it prone to falling from the plug-in. the best way to use is to align the unit so that the phone can rest on the console or seat attached to the headphone wire. This technique, however, removes the ability to charge the unit.",3,1
these screens look like they will last on your I phone. I got these for something other than an i phone and have been keeping up.,3,1
Everything works just fine.  All of the items feel cheaply made.  Really no complaints though.,3,1
"I really like the GSI Quality Waterproof Bluetooth Intercom System for Motorcycles/Motorbikes - The 2-Way Radio and Bluetooth works great. The only problem is the helmet clip. I have use glue, powerful adhesives and it stays on until I bump helmet against something and it breaks again. This becomes frustrating, especially after 5 breaks. Therefore, in my opinion I suggest not to purchase this item find another.",3,1
One of the radios has continous statiic but the the battery last a long time. I would recommend this to a friend.,3,1
Hubby not too excited about it.  But it will work.  We just haven't had the chance to try it yet though.,3,2
"As a buyer of well-over 300 Baofeng radios (and counting) for the group I belong to (not all of which were purchased through Amazon but many were), I'm always amazed at the lengths some sellers go to to hype their products as being \\""newer\\"" or \\""better\\"" than other models, or perhaps (to give them the benefit of the doubt) they just don't know any better.<br /><br />First, the Baofeng UV-5R series (including the original and still extremely popular UV-5R, I'll explain why in a minute) is what is normally referred to by many as a SDR radio (or software defined radio).  While not a true SDR product (you can't use it with your computer to control the radio's functions or scan a wide amount of VHF/UHF frequencies with it), none the less a large chip is programmed on the circuit board built inside each radio.  That chip determines what capability the radio itself can perform.<br /><br />Every UV-5R series radio has the ability to transmit from 136-174 MHz on VHF and from 400-520 MHz on UHF in both narrow-band and wide-band modes (very useful for the occasional FRS or MURS use, which requires narrow-band mode to work correctly).<br /><br />Every model does \\""at least\\"" 4W on VHF/UHF from the factory, but occasionally you'll get a batch that does 4.5W or even 5W out, but the difference between 4W and 5W is minimal at best.  A 4W radio with a better antenna will easily outperform a 5W radio with the standard crappy antenna that Baofeng ships on ALL (including the UV-5RA, -5RAX, and -5RAX+) models.<br /><br />Baofeng DOES NOT program those chips any differently for the UV-5R vs. any other UV-5R series (including the UV-5RA).  Version 307 of the firmware (which is the most current release I have in any of my radios) works EXACTLY the same way as previous older releases of firmware at least back to the 295 release (over a year ago), so any claim from a seller that this release provides additional features (at least from a user's perspective) is simply BOGUS, since the firmware inside both radios have the same features.  In fact, my UV-5R radios with the 307 firmware release is EXACTLY the same radio (inside and within the firmware) as my UV-5RA radios with the 307 firmware release.<br /><br />Second, you CANNOT in any way upgrade the firmware (unless you count buying a different radio and it comes with a different firmware release), so again the claim in the listing from some sellers that you can is simply BOGUS.<br /><br />Third, you can believe that two thinner pieces (glued or screwed together on the faceplate of the UV-5RA) is somehow stronger than one thicker piece of plastic (on the original UV-5R series) if you like (and maybe it is), but I haven't seen that in real-world use from my own UV-5RA units.  The standard UV-5R units that we use seem to hold up just as well (when dropped in the desert dirt or rolling down a hill) as any other Baofeng radio we own and use.<br /><br />Fourth, and my biggest issue with all of the non-standard UV-5RA, UV-5RAX and UV-5RAX+ units, is that NONE of the Baofeng battery accessories (except the little 1800 mAh standard battery) work WITHOUT modification (unless you use a Dremel tool to grind or cut off part of your extended battery that works on the standard UV-5R - but won't work on your UV-5RA, UV-5RAX or UV-5RAX+).<br /><br />Getting new UV-5RA units that don't work with Extended 3800 mAh batteries (without modification) doesn't make my group happy.  That may not bother you, but NONE of the sellers of the non-standard UV-5RA, UV-5RAX, and UV-5RAX+ units ever seem to mention that lack of hardware compatibility in their listings, so buyer beware!<br /><br />BTW, NONE of the \\""AA\\"" or \\""AAA\\"" battery shell packs work on the UV-5RA, UV-5RAX, or UV-5RAX+ units either, so that's 3 different battery accessories (including the 3800 mAh extended battery) that you can't use on these radios without hacking them with a Dremel tool (but they all work without modification on the original UV-5R units).<br /><br />So \\""if\\"" you want a \\""pretty\\"" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (or -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.  Oh, you should see how well that shiny faceplate lights up when a flashlight hits it in the dark, just the thing you don't want for night use.<br /><br />Virtually every guy in our group ends up carrying a standard UV-5R and giving the UV-5RA, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ to the wife or kids, since the wife and/or kids rarely care about the other accessories working and they (the wife and kids) tend to like the \\""pretty\\"" radios, but again there is NO INTERNAL difference and NO EXTRA FEATURES in the UV-5RA, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ units (other than a different looking shiny faceplate) vs. the original and still wildly popular UV-5R (which I refer to as the M16 of radios, as all the accessories you match it up with just plain work).<br /><br />Now you know the real background on these radios.f\\"" you want a \\""pretty\\"" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (or -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.

"This speaker has decent sound, but for me it popped in between songs and when turning on and off, and when connecting. Seemed to connect ok, but at times would drop too. Not sure if I received a dud or not.",3,2
The sound quality for the most part is very good but the unit is cheaply put together and after a few uses with the SD slot it won't hold the card anymore.,3,2
This is an OK mount. The piece that holds your device sits on the arm with a sort of hook like mechanism that can't lock. If you bump the mount or hit a big pothole your ipad/phone will end up banged up on the floor. I've learned to deal with it but my wife would prefer to throw the entire thing out the window.,3,1
"This product will work, if you wrap your iPhone in a clear wrap product first, I purchased an iWrap system. By wrapping the iPhone first I created a snug fit in the case that will do 3 things: 1. keeps the case from flexing which I believe leads to its self-unlatching 2. keeps out small particles 3. if a small particle does get in, the phone won't scratch.    I don't use the belt clip because I don't like hanging $400 off my person. But I did try it and found the clip useless. The belt clip that doubles as a stand, unlatches from itself and goes into stand mode allowing the phone to swing out from the body. Not good! What is good, the clip is removable.    Also, if you buy this case you won't be able to use the iPhone docking station.  You will have to purchase a USB sync cable.    I still like this product for the following reasons: 1. Aesthetics of the iPhone are preserved 2. Plastic acts as an additional shock absorber.",3,2
I just got the sub's today so I have not had a chance to put power to them yet. Unboxing I felt like a kid on Christmas. the sub's appear to be well put together Great design and material. they are nice and stiff and have a little more weight to them then I thought they would.after a few days I will let you know how they handle with the power going to them just by Design alone I would not hesitate to buy more the subs.(update) I have been running power to them for a while now and they are sweet just wish the would hit the lows a little better but still better then a lot of other choices out there if I had it to do over I think I would still go with soundstream hope this helps,3,1
it is just a piece of plastic and it shoud cost 0.99 .  It is only good to run and do work out,3,1
did not seem to help at all will mayby try gain but don't think it will clear the problem on vsr,3,2
Good amp for the price. Doesn't push my 12 nearly as hard as I thought it would. The bass control remote don't work also.,3,1
Nice cover fits perfectly.,3,1
"So, I do love this product but I've purchased 2 in the last year and the side handles on both devices busted within a week of owning it. It doesn't interfere with how the device works but instead of it being secured it just hangs from the plug and is annoying.",3,1
"Showed up before the estimated delivery time. The stylus isn't quite what I expected, but does the job. The case itself, sometimes it has a tough time standing up vertivally because of the material. but it still does the job :)",3,1
Not super protective but it fits nice and I liked it for what its worth.,3,1
"Very good product. The pictures and videos are clear as long as you are against some good lighting. I really like the text option on it, it saves where you left off. One thing: no clock. I mean some don't and some do but it would be great if it had one. The games part: ??? I don't know what to put and it doesn't come with a game so that part is useless. The speaker is low too.",3,2
"When I received my items, I was missing 3 items. They sent me a note stating that when the items come in they will ship my my items. I have been waiting for about four months for those 3 items and I still have not received them yet.",3,1
Too much going in and out and fuzzy and muffled sounds. Would not recommend to anyone.  I guess you get what you pay for but I did expect more!,3,2
The clip is not strong enough.  I attach it to the band of my pants and it will slip off.,3,1
"My 3 year old son LOVES TMNT which is why I bought this player as a birthday gift for him.  While it does work, it isn't that easy to work - sometimes you have to push the play button a couple of times for the CD player portion to actually work.  I'm 28, so if I can't get it to work by pushing the button once, imagine a 3 year old's frustrations...",3,1
"I purchased these to replace another pair of earphones of which one side went mute. (To use on both a Sony Walkman AM/FM Radio and Sony Walkman MP3 Player/FM Radio)<br /><br />I wouldn't expect them to have the best sound quality as far as bass, treble etc...especially for the price and not quite sure if the straight jack, as this one has, is better than the L shaped - which at least keeps the jack lower and to a specific side of your choice.<br /><br />Overall for the price, they're fine, but if you need something with top notch quality for music alone, I would look elsewhere.",3,1

"We are going on a 3,000 mile road trip and this will be a god send for our iphone and Tablet.",3,1
When I ordered this Ipod I only ordered 1. I only received 1 iPod but the next day I received another leaving me with 2 ipods.,3,2
It's an acceptable product except it has no Bluetooth. Yes that's right no Bluetooth... It does have a remote that comes with it which I'm still waiting to use. And I can only get one radio frequency... One really boring channel... There's about 10-15 radio channels around. It does have the vibration thing and that works fine. The vibration works like a charm! This product is a little overpriced. Hence it does not have the above features... I would pay maybe $40-45 for it because it does not have Bluetooth. Overall i was disappointed after paying $60 for this product.,3,2
"So I installed this, it comes with directions which I used it still doesn't work. It will charge my GSIII but not much else. I installed the Appradio app and it doesn't do anything either. I would recommend you don't buy this, Pioneer includes no direction on how to get to work on an Android phone. Which is stupid, Android is 90% of the phone market worldwide and all Pioneer develops for is the iPhone.",3,2
The case was shipped right away and I received it in two days. The design is cute/contemporary my only gripes are the 1. The cut out for the camera is not close enough it affects the picture. When I take a picture with the case it comes out with a yellow hue -so I need to remove the case everytime I want to take a picture. 2. The cut out for the charger is a little to close sometimes the phone will not recognize the charger because of the case is in the way. All in all I like the case but it could be a little slimmer.,3,2
"This is a tough one. The amp and sub work great and the sound is what I expected. However, WHO ships a 12&#34; amp with a 10&#34; box????? WHO?? It's a really nice box too, it's just worthless for this application. Weighs about 30 lbs, so good going with the shipping waste. Sorry but I had to have another box for a 12&#34; built in haste at a cost of $90. It wasn't half the box the one shipped was...shame.",3,2
"Sound quality is good. Battery life is short(possiblely due to the large screen).  This is an okay mp3 player.  But the relatively short battery life and the fact that it is nearly impossible to operate with one hand, make it much less useful when on the go.  I bought my wife a Zune (30gb) and now I want one.",3,1
I bought this for my second vehicle so I could switch my radio between them. The package did reach in good time but when installing I realized the screws where missing. Had to try and get the right size but the &#34;silver&#34; against the black just looks out of place. It works and that counts.,3,1
"it certainly works, but only for a short while on one triple A battery, if you want something that'll last, I wouldn't recommend it, but if you just want something cheap to use when you go on a run, it'll do the job",3,1
The product is good for the price. came with remote which I was surprised with. I use it with USB. I hate the part that it always starts from song 1. even if you start engine.,3,1
"Does what it says. It plugged in to the device, then it plugged in to the wall, then it charged...",3,2
"It's really pretty cool wenI first got it, the touch is ok, and the video will be pretty good when you have a lot of light in the room. it's just  simple mp4 player to me. so I like it",3,1
"Product works great when it works.  I've found it to be temperamental when charging, sometimes it will charge quickly others it can be plugged in overnight and the light will not be green or red.  I purchased 7 and 2 have had these problems that I know of.  Next time I will spend a few more dollars to get a better product.",3,1
"I bought this for my niece, thinking it was a cute bunny case, however, when it arrived, it kind of reminded me of playboy because of the color and the tail, so I probably wouldn't order it again, at least not for a kid. I buy affordable cases for her whenever I see a cute one and this is the lowest quality one I have received. It was cheap, but I've bought others for the same price that are much nicer. The silicone is thin and kind of flimsy. Looks cheap, I don't know about the tail because it's not her favorite case so it doesn't get used that much.",3,2
good screen for price easy to install. its cheap for sure but it works. it shipped fast and has few glithces the screen flickers some times and it cracks eassy but it is a good deal.,3,1
"I bought this to use with DVD player and blue tooth head phones. There is considerable delay in the sound. Its not fun watching movies or television. With only music it is fine, since you are only listening and not watching on the TV screen.",3,1
I have a Yamaha rx v465 reciever and a 80gb ipod classic. hooked this up very easily. Works fine for general use but don't expect great sound. I would check into the Pure i 20 dock...about the same price and has a onboard digital converter. Like i said...general use is fine. I have lossless files. Wish i would have done some research before buying.,3,1
"It was okay because it was a little tight on the iTouch, and after a while it started to chip, so, the bottom was white while the rest had the zebra print.",3,2
The case was just as it looked in the pictures.  One thing to note is that there isn't the option of videoing while looking at what you are recording.  The case doesn't allow it.,3,2
"The FM tuner using the included \\""Bonus\\"" antenna had fairly weak reception.  Uses a lot of CPU for HDTV Video (no surprise I suppose) so not really useable on my Lenovo x100e Netbook, even the FM would stutter when opening or closing folder windows.  So far I haven't had much luck with it on my home desktop, what video I had was dark and unwatchable but I haven't had much time to troubleshoot.  Getting the newest drivers from the mfg website was difficult.",3,1
There aren't cut outs for the volume or power buttons.,3,2
Firstly it did not come with a anti glare screen guard as advertised and not iGet(TM) but bluecostco but other wise the case is pretty nice. Nook color fits well. Nice magnetic closing snap.,3,1
they look ok... they dont stick too well. the color red looks like its missing in some places... but what do you want for $10..,3,2
"I bought this to use with my Android phone and ended up using an old iPod instead. It will work occasionally with Android, but overall has a lot of issues connecting to Blue Tooth, dialing numbers etc. Using the newest firmware, it still has lot of problems controlling an HTC Sensation. After repeated reboots, constant re-paring of BT and failures to dial, I just gave up and hooked up an iPod for music. It would probably be best to just use the headphone jack output on your phone if you only have Android. USB sticks works fine and of course the Apple products work flawlessly. Damn you Apple, I hate having to give you props.",3,1
Pratical product.     Sometimes the Iphone says its not compatible with the charger. But it works fine.,3,2
"I totally agree with those who gave a 3 star rate. The software reminds me of the nineties. Having been reading ebooks in palms, smartphones and ppc's to read from this Sony 600 reader is a complete regression. Along with the software, the glare in the screen is a constant annoyance. Having to constantly move the book to find the right position to be able to read. It´s been more than a month and I'm still complaining,  it means that it really sucks.",3,2
"I was looking for a no frills MP3 player with an easy-access jack on the front plate to plug my Ipod into.  This was a great deal at 6ave Electronics, 30% less than Best Buy!  The sound is excellent, but the controls are a bit awkward and you can't see the button functions at night (kind of hard to read in the daytime too), but I'll memorize them soon enough. If you like to save gas by crankin' up the bass this unit has a separate subwoofer jack and two bass boost settings.  Rock on!",3,1
Well it's good other than the battery doesn't keep a charge. But as good picture if it had a longer charge it would be better.,3,1
"Meh, it was ok.  I didn't set the bar very high for this speaker & it was pretty much what I was expecting.  The bass is sort of there, but won't kill you with it.  I didn't expect much, so this was fine.  However, I was disappointed with the volume.  When you go to the max, there was noticeable distortion & scratchiness.  There are other, better, options available in this price class.",3,2
"Used for almost three weeks. Over all was a great product and I would say five stars save the fact the watch would not recognize the HR ANT unit. I tried moving the battery, cleaning battery and even buy a new battery. All to no avail as the HR just would not work. As I bought this primarily for HR zone training I had to return. I plan to buy the Ambit2 which is bit more then this watch but my gut is the HR will work on it.",3,2
"My ears are better than yours.  I guarantee it.  I'll bottom line it: for $40, this unit is a good choice.  However, for $70, you can find a much more impressive unit.  Look for something with a passive radiator, or two.  Search Amazon for &#34;CredDeal Angle&#34; (aluminum chassis alone is worth the price of admission) which has AptX, or &#34;Philips SB5200B/37.&#34;  Let's face it, you're all about that bass.",3,1
I got this due to the fact I though a sleeve would be snug fitting. This is not snug fitting at all. I found this by searching sleeve soney psr-505. It does not fit this model right. The light is great and my daughter loves the braclet she collects them.,3,1
Good price but a bit awkward. Had trouble getting it to stay put. Not made for hanging handbags. The top hook broke easily.,3,2
I like d the price of the MP3 player plus the fact that it had a mic to record voice.  I don;t like the fact that you can't move forward or backward within a MP3 thats playing only to the next or previous song.  But it serves it purpose but is very basic,3,2

"I just purchased this tracking bracelet. It has potential,  i understand when a new product comes out there will be kinks to work out and bugs to fix...<br />On a physical end it looks great. Slim, sporty and streamlined.  The colors are awesome and it is well made. The comfort aspect is really nice as well, you don't notice it much after its on. Good thing<br />that being said.  The app for this is ridiculous.  Actually it's unfair to use that word.  It would be an insult to the word. The glitches are numerous.  It's not that it doesn't work as much as there are tons of little issues that pester you just enough to leave you annoyed and frustrated,  personally i think that is worse.<br />The biggest problem that has me pulling my hair out while bordering on anger......If you are going to make and sell an item, especially stateside. MAKE SURE YOU ACTUALLY PROPERLY TRANSLATE THE INSTRUCTIONS TO ENGLISH!!!! While your at it, how about giving actual instructions.  The mess of the instructions are so poor you have to stop and wing it on your own.  I can't make sense of haphazardly strung together mess of random words. It is really that bad and that's coming from someone who is multilingual.<br />I have no idea how to work this thing so pretty much it's no more than a step counter.  There are no instructions on how to change any of the info. Stuff like time, it's set to a 24hr clock, how to change and a cess the sleep mode, calories and everything else.<br />It is frustrating and patience testing.  Customer service?  Ha, funny.<br />Like i said,  i get its a newer item and there will be issues, but this is a bit much. It has so much potential to be an awesome products that could very well make it in the upper to mid range fitness trackers.

The radio gets bad reception.I haven't connected the satellite radio yet . When I got the astrium it said it was satellite ready but they did not say that you need a tuner which is sold separately. I had to order the tuner and bring it to the guy who installed the receiver.When I got the tuner it was supposed to have the GPS antenna in it but it was missing and nobody will send the an antenna unless you return the hole item.  The GPS says it gives street names but all it says is turn at the next street and the names are in text on the receiver.,3,2
"product came in a few days so the wait wasnt long. Packaging was secure and included everything you need to get started. The band itself on the watch is really cheap and it feels cheap as well, but what can you expect for 23 bucks. But so far everything is working as advertised and video is pretty decent. This one actually records sound which i didnt know so thats added bonus. Three stars",3,1
OK but nothing special<br />quality is ok not more than that<br />a bit too big for 6&#34; kindle,3,2
"This product is bulky and does no great job at holding your phone in place. I recommend it only if you have a big phone like the Droid X, only because it fits better not because its actually works well. Small phones like the LG Ally look stupid and really don't sit well. I gave it a three because it does what it says, holds your phone in place but it doesn't do it well. For one the screws get funny after a while and you always have to re-tighten them to keep it from moving. I still use cause frankly i don't want to pay $[...] bucks for a real Verizon/AT&T car phone holder.",3,1
"I bought this for my grand son and he really likes it.  Like all Apple products, it is way over priced, but kids want it and it works OK.  I would not spend the money for myself, but do it for my grand children and they use it a lot.",3,1
I didn't get the first one that the company sent me but they did send me another one after I sent in a notice to tell them that I dont get the product. after a couple of emails back and forth they did send me a refund and sent me another one for my troubles. Also i have a Fourth Gen IPod Touch and it does work for that but for my Ipad it will not charge at all. It will detect it but never charge it. I had to buy an actual IPad charger.,3,2
"Both speakers arrived broken inside an undamnaged shipping box.  I suspect these are returns or seconds being resold with little concern about quality.  Full, immediate, refund kept me happy though.",3,1
"I wouldn't buy this product. I'm perfectly fine with it because I don't care much for overall cover (I have a case over it). The only \\""problem\\"" I'm sure people have with the cover is the piece for the back of the iPod. It doesn't cover the whole back, there's a bit around the edges not covered.

Im accident prone so I like keeping the otter box on, but when its off and I have this thing plugged in, it does work well and the remote is handy.",3,1

"This charger may work but mine failed, I think I know why. I plugged my 60 Watt cell phone in and it started to charge then stopped working. It's not robust but if you only use it for less than the 75 Watt rating and always with the vehicle running (to get 13.8 Volts in) it should suffice. I examined the circuit and the transformer burned up trying to charge with probably less than 12 Volts on a weak battery! I got a full refund for the product and shipping.",3,2
"The idea of this is great. However, it is extremely small even for my daughter who has very tiny wrists. It cuts off the circulation to her hands if she bends her wrist for any length of time. We also ordered navy and received royal blue.",3,2

"I have had this camera for a couple of weeks now, I purchased it just to play around with while on duty. I have not had any real issues with it. If your looking for a camera just to prove an insurance claim, well this is the camera for you. It is not for a professional driver or emergency service. This camera has a fish eye lens, that means the view you get is kinda panoramic. When you are 15 feet away from something it looks as if your 30 feet away in the camera, \\""Objects in camera are closer than they appear.\\"" The \\""I.R\\"" camera on the front are just L.E.D lights and if you use them they just light up your windshield and you can't see anything. The quality at night is useless, imagine walking through the woods at night with a cheap flashlight. That's about all you can see at night with this camera. I paid $25 for mine and $17 for a class4 32G card. The front lens can be adjusted up and down and that part has allot of play in it. The image quality is that of a cheap cell phone or a camera that comes on your kids spy chopper or Barbie doll. It's not enough quality to tell who someone is on a traffic stop but enough to tell sex,race,weight and height. Now with all that said it's fun to play with and for 25 dollars what do expect? It's not a camcorder, that's why you pay $300.00 when you buy one. This camera is for fun or to prove who is at fault during an accident. It will not help you solve a crime, well maybe just depends if the suspect happens to do the crime on the bumper of your car.",3,1
"The reason why I purchased this DashCam was because I read it has a higher bit rate than dash cams with similar features. Although, I was a bit thrown off once I realized I had to put 2 high speed memory cards; one for front and one for rear. So when I had to retrieve the footage I would have to take out both the memory cards and use a computer or memory card reader. Having a higher bit rate camera was a feature I was willing to for go in exchange for convenience. The camera is big and bulky and obviously noticeable from outside the vehicle because of the large lens.<br /><br />If your looking for something with good recording angle with higher bit rate, and don't mind the bulky-ness, then this Dash Cam will work for you!",3,1

"I purchased the Hyundai cable for use in a 2009 Hyundai Santa Fe, it worked great for about 2 years, then it quit charging the battery and it drains the battery very quickly when used, I still can control all functions of the ipod except podcast selection, which I have to start before I plug it in.

"Pros: Converts your ipod nano into a fun and fashionable watch.  It looks cool.   Cons: Not truly a watch.  Ipod nano battery life is shortened and also not waterproof.      The review is more so on the idea of the band.  The band itself is well-built and easy to wear.  However, it's all for show and not much else.  Ipod sits securely in the cradle and is easy to install/remove.   Plugging in your headphones isn't the best idea as the cord often gets in the way while your on the go.  Often times, you'll remove the ipod from the cradle leaving a dorky looking wristband.  All in all, this is a cool looking wrist strap but that's about it.",3,1
"Works fine but has a constant buzz sound even through D.I. Box, tried using signal filters as well no change.<br /> Reception good, It's good for non commercial environment.",3,1

Loved it love how I get to buy all in one bundle and I'm not spending an arm and a led I liked that the screen protector was very easy to put on with the step by step instructions,3,1
"Works fine and holds a maxi fuse well. However, the fuse holder utilizes a screw that pushes on the cable to hold the cables in place. The cables seemed slightly loose due to this clamping method and it didn't seem like it would make the best connection.",3,1
Here it is a some what of alright unit it has flaws but ok for the price maybe it can be updated,3,1

"This radio worked great in some areas, but not where I needed it.  I was trying to use it inside at work and I just didn't get good enough reception for my taste.  It was easy to use and it would have been great at home or most other places, but just didn't work well for me at work.",3,1
"The good: I love the color and the fact that the iphone remains pretty slim with the case on.   The bad: a little hard to put on without lifting away the screen protector, and most importantly after ~3 weeks the paint starts to disapear on both parts, revealing white plastic, not very nice...     A reminder that you only get what you pay for :)",3,1
This kit works excellent except for 12volt USB plug in... worked for about 30 minutes and quit.  All else is good so far.,3,1
Does its job but breaks easily.  Came nicely packaged.  The wall charger charges any usb. lasted a swell time.  No buttons on te outside to remove like iphone ones. so you just gotta pull it out,3,1

It works alright. Just leaks more than expeceted.,3,1
"Absolutely love the way it looks and feels in your hands... sound quality is solid especially for price...<br /><br />Giving three stars because right out of the box it just plays with tons of static, and the only way to get it to play without the static is by hitting it quite hard....

I don't profess to be a chemist or scientist but a cursory comparison of this battery when compared to the original BF888S battery I only find a difference in the battery label. This says 2800mAh and the original says 1500mAh. Supposedly they are both Lithium batteries. They otherwise appear to be identical. I weighed them both. The original comes in at 51 grams and this Aweek replacement comes in at 50 grams. Very strange. Beam me up Scotty!,3,1
Its a good amp when I first hooked it up but then it just stoped working I guss I call after the holidays tto see what can be dun its worth the money still,3,1
"I purchased a vehicle with this already installed in it, and I must say it is not the head unit I would have chosen. The touch screen forces me to poke endlessly about an inch from the actual button image, and sometimes it acts as if it is a larger screen while watching movies. It is difficult to use the touchscreen to surf burned mp3 CDs, but I have been told by Pioneer that if I want to drive about 45 min from where I live I can pay a service tech to re-calibrate the screen. I am very reluctant to do this, in that I really do not enjoy the touchscreen. I will say that it is a good head unit in its sound quality. If you can pick this up for under 200, it's not that bad.",3,2
"For the most part I am pleased with this purchase. The wired sound quality is really good for the price. True story - I had it set up and playing from an Android phone in the living room. While I was out of the room, my wife needed to turn down the volume for a phone call. She went to the stereo system and was dumbfounded it was off. She seriously did not realize the sound was coming from this little device.<br /><br />I rated it just so-so however because there are random glitches in the playback from a memory card. Trying several different cards made no difference.",3,1

"I'm currently pursuing my private pilot's license, and I purchased this kneeboard to help keep me organized while at the controls.  It's great for holding my notepad, a pencil, and my E6B.  The VFR clipboard contains a tremendous amount of information, and the text is printed directly on the board, not on a sticker like is seen in some other kneeboards.<br /><br />My one complaint is that it's too short to hold a regularly-folded sectional.  If you look closely at the map in the images, you'll notice that it's folded at the top and bottom, showing a nonstandard-sized section.  It's not a tremendously big deal, however I might have considered other kneeboards before this.<br /><br />Overall, I would consider this kneeboard for a pilot looking for a simple way to keep organized in the cockpit, while keeping in mind that sectionals may need to be refolded to fit for cross-country flights.",3,1

The little screws have to be removed to clean the suction apparatus and then replaced.  I kept loosing the screws in the unit.  The sprayer only squirts a small amount of cleaner at a time.  Needless to say, fair product but I am sure there are better.  I'm hoping target will take it back.  I got it for Christmas and my sister can't find the receipt!",3,2

"This is one of a group of no-name MP3+MP4 (video) players that share similar appearance and software. They come from somewhere in the Chinese electronics underground. They bury decent technology beneath user interfaces that range from \\""OK but duct-taped-together\\"" to awful. They're definitely tempting values: This one plays music, photos, and videos off a 2 GB flash drive, while costing less than many 1 GB audio-only players. <br /> <br />This one's interface is OK/usable -- unlike the UI on its hopeless \\""Kaser/YoFun\\"" cousin which I bought before it. This one uses decently (but not entirely) consistent key assignments. Its skip-track keys are placed nicely far away from its volume keys (but are not recessed, so you might press them accidentally). The volume keys face in intuitive directions, but it's too easy for your thumb to accidentally press the voice-recorder button opposite them. <br /> <br />It has a shuffle-folder play mode, but it's not properly pseudo-random: you sometimes get adjacent repeats. The lags between tracks are tolerable. Lags while navigating the folder tree, or between displayed photos, are annoyingly long. Most of the display uses an amateurish Courier font, because they forgot to build in anything more attractive. <br /> <br />MP3 sound quality, radio tuning and sound quality, and voice-recording quality are all good. It's at least backed by a real vendor, with a real e-mail address and U.S. phone number.  <br /> <br />Its main flaw is that it has a square (rather than rectangular) screen -- and it distorts photos and videos anamorphically (rather than cropping or letterboxing them) to fit them onto it. Not sure if a future firmware upgrade might fix this. Also, it has dual headphone jacks (nice) but no audio line-in jacks. <br /> <br />As an alternative, Creative's Zen Nano and Muvo MP3 players are simple and very usable. They work wonderfully, until a few weeks after their warranties expire -- at which point they crumble.",3,1
Not very bright doesn't show up unless it is dark out.,3,2
This product worked the same as the factory antenna. I have a Y connection and hooked both this and the factory up at the same time to check hoping it would improve reception but it didn't. The only advantage is this one I can hide in the dash.,3,2

"Purchased this case for my new Canon SX260.  I emailed the company to ask how to order the case in red but when my order came it was blue--ok, so I now have a blue bag rather than red.  I can live with that.  After using the bag a few times, I was unhappy with the snug fit.  I needed a bag that would allow easier removal for quick shots.  The top of the bag narrows slightly which I don't really care for.  I will keep the bag because that is easier to do then mess around with returning it but am now in the market for a better fitting bag.",3,1
"Wasn't what I thought.  First, if you are ordering the purple, all references will state (9 colors available) unlike ordering black which will reference BLACK. Second, the black cloth case (mivizu) is not shipped, some piece of knitted sock is substitiuted (false advertising).  The screen cover is impossible to do with out bubbles.  The Nike pouch is not an armband for the ipod to use while running: instead it is to tie into your tennis shoes to hold your house key and the penny you have left over after buying this misleading @#&*.",3,2
"!IMPORTANT! Screen protector: In this kit the \\""screen protector\\"" included is a piece of high-quality clear plastic. You WILL need to use scissors or if you have one, a razor, to cut this. Make sure you measure the piece of plastic you will be cutting from the about 6\\"" by 4\\"" sheet is a little bigger than the Sansa screen so it will stay in nice and tight. Since the case is a nice quality silicone you can stretch it just enough to fit the screen protector you just cut in. The outside of your screen protector will collect some dust but protects the screen nicely from scratches. A little tip I learned for applying the screen protector would be to apply it in a steamy room such as your bathroom after you take a hot shower. This prevents any dust from collecting on both the screen protector and mp3 player.    Armband and Belt clip: Using the belt clip will require some assembly. Please note that you will have to attach the belt clip accessory BEFORE you put the actual Sansa player in the silicone case. If you are going to solely use the armband it will slide through the appropriate spacing on the back of the silicone case with or without the belt clip piece being in place.    The case: Sleek, and snug BUT will attract dust and or hair, and you will have to sort of have to thumb the casing aside to turn the Sansa on and off. Also make sure you push the headphone jack all the way in, and you may or may not have some difficulty removing the charger.    Feel free to send me a message if you have any questions.",3,1
Bought this here and basically it was a great deal.. Regular stores would be double prize and i payed half so im happy,3,1
Sloppy construction causes the stations to “crackle” with the car is in motion. (I tested this while the car was off and tapping the antenna) Cheep double-sided tape.,3,2
"It works, but I am reluctant to use it because it extends the distance that the iPhone sits above the charging plate making it even more precarious.  Not only is thus 'tippy' but you also feel that a small bump can bend the prongs.",3,1
The speakers require a substantial amount of audio to trigger the spouting water effect. I listen to soft music and was hoping to have this available. It would be nice to have a swith to allow low and high audio response.,3,1
"I enjoy being able to listen to my music while driving in vehicles that don't have an Auxilary plug in. The down side to this FM Transmitter is that the signal is not especially strong. Finding a clear enough frequency is difficult, for the preset finding buttons just change the frequency by .2 each change, which can take some time to get to a clear frequency. However, I didn't have any issues with the order of which was set to what frequency as I had read in other reviews. It didn't seem to matter if the transmitter was turned to frequency first or the radio being used. Constantly competing with others around me for a frequency, possibly because of where I live, in MT, many use the same frequency for there are only a few that actually work. Plus, when there are XM or Sirius users nearby, I hear what they are listening to regardless of what I do, seperate from changing the frequency. XM and Sirius give off a much stronger signal, nothing against this FM transmitter.",3,2
This was my second GT680W.  The first one I received had the GPS but didn't work.  This replacement unit I ordered did not have the GPS.  It did not work as well as the first unit.  Night video had lines running up and down the video.  The daytime video wasn't as good as the previous GPS model.  The window mount tightening nut would cross thread if you tried to tighten it up snug.  I think if they did a little upgrade on that and the consistency in their cameras they would be a top notch dash cam.,3,2
"Although thus far it works ok and I'm not going to return this dock station, I also would note recommend it to others.  It'll serve its purpose until it dies.",3,2
"As others have stated, the actual iPhone connector is shoddy.  You can literally rip the hooks that clip into the phone, or the casing becomes loose and crumbles in your hand.  Even knowing this and being careful, it still came loose.  I fixed it by putting some electrical tape, cut to precision and then rubbing a lighter flame over the tape to seal the edges and it's ok now.  -2 stars for being cheap.  The USB works just fine as expected and the cable has good length.",3,1

"The case is very pretty and would protect the iTouch, if it doesn't have a screen protector. When trying to put this case on, it would tear the screen protector off from the sides. The color is also like a very pale blue, making it a bit difficult to see the design after slipping the case on.",3,2
The Case was too big And my little sister didn't like how it fit on her iPod. Very loose from the lock,3,2
The cable works fine but the length of the cord is very short which makes it difficult to use easily,3,1
These LEDs are very bright. The only problem I have had was out of the ten there were two that didn't work. One came broken and the other flickers on and off when hot. They do get abnormally warm for some reason. I not sure why.,3,2
"The sound quality is, as mentioned, very crisp.  You'll find very little bass in this product.  There is no adjustable sound on the device and even with my computer's volume up on high the sound hardly carries across the room.  The product is also battery operated and goes through a AA battery about once a week.  Otherwise, the product is small enough to carry in your pocket and is easily portable.",3,1
"I was excited to get a Bluetooth speaker for my shower.  However, after using this I will continue to look.  Most of this review is due to user error, but still errors like this are avoidable.  First off the speaker does not have a skip button, but it does have a plus sign that is used to skip to the next song, but also for volume.  To turn the volume up you have to hold the plus sign.  Listening to iHeart Radio you only get a certain number of skips, these were used within the first time pressing the button to try and turn the volume up.<br />  Secondly, the charge does not last long.  I used it once a day each morning and turned it on before the shower and off right after the shower.  It was dead within a week.  Then comes the second user error.  I have two other items in my house that use similar chargers, and have never lost them.  I misplaced the cord within the first week of using this speaker and since it is specifically for this speaker I could not use an alternate charger from my collection.  I refuse to buy a new charger, I will just look for a better speaker option.<br /><br />On a positive note, the volume level and sound that came from the speaker were just was I was looking for.<br /><br />This one is up to you, just wanted to put my experience out there.",3,2
"I order this case for my son ipod for Christmas, when I received it in the mail , and tried it on it wouldn't fit.. and he wanted the case so bad cause he loooove John Cena so much that I had to super glue it on for him..and find out they sent me a case for an iphone 4... instead of a case for an ipod 4 touch smh bad business",3,2

purchased this for my Magellan Roadmate. It is a little to big for the screen but you can't put the cord in the case b/c the plug is to big to fit. I use it just for the screen and it does its job. Just don't purchase it if you think it will hold the GPS and cord.,3,1
"This was ok. And just ok. I bought this and I probably wont use it. I bought this because my sansa needed protection. This does an ok job but it doesnt cover the screen. Sure it comes with one of those little plastic sticker things to put over the screen, but if I wanted to cover my mp3 player with a sticker I would have gone with a less expensive one. Read what comes with these skin kits carefully. Find one that has an actual cover because the sansa screen is easily marred.",3,1
"I got the case, but it took at least 3 weeks to arrive, and the holes dont match the camera, and the buttons dont match the power and the volumes, but over all it is pretty good for protection just the minor things",3,1
"This is the 2nd one of these that I bought.  I loved the first one, but when my mom got a Kindle and hated her cover, I gave her mine and ordered myself a new one.  This one is nice but they seem to have forgotten the magnets in the closure or put in wimpy ones.  The first one I could flip them around and they helped hold it open but with this one they barely seem to keep it closed.",3,1
"good thing about it is its clear case and it looks good. bad thing is, it comes right off when dropped.and the buttons designed on the case doesnt match on the zune.so i would say get another cover.",3,1
"The company that sold the case is very close to where I live so the delivery time was very short. The photos of the item were very generic and confusing; the company sent a letter in the package requesting that I not provide feedback if I wasn't going to give them five stars (whoops). The case overall does what it's designed to do, it protects the IPOD. Due to the thickness of the side area it's a little hard to work the perimeter of the touch. I suppose it could be made thinner but the quality of the case would probably suffer. I would buy from the supplier again, but only after clarifying what I'm getting through an email or phone call.",3,1
"Got this as a prize at a technical conference. It made my 5yr old and 2yr old smile and giggle to watch it. So that's worth something. My 8yr old and 12yr old were just slightly amuzed for a bit and then they tired of it.<br /><br />The big problem is it doesn't have rhythm. It comes with 3 dancing styles, which all involve the upper body. The legs bend a little but stay put and don't go up and down. One of the styles has the cat quickly bending side-to-side. One shows kind of an S curve as he bends and goes up and down a little. The other is a more muted arm and shoulder wiggle. It switches between these styles and sometimes does them in reverse. But the movement does not seem to be synchronized with the beat of the music and that's what really disappoints. It tries. It does seem to read the tempo and slows or speeds up the movement, but the up/down and side-to-side doesn't match the beat. If they had designed the software embedded on the chip to read the audio wave form, decipher beat, and give the poor little thing a sense of rhythm, I think it would be a fantastic toy for young and old...but it doesn't.<br /><br />Tech specs: Needs 3 AA batteries. I don't know how long they last in it because 10 minutes is as long as my kids stayed amuzed as we tried out a variety of songs. It does not come with an AC adapter. It does come with the 3.5mm audio patch cable to connect your music player with the hole on the left ankle. If you don't want to burn through batteries, it requires a 5-volt adapter (good luck finding that one) that puts out at least 1000mA, which plugs into the back of the left ankle. For both power sources, wait until the music is playing and then turn on the switch, which is unfortunately located under a velcro cover on the back instead of being easily accessible on the foot where the other gear plugs in. If you're tired of the dancing or want to give the little servos a rest, just squeeze the left paw and the dancing stops, becoming a cute, furry speaker.",3,1

I was super surprized when I received my package. The first reason was because I received the package a day after it was shipped. I was amazed that I got the shipment a whole six days before I expected. The second reason I was surprised was because of the quality of the product. Maybe it my need for perfection but the stitching of the pouch was way off. If the pouch is only  three centimeter why would you sew for four? The size of the pouch may have played a factor in the construction but the velcro  and the logo shouldn't have been displayed crocked. The sides of the top and button shoe lace loops are slightly loose and not even the same length but all the minor mistakes can be overpasses due the color and the somewhat slim body on the pouch and the easy to open slit for the sensor. The product is great if they gave it their minimum effort but if these was their best effort they need to considered mayor solutions to fix the present issues.,3,1
"Not what I wanted, I wanted  a 30 pin to a lighting end on docking station.  Didn't,t know how to describe it.",3,2
for the money i would get a obd2 bliuetooth to hook up to phone and get touchscan or torque app works better but this was just a basic toy for car,3,2
"Fits perfect but the color doesn't last long.  The color automatically starts to wear off, all the color is gone from the sides, but is still a good buy for the price.",3,1
"The case looks awesome.  The only issue is that it doesn't work very well if you have a screen protector on your iPod.  I have a mirror screen protector, and when you put the case on the iPod, it pushes the corners of the screen protector inward so it looks like there are giant air bubbles at all of the corners.",3,1
I bought one and for myself and like it. but my husbands did not fit very well especially when working out. didn't really expand,3,1
It's okay.,3,1
Navigation system could not locate a road though map quest could. A major road in a small town!,3,2
I think the speaker is pretty cool and the color was red but it turned out to be pink. I thought it was supposed to be portable but it wasn't which sucks i should have read more of the description. The speakers got bass and good sound quality was great but a month later it started sounding weird when it was on full volume and it made a screeching sound when it all the way up. Which is weird? But other than that it was good for the size of it.<br /><br />I would recommend this to people who want a not big but small speaker but to sound like those larger speakers.,3,2
"I purchased this for use on film sets with the CP200 Motorola Walkie. It fits snugly as I would want it to. I use it on a utility belt, and it does tend to 'hang off', it does not hold it tight to your body. A smaller walkie talkie likely would fit better.",3,1
It's alright it don't look all that HD to me. I have also had some files come up with errors and it seems to always be the parts I want to see over. I don't know if I would get this I would pay a bit more and get something that is real HD. The files for me are not 150mb per 5 min but more like 540mb and that was only set on 720p without audio set on. It also has a cheap feel to it like it can brake on me at anytime. Not to happy with it right now but for 50 dollars I will just hold on to it. I would not buy this over tho.,3,2
"The case is not the same as the image. The spaces where you can put SD cards were missing. I bought one of them black and the other one brown. The black one came with a pen holder, but not the brown one. It's strange 2 identical products of the same manufacturer come with different resources.<br /><br />Good things: well done, resistant material, beautiful and the cover puts Kobo to hibernate automatically when closed. I recommend despite the manufacturing problems.",3,1
Went perfect with my aftermarket stereo but have had problems keepin the kit flush with the dash it keeps wanting to pop out I had to put a gripper around it to stay tight but other than that it fits,3,1
works well. nice features with GPS. Mic too sensative for racibg though. my gopro is a better choice for how loud the race car is.,3,1
It is pretty and made well but it doesn't let me access the buttons on the side very well. The nook slides down and the buttons get covered up.,3,2
"UPDATE: I am downgrading my initial 5-star review of the 0801. After about 8 months of use it began to shut off all by itself while it was recording. Unplugging and plugging back in brought it back to life, but only for a limited time. It seemed to be worse on hot days. Eventually the problem became terminal and I put it out of its misery.   I purchased a replacement 0801 about 7 months ago and now it is having problems of a different nature. The movies recorded by the device have artifacts in them. I am now experimenting with less stressful recording settings to see if the problem goes away.  Although the 0801 did not come with Mac OS X player software, there is a 3rd party solution called Dashcam Viewer which allows you to play the movies while watching your vehicle move on a Google Map. Works on Mac OS X and Windows. It can be downloaded from DashcamViewer.com",3,2
"the product as itself works precise, but there this noise all the time, so to minimize it yoy have to move the device from one side to another, the charger is nice but it gets way to hot.",3,1
"these are okay but they are stretched out on the sides and fall off sides easily ,need to have a tighter fit to them.",3,1
"Product came quickly mounted easly in my helment .<br />Plenty of cord lenght.Volume control works well Not as loud as I expected ,but it could be my radio",3,1
Its a great cover I just cant get it to stand up but its a good deal if yoy need a quick cheap cover and I got it in about 3 days,3,1
"This cover was as advertised, but I found it to be too skimpy to be effective. It had so little coverage on the front of the ipod, because the ipod screen is so big, that it kept coming off. As soon as I was able, I bought a hard case and that is working much better.",3,1
The mount was not complet.but I am satisfied with my purchase,3,1
The sunshade fits okay.  However it arrived with one finger broken.  It still fits on my gps however and because of the low price i decided not to make an issue of it.  Arrived when promised.,3,1
"This was not what I expected to get. Before you buy, you should know that the lace and pearls aren't really there they are printed along with the mint color onto a clear case and the mint doesn't wrap all around the case. The color is just on the back, not the sides of the case. It is really pretty, but as I said, I expected the lace and pearls to be on the case, and was therefore slightly dissapointed.",3,2
"yes this Golla bag its beautiful, candy for the eyes, is different and it's pretty colors catches every att, however when it comes to protecting my cell it's a different story.  Beautiful shell but no padding, it's like keeping your phone in a regular plastic bag with a hook.  It's not a protective case it's just a carrying bag.  It's hook is pretty nice to keep cell phone hanging from your belt hook and a zipper for change and credit cards but again it's to simple with no protection from for my phone if it's droped, it differs from the leather cases that actually have some nice padding inside.",3,1
"I bought this a year or so ago and (unfortunately) didn't get the extended warranty this time. After many hours of downloads, at least 100 CD's, it stopped working. I took it apart and found the tape that holds the hard drive to the battery had come apart in several connections. I called all over, searched the internet, and found someone in Canada who had the same prob w/a similar model. He knew of 2 other people as well.<br /><br />I (finally) located RCA-Lyra Customer Service and was told after about 20 min on hold to give them my credit card number and they'd bill me $100 then tell me where to send the unit for \\""repair\\""<br /><br />I know they're going to just send me another of the same product and I'm going to lose my hours of downloaded music. The buttons DO stick, it takes forever to format the music (it reformats everything in the memory, instead of just the CD or file you added).<br /><br />I am not happy with this item. So now do I pay the $100 and get a new one or just say screw it and buy an iPod?",3,2
"I ordered an 8&#34;  case, but received a 5&#34;. This is too small for my tablet. Where do I go from here?",3,1
It was a little difficult to get the two plastic pieces to snap together over the rubber. It felt like the little connectors might break while putting it on the ipod. I wouldn't suggest getting this if you think you might be taking it in and out of the case often.,3,2
"This item is 8\\"" in diameter, so quite large and I've seen some smaller ones so that is the main thing I'm not crazy about.  It's called \\""bean bag\\"" but it's stiff and not pliable yet it doesn't slip off the dash even with this size because of a non-skid bottom.  The little clamp on my Garmin GPS that is pushed to clamp it to the windshield works when you push it to clamp on the hard plastic center of this device.",3,1
"The case is snug and the color I wanted. However, it leaves bubbles on the screen which is a bit annoying. But overall, it protects my iPod, which is what I really wanted.",3,1
not worth the time,3,2
"Ok, cheap is the word of the moment.  I have a six year old.  Nintendo DS Lite $150 + $40 a game.  For under 90 bucks. You can get this and leave it as it arrives in the box, which makes it an ok web browser, but mostly its a book store.  The better option, (for us anyway,) is to use the free firmware update from Pandigital to bring in Android apps.    Now my six year old gets to learns on a device with an interface she is gonna encounter for years to come on phones and who knows what.  It is not a total bullet in the wallet if she does break it.  Youtube did not work out of the box.  Some other flash seemed to work.  The firmware update to get the Android app store will not launch on XP SP3.  The Pandigital_Novel.Upgrader.exeS spits out an error message which I tried to troubleshot for 3 hours on 2 XP machines and one XP virtual machine under kubuntu. I'm fairly certain this is .net failure, but on Microsoft's end or on Pandigital's I can't tell.   Finally, I borrowed a Windows 7 laptop, (installed .net 4,) and the update runs.  It tires to auto detect model and serial number, fails, but allows you to type one in, (model or serial number).  In XP it just crashes when it fails to find the numbers.  Someplace the firmware file itself is out there, without the need for the installer, but I couldn't find an ftp.  Got the firmware installed.  Still no youtube.  Went to app marketplace in browser, and I can't install adobe flash player 11.  My phone is not detected.    That's my out of the box and 6 hours later experience.  I'm pretty sure I can get it to upgrade like I want it should play flash, and get me into the app store, plenty of nice games for a 6yr old, if I can get in.  but I am not there yet.  So hard to configure, no external display, does have a memory slot. It has a usb port, not sure if that can be a usb host.  But cheap, cheap cheap.  Did I say cheap?  Maybe inexpensive is more PC.",3,2
It was protective but after a while it started to stretch out and didn't fit my phone that much.,3,2
"Item came, although some of the white dots are slightly faded away before I even opened up the package for use.",3,2
"First, I love the structure of the case and the protection it gives.  The simple design is what makes the case.    The bad.  It looks like it's black in the pics, but it's brown, and there is only brown.  I've had the case for about 2 weeks and the front cover fabric is getting loose by the binding.  I can press it over the loose area and the fabric will stick back down, but will loosen up again.  I think it's cause I use folded open a lot, but that's natural with this type of \\""folio\\"" case.  It's just by the binding bottom to top.    Final word; great case, I don't mind that it's brown. Just wished the build quality was a little better for the price and name.  Otherwise solid.    P.s. The whole folio has a cool retro feel",3,1
My iPod touch isn't getting scratched up as much but it looks a little dirty even though I clean it every time I listen to music on it which is like every other day.,3,1
"These covers aid in the function of IR transmitters used in entertainment center remotes. For that purpose they work properly. They are not quite what I wanted, however, since the ones I had were soft rubber and these are hard, inflexible plastic. That limits the use  of these covers to flat surfaces, often not the type of surface presented. I have been unable to find the soft rubber covers online.<br /><br />Coolmaker",3,2
As advertised.,3,1
Nice,3,1
"This cable came in okay packaging, software disc was in good shape and cable looks good. I started on installing the software it came with. Pretty painless, everything installed well when following the directions. So I went to set up the cable itself, they don't tell you that it is a fake ftdi chip in it. It was workable after several hours of searching the internet. I got the drivers installed and works flawlessly. I went ahead and made a DIY to make the cable working on e90post. Sach my username and find it: Peepyopi or just follow this link.  http://www.e90post.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1116419",3,1
not very loud but worked fairly decently. just very minimal volume unfortunately,3,2
Lowered to three stars because one of the 3' cables is coming apart at the connector after only a month and a half of very light use. The other two cables are still OK. Trying to figure out how to contact the seller to resolve the issue.,3,2
"The screws to hold the speaker at an angle stripped out and won't hold the speaker now.  They will work for me with my setup.  The sound quality is about what you would expect for the price.  So, they are ok.",3,1
It did NOT come with an LCD protector film! Otherwise I would have given it a 5 star.,3,1
"Like the units,programing came with them.Nice because of squelch control,around electrical devices like computers and phone systems a plus no annoying sounds..",3,2
"nicer looking than the other car cams, and seems to be well built. BUT - no way to mount and remount into another car. Only way to mount is using double sided mounting tape which makes a permanent mount in 1 car. A strange design - the base of the camera doesnt detach easily from the camera, and the power cord plugs into the base - NOT the camera itself.<br /><br />SO, if you pull the camera off the base to try to use in another car, there is no more power cord... it's attached to the base which is permanently taped to your windshield.....  ( Yes there is an internal battery, but it wont last too long )",3,2
"Not bad for the price. The switch on mine for the left arrow is hard to activate. You have to hit it just right. Sound is decent with good quality headphones.Trying to see if you can stop at one song and have it turn back on to that song. Right now, I have to scroll through all of the songs I've already listened to.",3,1
"this is a good buy, but with the gel cover on the nook, it made the leather case very tight! also the top strap gos over the volumn buttons, im always having to turn it back up! its annoying!",3,1
"There isn't much to this type of cover, but this manages not to seem overly cheap (unlike some I have seen sold elsewhere). Does what you expect and gives a me a nice feeling of having a little extra protection if I ever drop my beloved Clip+.",3,1
I wish the clamping mech. would have been made heaver. I do not like the way it clamps the phone,3,1
"Good Product and attended my expectations<br />The wrist band could be in other colors like black, grey or other.<br />But this fitted on my wrist and was delivered on time.<br />Thanks<br />Decio",3,1
Product is great for charging  Your devices And it has been a good player up until 3 months ago. I've had it for a year and it recently stopped getting a good connection. It's something with the cord that plugs into your device. It's loose and plays only through one speaker now and vaguely through the other. Also the quality of sound is dependent upon your radio stations reception and alot of time is spent trying to find a clear radio station when that time should be focused in the road.  I would just recomend paying the money to have a stereo with an ac jack.,3,2
"I ordered this as a gift for a friend at work. There was no charging cable included, and the phone had a loud static when trying to emply the car speakers. I had great success with a similar product for my HTC Hero, but as I could not reach the company to send me the charging cable, I must give this an unfavorable rating.",3,1
"This a good purchase, except beware if you have a cover on your IPod.  You'll have to take the cover off to use the cradle.  This can be tedious, taking it on and off just to use the cradle.",3,1
"This unit looks and functions well for the most part. However, it comes with no support and mine had a damaged ipod cable which is very unique and impossible to replace. The front usb port on mine also doesn't work. I have messaged the seller/manufacturer (Square S) 4 times on multiple platforms over the past 2 months and have received no reply. I even told them that they didn't need to replace it and I just needed to know where to get a new cable. They claim to offer support but will not. Be aware that if you get a damaged unit (which seems very likely) they will not help you. Its not worth the trouble or price.",3,2
"For the price it is not a bad product, specially for a first timer system.<br />fairly easy set-up(you tube if you need assistance).<br />there are three products in this purchase<br />the cables which are fairly cheap and i recommend buying a higher quality set(usually 15-$20) to replace them.<br />the 10&#34; sub hits decently enough but don't expect to get the really low end deep growl  frequencies tho.<br />the amp. well the amp is my only real gripe about this setup .when i first installed it, the amp and every thing worked fine..for the first three kicks then it died on me. after replacing the dead amp the sub works great.<br />please keep in mind this is far from a competition type of setup so don't expect to disturb the neighbors with it.<br />the reason for the 3 stars is due to the amp nearly instantly dying on me and having to upgrade to better cables (I highly recommend that you do).<br />the old adage  of &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; rings true with this set.",3,1
Easily falls off ipod,3,2
needs more power,3,1
I bought these for my husband to put on his car I am not fond of skulls but he likes them,3,1
This is the second iBRIGHT miWood ipod docking station that I've purchased.  The first one shorted out after 1 week and the second one after two months. The reason I am still giving this 3 stars is because the company I purchased these from responded very promptly with no hassles when I asked to return the first one and with the second one they got back to me quickly when I requested a refund.  The customer service has been great.  I was also told that the power cord was the problem and that they would ship me out a new one.  The product itself is actually very stylish and sounds good as well so I hope the new power cord works.,3,1
cable pulled out of the end of the antenna and i had to take it apart and recrimp it. item is made cheap. the item does work well for what it is.,3,2
"the cord is exactly as described. the length is fantastic and all. the only real problem that i had was that the end that plugs into the iphone 5 is actually just a bit snug when plugging into the phone. you actually kind of have to force it in. i didn't think it would be an issue, cause once you plug it in, it works fine. however, when taking it out of the phone, i tugged and the cord actually broke. thankfully, the company sent me a brand new one, no questions asked. still, the second cord is still snug. another thing, every once in a while, the phone will be charging, and then i'll receive a message saying \\""charging not supported by this device\\"". if you unplug the cord and replug it, then it continues to charge. i don't know why this message occurs, but i do get it. i could be slightly crazy, but i do think this cord/charger doesn't charge as quickly as original apple cord that comes with the phone. it does feel like this cord does seem to take a while to charge. i don't know.<br /><br />in summary, as long as you don't tug super hard on the cord and maybe not use it as your main phone charger (being that it seems to take a while longer to charge. is that bad for the battery, i don't know), this charger is worth having the extra length to work with. it's not the super greatest charger, but with care, it works for charging. :)",3,1
I bought the item to use as a iPod holder. I was very disappointed when it arrived. I did order the small however a child cannot even use it for the intended function. The phubby could either hold an item or fit on a very small child wrist.,3,2
"I ordered this item mainly due to the positive reviews but unfortunately, my reception is lukewarm.  Luckily, I didn't spend a lot of money on it and the screen protector seems to be of high quality.  For those of you who are getting bubbles, here are a few tips:  Start by matching up the edges to the bottom of the iTouch, then SLOWLY roll it down whilst, pushing the air bubbles out with a flat item e.g. flat side of a credit card...that should keep it mostly bubble free.  There might still be a few smaller bubbles. Again, try to push them out with a credit card or piece of smooth thick cardboard but if they remain, they \\""should\\"" disappear in ~ 24 hrs on their own. During that time, do NOT turn the iTouch on as the heat will make it sticky...just let it rest, turned OFF for a day or so.<br /><br />As for the skin, I am disappointed by the fit.  It is just a touch too \\""loose\\"". I think the problem is that to save cost, they left a huge opening for the bottom of the iTouch (where USB port + headphone port goes) so it kinda \\""hangs\\"" loosely ~ loose T-shirt...I keep finding myself squeezing the sides in to try to make it shrink which of course it won't ! In all likelihood, I will end up purchasing a better skin as I am anal-retentive.  I wonder if it is meant for the 2G version? Is that one thinner? Although they do mention for both 2G/3G and they made the impressions for the new volume controls.  It's apparent though that think they didn't custom-fit it though to the 3G model.",3,2
I have gone thru a lot of windshield holders for phones/GPS and this was not what I expected. I am rough with my things and this product I had to be careful when I connected my phone.,3,1
"I needed something that could transmit about 50 feet through a couple of walls and thought this would be perfect. These did not work for me. They would not connect at that distance. As for sound quality, i'm sure it was great but could not really test.<br /><br />The units I received also did not come with power supplies even though the instructions say they are included.<br /><br />The last issue I had is that these units (both TX and RX) have to be powered on by holding the power button for 3 seconds everytime power is pulled and applied. I wanted these to be  wireless solution with no interaction once setup but these would not work like that.<br /><br />I ended up returning these items.",3,2
"The EL wire is very cool.  lights up well (the green is brighter) and works as advertised.....  Except for the color.  It isn't read, it's more orange than red.  I bought it for a Christmas float to use the red and green together.  I powered it from my 12v cordless tool battery and ran it an hour.  I unplugged it from the battery, it didn't die in the hour.  No idea how long it'll run on the little battery, but I was impressed.  Would be 5 stars if it was red and as bright as the green.  Still nice, but the green is uber-cool.",3,1
"When I bought this it was $20 less than Amazon and now I Paid $10 more.    1.  The Quick Start Guide is totally inadequate.  2.  The online .pdf manual is inadequate.  3.  The buttons are hard to press.  4.  Many buttons have changing purposes, which are not clearly explained.  5.  The online videos are incomplete and too short.      I would not recommend this to a friend.",3,2
when I got this It was great I thought! then I put my ipod in the case and clipped it to my pants and was fine for a about a week then the belt clip decided to break so I still use it een though the belt clip broke I still have this item and I still use it it's a bummer that i have to take the case off everytime to charge up my ipod that I don't like but oh weells you pay for what ya get! otherwise great delievery will order again in the near future so thank you!,3,1
"This case was actually smaller than I thought it would be and my camera barely fit into it.  The front pocket was nice however for the memory card, however, I could not put batteries into it when the camera was in the case.",3,2
"I was completely surprised to find that I could not connect my IPOD Touch through the USB port on my new CDE-125BT.  My old Alpine worked fine through its' USB port.  Why on earth did Alpine remove this functionality.  Apparently you have to purchase a special cable that plugs in the back.  Otherwise I like the player, although support for my old Alpine changer would have been nice.",3,1
"As stated it is for VW/Audi only. It will not work on American cars. I bought it to reset my ABS light on my 2008 Jetta as all repairs have been made to the system. The Code Reader did show a code for the rear wheel which did need a slight adjustment. However, it will not reset the ABS light it shows a &#34;Linking Error&#34; which from the forums I've visited its a sorry about your luck issue. Also, there was no CD in the package. This product is OK for picking up a code but not clearing it.",3,2
"The materials feel cheap but it looks decent enough. When I first received this case, the \\""felt\\"" on the inside had a VERY bad smell but after a few months the smell faded so it wasn't noticeable. It holds the reader firmly in place but the bottom right elastic strap covers half of the power button and makes it difficult to turn on and off. My biggest complaint is that the spine area is very flimsy so when I go to close the cover, the magnetic snaps don't line up so I end up leaving it unsnapped all the time. If I were to buy another cover I would pay the extra money and get a nicer one.",3,2
"This item was okay, but you needed two people to open it at first, but then it got more easy. I ended up using silicone case because i was worried it might get stuck",3,1
product is okay. probably should show the correct pictures instead of showing two different cases. i had to wait almost two weeks just to get my case when i was told it would be delivered in 3-5 business days. in all honesty im really not pleased with this purchase at all. or the seller by far.,3,1
Works ok I still lose reception though,3,1
"I installed the mount on my mountain bike and attached my small fixed focus digital camera to it. I took it for a ride on a flat single track trail (L.B. Houston - Dallas, TX) and all was fine.<br /><br />I went for a second ride on trail with more climbs and drops. It was a trail that is at a moderate technical level (Arbor Hills, Plano, TX). Again, my camera is pretty small, but I'm guessing the weight of the camera stressed the plastic, and the part that wraps around the handle bar cracked.<br /><br />I'm giving it three stars because of the price and that it works well for the road and flat trails, but I think the product should have held up better. If the description states that is not recommended for off road use, then I missed that. And I did not crash, fall, or hit anything during the ride.<br /><br />I am thinking of buying another one to just use on my road bike, and then upgrade to higher quality mount for the trails.<br /><br />I know GoPro and others make cameras and mounts designed specifically for off road use, but that's a whole different level of expense.",3,1
"Pretty cheap,  works but low quality",3,1
"Before I get into my complaint, let me say that I really DO like this Garmin product! The 760 does as good as it's maps allow it to do. I love the MP3 player. The screen is plenty big, good color and very readable in sunlight. I've had mine several years and it still holds a good battery charge. I love adding my own POI and routes and I love that it's compatible to MapQuest so I can create a route on MapQuest and download it to my GPS. The Bluetooth works well and I've always had fun downloading voices and vehicles (my son even created his own voice for us to use). I like the \\""Where Am I\\"" feature where I just tap the vehicle and it gives me info to what address I'm near, my coordinates and nearest emergency locations. Garmin also makes it easy to keep your GPS updated. As far as I'm concerned, Garmin beats TomTom and Motorola by a long shot (no, I haven't owned either of them but I've talked to people who have).<br /><br />My gripes? Well, the suction cup doesn't last long, but thankfully there's a dash-mount replacement that works beautifully ([[ASIN:B002OL2MU4 Garmin Portable Friction Mount - Frustration Free Packaging]]). The biggest problem I have with this particular model is that it wants to take me on highways. Even though I have it set on \\""fastest route\\"" it will take me 10 minutes out of the way on a 20 minute drive to take me by the highway instead of taking backroads (my drive to my friend's house is 20 minutes by backroads and 30 minutes if I follow my Garmin 760). If I turn onto a side road, my 760 will do everything in it's power to convince me to turn down other roads just to get me back onto the silly highway. I've checked other settings and there's nothing in there I can change to make it do otherwise. The only setting that is close is to tell it to avoid highways. I don't want to avoid them! I just want the fastest route! Other than that, the 760 is a great little GPS.",3,1
"This product works just fine.  The only thing is that I keep having to press the button on the top everytime I start my car to get it to transmit.  In additional to that, the only other issue is that I could not get the remote to work with my ipod touch, which was not a big deal to me.",3,2
"Clear, fairly easy to install.  However, makes the Garmin touch surface considerably less responsive to pressure--it takes longer to input commands and data.  You may have to press harder, or press a couple of times for certain letters.<br /><br />On the other hand, it will protect against scratches.  You can't have everything.  At least the film is pretty cheap.",3,1

Thought I was being generous and getting her the better speaker, but instead she hardly uses it because it is so persnickity when trying to link via Bluetooth.  My Angle just pops on instantly, no problem, but the Oontz requires a precise series of button-pushes and link orders.<br /><br />Apart from this the Oontz is just great.  Solidly built, full sound, a quality piece.  But I would recommend the no-drama Angle, instead.",3,2
"I have other MP3 players but none with an FM tuner. My requirements were simple; has FM tuner and uses alkaline batterier (I hate the rechargeables!). My only complaint is the earbud jack doesn't make a good, full, consistent contact. It cuts out occasionally so I have to mess around with the jack to get it working again. They are the same buds I use with my other player with no issues so I know it's this player. Not worth the hassle to return/replace it.",3,1
"I purchased (2) visors for our 5\\"" Garmin GPS units. I have to admit that the concept is good but that you could certainly live without it. The overall effectiveness is minimal (should come out further) and the visor does cover part of the sides of the screen. Once mounted, I found that it is very difficult to reach the power button (upper left corner) without removing the visor each time. It may look cool, but I wouldn't recommend it.",3,1
"The clear case is fine, snaps on and off easily.  However, like MANY others I've ordered, the chargers DO NOT WORK with Ipods/Iphones.  However since they were 'free' with the case, no biggie.",3,1
"This unit works great in that it does what it is supposed to do.  However the side grips do not hold at all and because of that you have to tip the unit back so your ipod doesn't fall off.  Also the plug in jack that came with the unit did not last at all,  it broke at connection within a couple of weeks.  I do like that you can turn it off and on and a remote is nice but in my truck not needed because it is all ready at my fingertips.",3,1
While the product lived up to expectations the device/batteries have both failed within the first 30 days. One battery will no longer take a charge while the second tends to turn itself on at random. I will attempt the warranty exchange program in the hope of continued use of this great idea of a product.,3,2

"I purchased the CaseCrown memory foam case for my TomTom XXL540TM hoping that I could fit the car charger in with it but no such luck! Also, the adapter plate that holds the TomTom to it's mount must be removed or you will find yourself pulling and yanking and deforming the shape of the case to get it zipped shut.  Beyond that, it's top notch for construction and feel of quality. The memory foam is a nice feature for protecting the TomTom screen from damage and since I only need this case for the GPS device itself anyways, it serves it's purpose with style.",3,1
"This product is described accurately, and it arrived quickly.  Fitment is perfect and it actually would appear to be the original charger that came with my iphone.  The only complaint is that it takes forever to charge the phone.  I'm not sure if this is a low power charger or what, but it takes longer to charge with this charger than even my car charger.  If time is not a concern, like you charge over night, then for the money this can't be beat, but if you charge on the go during the day, prepare for several hours for a full charge.",3,1
"The top of the case has a small crack.  Sometimes dust and little bits of things get stuck underneath the case and have to occasionally be cleaned out, but it has done its job in covering up the back of my ipod so far.<br />Also, although there is a hole for the back strap, the case is a little too thick to actually use the strap the ipod came with.",3,1
This worked well for me as I drove across the country but it does have some static issues that can really drive you crazy.,3,1
Price is right and it controls iPhones and iPods well.  Plus the sound quality is pretty good.,3,1
"I bought this for an instrument that is really not supported anymore by current software. This is out of date, and I purchased it with the full knowledge of that. It breathed newer life into my dated GPS. But the end is near...",3,2
Excellent and amazing product I recommended for every one because its a very interesting and useful product so buy it now!,3,1
"i have the same gripes about this cheap monitor as the other reviewers, it was just thrown into a box with no padding, and no manual, not even a scrap of paper to confirm the dip switch settings.  and yes the white tab was for the screen protector, which is applied obviously before they put the monitor in the plastic case as the edges are under the plastic.  I guess my biggest complaint would be that the monitor will in fact go to a blue screen if signal is lost, it will show some snow with a weak signal and it does switch back pretty quickly when signal comes back.",3,2
"Not happy with performance, but i gifted this device to my frnd other wise i will return this phone.So sad with performance.",3,2
I bought two of these thinking they would work with my Ipod shuffle 3rd generation but they do not work at all. I don't know if they work on a 2g or not. Construction quality seems better than the other ones I've seen but I can't say how well it works on a 2G. Looks like I am going to have to dish out the $20 for the apple cable.,3,2
"Like the different feats to play music, including usb.  I gave it only 3, as other reviews have stated the vol. quality is not so great; nonetheless,its worth the price.  Its light, and convenient placing of buttons. When using usb, there's a button for you to search for albums.  It would be awesome if that feat was more advance, by including a search dial to conveniently search through album (in which currently can only be viewed auditorily, they are not labeled) and then search for song w/n the album.  For now, you will have to search for album, and then use frwd/ bckwrd button to find songs individually.  Enjoy!",3,1
This is nice for my kitchen TV. I don't like that I have to turn it on each time. It's like a guessing game to turn it on.,3,1
These will protect your kindle fire but try as I may cannot get it rid of all the bubbles and I cleaned it first like it said-don't think there is any thing else out there that serves the protection purpose.,3,2
not sure how well it will hold up once installed.,3,1
This unit does not come with any instructions. So if you are savvy on this kind of product you will be in trouble.,3,2
"I've owned this system for a month and already the color display has stopped functioning. Feels very cheaply made. After calling Scytek and experiencing their horrible support, I will never (nor shall I recommend)  their products again.",3,2

Pros:<br />It works<br />It is loud<br />It sounds decent for everything but music<br /><br />Cons:<br />It does not play your ring tone at loud volume (what I wanted most out of it).  Instead you get a voice reading you the digits of the phone number calling you.  Not even a synthesized caller ID name just the digits.<br />It turns the bluetooth off when you plug it in to the included USB cable under the assumption that you are also going to plug in the headphone cable.,3,1
Did not work as expected. Must be charged to operate.,3,2
"No need to spend this amount of money for a CPL filter. The Lukas cams use a 37mm lens filter, which you can buy in any decent camera store or right here on Amazon. They run between 7 and 12 dollars for UV and polarizing filters.",3,2
"Pros <br />Overall, I'm happy with it-- I've had it for several months. The sound is fantastic-- better than the two other MP3s we have in the family. The earbuds that come with it are superb. It allows up to 192 kbps in MP3 or WMA and sounds great at that level. It's got a lot of nice features on the menu such as a sleep timer which I use at night, several sound settings like Rock, classical... that actually makes a difference in the sound. The radio is fun, but I rarely use it. <br /> <br />Cons <br />Biggest con for me is that it will freeze your computer if you try to use it with Real Player. Also, the battery life is terrible. Seems like every time I use it the level goes down a fourth. Part of the problem is that the screen stays lit even when it's supposed to be dim. I use it as a flashlight sometimes when I don't want to wake anyone by turning on the lights. The scroll feature is cool, but I hate it that the play button is part of the scroll. Are you pushing the play button or scrolling? You can't tell unless you look at it because it all feels the same. When you are scrolling, you accidentally hit play. Also, right now if you try to use it with the new Windows Media Player (11) it will crash your computer. Their website says they are working on updating the firmware. Transferring playlists is impossible unless you select automatic synching which puts everything in your library over to the player whether you want it to or not. At least I haven't figured it out yet. <br /> <br />I know there are a lot of cons, but I do like it in general and use it a lot more than I thought I would. It sounds fantastic and I haven't had many technical issues with it so far.  <br /> <br />",3,1
"Unlike the photos in the ad show, the mount holds the Nexus 7 only along long side.  This is most likely because the new Nexus 7 (2013) is slightly more narrow than its predecessor.  But it holds OK, although just barely, since it must be tightened to its smallest setting.  Although it is designed to be used as a windshield mount, I preferred to use it with a weighted dash base mount that I also purchased at Amazon (Arkon CM012 Friction Dash Mount).  If you are going to use a weighted dash mount be sure that the mounting area for the suction mount is at least 91 cm (3.6 in) in diameter. If you moisten the suction cup before attaching I guarantee it will not come loose!  The mount allows the tablet to be easily oriented in either landscape or portrait orientation.",3,1
"Did not work well when used in my car; poor quality of music, contained static. However, it did function much better in my 1998 Mazda pickup.",3,2
"I listen to music and it's nice. It has a clear sound, along with the speaker. One of my pet peeves is whenever I'm listening to a song, or switch to lock to unlock I'll hear a loud static and the mp3 will freeze and then I'll have to reset. Additionally there are moments were the player will freeze out of nowhere and of course I have to reset the player.",3,2
"I purchased this case because the flip-out stand seemed really cool.  But in reality, I've had it since Christmas and I've never used it to stand up.  The stand keeps it from  laying flat on the table and sometimes it's slightly cumbersome to hold.  Other than that the stand is fine.  If you will use the case to stand your ipod up, then I would recommend it.",3,1
It does play music and is easy to set up.  Buttons dont work as they are said to on directions. I still can't figure out how to shut it off completely or answer the phone on it.,3,2
Did not work as expected.,3,2
This arm band is comfortable to wear while running. One issue is the band can loosen up after a few uses and must be tightened. Second issue is the material becomes rather smelly from perspiration. The band has to be washed frequently.,3,1
works just as described and easy to set up.<br /><br />BUT the range is nowhere near oem...sometimes it seems you have to be right next to the car for it to work,3,1
this product is ok. the stand did not last long. It broke about a month after buying.,3,2
This sticker doesn't stay on the nook very well after some use. Wish I would have bought an actual cover,3,1
my boyfriend and I both bought one.. its an okay case.. but if try to take it off too many times IT WILL BREAK!!! kind of disopointing.. but if its still as cheap as it was 2 years.. i'd say worth the money as a tempory case!,3,2
"I so looked forward to this coming, however it worked fine at my son's house.  They use it all the time.  At my house I can't even get the local stations.  Don't know why.  So, it sits unused until I can find the time to check out the problem.  Doesn't seem to be anything wrong with it maybe just my area is bad.  Very bummed.",3,2
Worked with one Sony tv but couldn't get it to pair with the Phillips tv.,3,2
"There is a lot to like about this case. It let's you protect the entire product without worrying about anything getting to the screen and scratching it. It's very lightweight, which is a plus for when you are trying to carry it in a purse or bag. However, it's not the most attractive product and whatever it is made of SMELLS. The smell unfortunately transfers over to the nook.",3,2
"The unit is quite small and as a result, sound quality suffers.  It is too bad that there is not a high quality compact CD and Cassette Player available for those of us who occasionally want to listen to a quality cassette",3,1
"This product was under ipod touch, when it's really for a phone. There's an opening for the camera. It's also very hard to get apart, and I can't use my ipod in the docking station with the cover on.",3,2
"This works ok, however it is still a pain to plug into the phone due to the clearances on the case. I bought it for my wife luckily, so at least i do not have to deal with it every day. The seller did an excellent job with packaging and shipping.",3,1
"First of all this was my first MP3 player that I've ever had, and let me tell you that I LOVED IT!!!  The product by itself is very, very nice.  The glossy look (more about it later) was a plus when I was looking for new MP3s.  I did a little online research before deciding to buy it, and I found out that there were no other players who were capable of surpassing the capabilities that this little devil had, not even the infamous iPod nano.  Well then I went to the store, bought it, charged it, and used it.  My first impression was that the product was great, it was small, looked better in person, and had a nice screen.  First of all the interface is pretty much a copycat of the iPod's interface in black and blue, then came the time of the truth to see if it sounded as well as it looked.  IT WAS AMAZING!!!  I had been warned beofre by a few friends who had MP3 players that the audio quality wasn't very good, but let me tell you that I didn't notice the difference with the original recording, and the noise reduction earphones were the best I had ever seen or heard before.  A few weeks passed and I was in paradise, however there were a few little things that frustrated my experience.  First of all the glossy surface was the best fingerprint magnet I have ever owned.  The problem is that you want your player to look nice the whole time, and you MUST whipe it clean with your sleeve or with some other fabric to keep it looking brand new (a plus for the iPod, and people with OCD).  Then the other problem was the processor.  The speed at which it worked sometimes made it CRASH on the middle of a song, it reminded me of a computer from the 90's trying to play a CD.  After playing with it for a while, I found the EQ settings on the menus.  The sound difference is remarkable compared to the EQless setting, however the speed at which the player worked after choosing an EQ setting almost made me want to throw it away.  For me it was absolutely ridiculous that I was running as fast as my grandma when the EQ was on, then (of couse) I turned it off, because I didn't want to waste $200.  Then the other problem was a \\""ghost\\"" on my player.  Somehow the touch sensitive buttons were too sensitive for the job.  I would put it in my shorts when I was running and swety, and it would FF, RW, pause, and change songs without me even touching it.  THAT REALLY SUCKED.  Also don't forget not touch it with a sweaty or wet hand, the sweat or water may be left behind and the player just goes crazy after that.  Well, a few months later and it started to get me annoyed.  It was crashing at least five times a day, then I called Phillps to tell them about my problem, and I got a replacement for that one.  It was as if I had the same player that I bought before, it even started to mess up at the same time as the one I previously had.  As a final thought, I would recommend this player for someone who doesn't have an active lifestyle (it skips from time to time if you shake it too much lol... all HDD players do), is an audophile, or is on a budget.",3,1
"It took almost two months to come after the week delay had ended. It took forever!!! It is watertight, though, and that is all that matters",3,1
"I just bought this, and I must say, for the money, it's an okay product. It's definitely not the same quality foot rest I have in my office (which is probably much more expensive), but it's not terrible either. When it is at its lowest setting, it's very sturdy, but when it's raised to its full height, it feels rather flimsy, like the plastic might break if you put much pressure on it. One other thing, and maybe it's just me, but I find the really strong smell of rubber from the tread to be rather gross. I haven't had a product with this problem before. It smells like bicycle tires. I hope that fades with time.",3,2

"Smartmini is a good choice if you need blue-tooth streaming and/or hands free calling. It won't be as convenient and feature rich as a car manufacturer installed system, but at $40 is a good and inexpensive option.<br />The good features:<br />1.Indeed the bluetooth paired up and works (with caveats) with my smart phones.<br />2.The FM transmitter does not affect the sound quality<br />There are a few immediate obvious drawbacks:<br />1. the 'neck' of the device is quite long and in some configurations will be to close to the stick shift.<br />2.the device tends to overheat quickly when using both the FM and the bluetooth transmiters, thought it does not affect its functionality. Also it is too easy to change the FM frequency by accidentaly touching the dial button on smart mini.<br />3.On most phones using bluetooth, even setting the phone and the smart mini volume to maximum, still does not sound as loud as the regular FM stations, so you'll have to adjust the volume every time you change the station.<br />There are a few less obvious flaws regarding compatibility:<br />4.When using a Nokia 710 phone with bluetooth, the streaming would not start every time when you hit the play button on smart mini.<br />5.When using HTC One S with bluetooth, streaming can not be controlled from any button on smart mini.<br /><br />For both phones the streaming can be controlled from the phone interface thought.",3,1

"I received these 6.5\\"" speakers but they are actually 5.25\\"" cones.  There is a spacer/adapter plate so you can mount these in a 6.5\\"" hole.  I feel pretty ripped off.  I haven't installed them yet so I don't know how they'll sound.  Just wanted folks to know this... BA labels these as 6.5\\"" speakers but in their dimensions, the drivers are only 5.25\\"".  So, it's not the seller's fault... but these really should be called 5.25\\"" speakers with 6.5\\"" mounting plates.<br /><br />EDIT: I decided to install these last night.. and it went pretty well except for the ins/outs of the crossover.  They are among the cheapest, smallest connectors I've seen for car audio.  They accept 16ga wire and the tiny set screws can be easily over-tightened.  These type of connectors would be fine for small home audio projects but I do not have faith they will hold up long term.  I expect to have to open my door panels in a few months because a wire will get loose.  The included hardware and connectors are all 'adequate' and nothing special.<br />Install note: The wiring diagram is on the bottom of the crossover housing and NOT in the paperwork...<br />The crossovers were very easy to fit into a space in the back of the door panel.  They're long and skinny, only 1 per door.. I found they fit behind the armrest indent quite nicely. (2005 RAV4)<br /><br />Sound quality is very acceptable in the end.  If the connectors were made for car audio applications and they were advertised as 5.25\\"" speakers with 6 and 6.5\\"" adapters, I would give these 4 or 5 stars.  They are quite nice sounding.  The mids are rich and full the highs are very detailed without being overly harsh or brittle.  These are replacing Infinty Reference components (actual 6.5\\"") and I can't hear and detriment to bass or mids.. The BA's are overall better than the Infinity's in SQ... just easier to listen to.. they are also a little more efficient.  When the first BA was installed, it was definitely a good bit louder than the Infinity.  The highs are remarkably better than the Infinity's just much more refined and realistic.  I'm using a JL Audio 6-channel amp 2 channels front, 2 back, and 1 bridged mono for the sub... I don't remember which model/power... but it's enough. :)<br /><br />In any case, if you're willing to be very careful and cut your speaker wires back to 16ga and figure out some way to get some strain relief to the crossovers (lots of electrical tape?) then these could be very nice speakers for the long haul... but for now, it's still 3 ***'s mainly because of their weak connections...The highs are remarkably better than the Infinity's just much more refined and realistic.

"I bought this item to hold my Sirius radio to my windshield.  My observations are as follows:<br /><br />-  Falls off occasionally.

However, you will need to clean the window and plastic suction cup again once it falls off.<br /><br />-  One of mine cracked.  Now when I stop short the flexi-stick slides out.  The one that cracked was in the car that I take the radio in and out the most.<br /><br />-  Really needs to be resting upon the dash to stick correctly.

"The AppRadio 3 is great in concept, but it is being held back by poor execution. The problems with the unit as of now are poor app selection, hidden costs of setup, and some minor design flaws.<br /><br />The app selection is terrible at this point. As an an Android user one of the more glaring omissions is the lack of support for Google Music. As of today, there is no way to listen to internet streamed podcasts via an app like Stitcher. I can start the app on my phone and let it play through the bluetooth connection, but I could do that via my car's aux jack before AppRadio.<br /><br />There are some hidden costs of setup as well. You are going to need a few cables depending on the type of phone you have, and the amount of supported phones is fairly small. I purchased the MHL connection kit [[ASIN:B007YCZT58 Pioneer Android CD-AH200C Connection Kit for AppRadioTM 2]], and discovered after I had everything installed that I still needed an extra adapter for the Galaxy S3.<br /><br />AppRadio has a few design flaws. With my Galaxy S3 I can either use AppRadio Mode or Mirrorlink. Neither of witch offers much more than a handful of useful apps. There is not a whole lot of documentation on why you should choose either mode. The limitations in place while your car is out of park are draconian. I understand the need for driver safety, but some of the restrictions are crippling.<br /><br />The product could be made more useful with a software update, but as it is now it is a really expensive tech demo.",3,2
"the skin get's the job done, however, they're a bit flimsy and come off easily; the price is right.",3,1
"I would like to start off by saying this is a low powered, single line surface transducer so you can't really expect it to be loud.  That said this is a great little portable speaker for those on the go.  Of course it'll be louder on somethings than it will on others.  Also the thickness/stiffness of the material will impact the sound as well.  A box, cylinder, or cone with one side (which you would fasten the Rock-it to) that's thin and not too stiff -- but not too flimsy either -- and open on the opposite side seems to work the best for me while the sound just gets trapped inside a hollow object with no open sides.<br /><br />Also applying some soapy water or Windex to the pad and then letting it dry revitalizes it so it sticks like (or maybe even better than) new.<br /><br />*update*<br />Well today (after quite a bit of listening to music from my phone through it at work and bringing it home to charge every night so lots of attachments and removals) my Rock-It no longer plays the crisp, clear music it used to (if it plays anything at all) it does a lot of buzzing and just sounding awful.  Loved it while it worked, but now not so much...",3,1
"These are ok. I am thinking about sending them back. The seal around the ear is not totally sufficient, these creates noise leaking into the headset. The noise cancelling function is pretty good, but can be better. The boom mike is also too short. It needs to be about 1/2 inch longer at least. I am going to try them out a couple more times to see if anythings changes.",3,2
"I ordered this for my son's iTouch and was happy with the purchase. We were looking for a case that was not as slick as the plastic cases because my son carries his iTouch in his pocket all the time and I feared it would fall out and he would lose it. The case fit his iTouch which after reading other reviews I was concerned that would be an issue, but not in our case. The case is coated with a rubbery texture but it is a very thin coating and is more for looks than for protection. This case is best at preventing scratches, I would try very hard not to drop it. My biggest complaint is how quickly the white case started looking dingy and couldn't be cleaned. I would recommend getting a dark color for these types of cases.",3,1
Works great. But if you plug the charger in it will not tape while charging. Great 1080 p very clear but I guess I got the bad one,3,1

"I see I wasn't the only one who had some shipping issues. It was only a DAY behind schedule for me so I should be thankful. Okay so the case is GREAT! Gives the nook hd+ a nice sophistication BUT I would say you would need small to medium sized hands to feel comfortable. Luckily for myself, mine are at the cusp. All nook hd+ owners MUST HAVE THE N2A CARDS to get full benefit and you practically turn your nook into a netbook! All in all I'd say in my case, literally, it was worth the wait cause there's NO WAY I'd pay full price!<br /><br />So here's an update. All in all, this keyboard is very annoying. I actually type faster on my friggin cell phone. You can't really use it as  a netbook because the keys are so sensitive. It really is disheartening bbbbecause it slows me down haaving to always backtrack. I was looking forward to writing but thats definitely not gonna happen. I will keep trying but so far i  really hate it.",3,1
"worked, but didnt do what i wanted it to, because I, < me > didnt think it through all the way. Its a wonderful mic none the less. Tho i was able to Rig something together so it did work..",3,2
I recommond do not buy this cause after I buying the case I found I did not really use it.,3,2
I've had one almost exactly like this before. This cable is my second one and the first one broke when I was taking it out of the deck. The blue side has a large hole in the back. I took some glue and poured a little bit down in it to strengthen things up.,3,1

"As a buyer of well-over 300 Baofeng radios (and counting) for the group I belong to (not all of which were purchased through Amazon but many were), I'm always amazed at the lengths some sellers go to to hype their products as being \\""newer\\"" or \\""better\\"" than other models, or perhaps (to give them the benefit of the doubt) they just don't know any better.<br /><br />First, the Baofeng UV-5R series (including the original and still extremely popular UV-5R, I'll explain why in a minute) is what is normally referred to by many as a SDR radio (or software defined radio).  While not a true SDR product (you can't use it with your computer to control the radio's functions or scan a wide amount of VHF/UHF frequencies with it), none the less a large chip is programmed on the circuit board built inside each radio.  That chip determines what capability the radio itself can perform.<br /><br />Every UV-5R series radio has the ability to transmit from 136-174 MHz on VHF and from 400-520 MHz on UHF in both narrow-band and wide-band modes (very useful for the occasional FRS or MURS use, which requires narrow-band mode to work correctly).<br /><br />Every model does \\""at least\\"" 4W on VHF/UHF from the factory, but occasionally you'll get a batch that does 4.5W or even 5W out, but the difference between 4W and 5W is minimal at best.  A 4W radio with a better antenna will easily outperform a 5W radio with the standard crappy antenna that Baofeng ships on ALL (including the UV-5RA, -5RAX, and -5RAX+) models.<br /><br />Baofeng DOES NOT program those chips any differently for the UV-5R vs. any other UV-5R series (including the UV-5RA).  Version 307 of the firmware (which is the most current release I have in any of my radios) works EXACTLY the same way as previous older releases of firmware at least back to the 295 release (over a year ago), so any claim from a seller that this release provides additional features (at least from a user's perspective) is simply BOGUS, since the firmware inside both radios have the same features.  In fact, my UV-5R radios with the 307 firmware release is EXACTLY the same radio (inside and within the firmware) as my UV-5RA radios with the 307 firmware release.<br /><br />Second, you CANNOT in any way upgrade the firmware (unless you count buying a different radio and it comes with a different firmware release), so again the claim in the listing from some sellers that you can is simply BOGUS.<br /><br />Third, you can believe that two thinner pieces (glued or screwed together on the faceplate of the UV-5RA) is somehow stronger than one thicker piece of plastic (on the original UV-5R series) if you like (and maybe it is), but I haven't seen that in real-world use from my own UV-5RA units.  The standard UV-5R units that we use seem to hold up just as well (when dropped in the desert dirt or rolling down a hill) as any other Baofeng radio we own and use.<br /><br />Fourth, and my biggest issue with all of the non-standard UV-5RA, UV-5RAX and UV-5RAX+ units, is that NONE of the Baofeng battery accessories (except the little 1800 mAh standard battery) work WITHOUT modification (unless you use a Dremel tool to grind or cut off part of your extended battery that works on the standard UV-5R - but won't work on your UV-5RA, UV-5RAX or UV-5RAX+).<br /><br />Getting new UV-5RA units that don't work with Extended 3800 mAh batteries (without modification) doesn't make my group happy.  That may not bother you, but NONE of the sellers of the non-standard UV-5RA, UV-5RAX, and UV-5RAX+ units ever seem to mention that lack of hardware compatibility in their listings, so buyer beware!<br /><br />BTW, NONE of the \\""AA\\"" or \\""AAA\\"" battery shell packs work on the UV-5RA, UV-5RAX, or UV-5RAX+ units either, so that's 3 different battery accessories (including the 3800 mAh extended battery) that you can't use on these radios without hacking them with a Dremel tool (but they all work without modification on the original UV-5R units).<br /><br />So \\""if\\"" you want a \\""pretty\\"" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (or -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.  Oh, you should see how well that shiny faceplate lights up when a flashlight hits it in the dark, just the thing you don't want for night use.<br /><br />Virtually every guy in our group ends up carrying a standard UV-5R and giving the UV-5RA, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ to the wife or kids, since the wife and/or kids rarely care about the other accessories working and they (the wife and kids) tend to like the \\""pretty\\"" radios, but again there is NO INTERNAL difference and NO EXTRA FEATURES in the UV-5RA, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ units (other than a different looking shiny faceplate) vs. the original and still wildly popular UV-5R (which I refer to as the M16 of radios, as all the accessories you match it up with just plain work).<br /><br />Now you know the real background on these radios.f\\"" you want a \\""pretty\\"" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (or -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.

"Nice little speaker with good sounds and battery life. Max volume level is good for a medium size room if you want to be able to hear someone else, but in general it leaves you wishing you could turn up the volume just a little more.",3,1
already had one blow in the first month of having them an I am only pushing a 400 watt amp to a pair of these so the sub shouldn't of started smoking when I am under pushing them other than that good subs just that one problem sorry,3,1
It was recommended to buy together with the headphone I was buying. I was on a buying spree so I got it as well. It turned out that the headphone package has all the necessary accessaries and this one is really not needed. Anything you find that you need after you get into the store is actually not needed at all. Forgot that rule when ordering.,3,1
Its very durable. the color is NOT like in the picture. It is a more darker boring purple. Also its hard to clip together and VERY hard to take off. I bought it for a friend but upon noticing all of this I kept it and bought her something else. I wouldn't recommend but it took care of my ipod when it has fallen multiple times.,3,2

"Watch out for the terrible design flaw- if your car is anything like mine where the outlet make it hard to bend down to see the screen, you'll spend some time guessing which station the FM transmitter is on, makes for a fun game of radio roulette.

"The appearance of the shipping container was a bit disturbing.  It appeared to have been dragged through some dirt as there was grit in various places on the bubble pack envelope.  Inside the keyboard was in a retail display box that was a bit bent up.  Fortunately, on first examination, it appeared not to have damaged the keyboard itself.  I guess if this keyboard had cost much more I would have been more upset but I decided to give it a try.  So far, I'm not impressed.  Pairing was simple, however it took multiple tries to get the keyboard to register the code numbers to join it.  It's not all that stable with the 2014 Galaxy Tab 10.1 in place and typing seems to take a bit of extra finger pressure to get the keys to respond.  The &#34;M&#34; key appears ready to pop off after using the keyboard only two times with very little typing.  Unfortunately I can't really recommend this keyboard to anyone who enjoys touch typing.  I will probably be looking for a better keyboard.",3,2
"It is a nice little speaker, works with pc or phone or other stereo jack/USB devices.  Stereo Jack is not robust.  used mine for a couple months and the jack broke loose from the board internally.  I always use with the speaker placed on a table or counter adjacent to the device (usually a phone with music on it) and no strain on the cable.<br />Overall a nice sound and volume output for the size of the speaker, and for my uses the battery life was a pleasant surprise.<br />Unfortunately the price seems to be getting jacked up, and with the limited durability, I will look for a new stereo jack solution.",3,1
The sound is good but unfortunately I bought Monster High headphones to use with it and there is not a plug in for headphones.,3,2
This is not an actual rubberized vinyl type case like you see on some phones. It is a regular plastic case that has a thin rubber type paint. The problem is this paint starts to chip in about a week. The solution however is pretty simple. All auto parts stores sell the same type of rubber spray paint so you can touch it up no problem. If I would have known this to begin with I would have just bought the paint and taped of my ipod and painted it instead. Since all ipods are anodized and anodizing is a type of oxidation they accept paints pretty well just buff them with a  2000 grit sandpaper and your good.,3,1
It's ok i guess for the money. Doesn't attatch well to the phone and if you drop the phone. Forget about it.,3,2

"For the price, I was expecting an excellent product.  It's...okay.  I have an ipod touch, and bought the Apple-branded screen protectors...now, granted it's a smaller screen on the ipod, but I have been pleased with the ipod's protector, so figured it would be good to similarly guard my Kindle Fire.  I ordered these...but I found the installation difficult (I still have bubbles) and find that the protector shows way more fingerprints than just the glass did.  I also have a Marware case for the Fire (which I like), and find the hand strap leaves its own marks on the screen protector.    I like the \\""velvety\\"" feel of the protector, and find my finger glides well.  I am not experiencing the distortion problem others have talked about.  I just wish it wasn't so bubbly (and I am well aware of the slow, repetitive, frustrating process that putting on screen protectors can be).  I'm trying to decide whether to remove #1 and try #2...or if I feel there won't be an appreciable difference in reduced bubbling around the edges especially, and the smearing/marking of the case (by the same company) are frustrating.    I guess for 15 bucks, I was hoping for more...",3,2
I had to use both antiglare shields to have it stay properly. When I repositioned the first shield it would not stick properly. The second one worked OK.,3,2
It did not work in my car! I used it 2 times and it killed my car both times. I have a 98 Ford Escort ZX2.,3,1
It worked like it was supposed to just installation was pretty difficult and that sometimes it's a pain in the but to keep the dirt n dust out from the inside of the case.,3,2
I have all my music stored on I tunes which by default is not stored in either format. I wished I had paid more attention to this detail because now I am faced with having to convert thousands of songs over to mp3.

"This is a nice piece of equipment, had it installed incl. steering wheel controls to hv hands-free phone and music in my car via my IPhone. Please consider that the bottom line cost after professional installation is not exactly cheap, but the unit seemed the best of the ones I looked at.  And if you plan on strictly running it via your IPhone, it is rather slow, little nice, but fine. Will probably have start using voice control / Sira as the one major problem with this unit are the apps supplied by Pioneer, which especially after the latest OS-upgrades are challenging, to call it mildly.",3,1
"UPDATE (2/15)<br />After using this on and off for a while, my conclusion is that this is more trouble than it is worth. The actual image and such are fine, but the control interface is so obtuse that it makes it a complete chore to operate. I almost expect to have an accident in my car because I was trying to get the accident camera to work.<br /><br />Anyway, for the cost when I bought it, it was fine and my previous review pretty much stands on many levels. However, unless the manufacturer has updated the interface software, this camera should be viewed as a temporary solution at best. On some levels, it is a good unit to \\""get your feet wet\\"" with dash cams. The problem is that when you need it to operate quickly, there are too many chances you will be fumbling through the menus to get the thing to operate.<br /><br />Again though, the video quality is fine. It is the control issue that makes this unit obnoxious to operate.<br /><br />*********<br />I won't go into all sorts of detail as other have done already. I bought this unit as it was a good price and I wanted to test the waters. For the cost, it is a great deal and it seems better than another similar unit on Amazon that is a few dollars less. The menus are a bit confusing and the mount likes to be on glass as opposed to the dash vinyl, but for the price it works fine.<br /><br />Get the 16gb card as opposed to a larger card as noted by another user. Apparently this unit has an upper limit with recording and the 16gb works fine.<br /><br />Overall, a good starter dash cam. If you want more features, there are plenty of pricier options. However, this one is easy on the wallet and gives you the feel for dealing with dash cams.",3,1
I needed it to study for a test.  The recording quality is horrible but it worked. Don't buy one like it.,3,2
"While this is a cheap product the quality definitely shows it. It fits on my Zune well but it is very thin rubber and I do not see how it can protect anything. This is a great way to change the color of your zune but nothing more. The buttons are a little tougher to use, rather than just simply touching them you have to apply quite a bit of pressure. It is just okay. I should have spent a few more dollars and got a better case.",3,2
Works fine.  Absolutely no directions included.  Would be difficult for a novice to install.  Relatively good product for the money.,3,1
An okay transmitter for an okay price. It has a cheap build to it. The sound is weak and lacks bass when using the transmitter. Get what you paid for.,3,2
"It was delivered fast and in pretty good condition. The screen was a little scratched but not enough to matter. It didn't come with any directions so I'm not sure what exactly all the buttons do (the important ones are easy to figure out), or how to change the temperature to F instead of C lol The transmitter has a usb port on it, but it seems to be just for charging (unless I just have my dock settings wrong on my phone). Over all I'd say this is a great product at an awesome price.",3,1
"for my son's nook touch... the only reason it got an ok is that the latch doesnt stay shut so it is hard for him to carry.  If he drops it, the rushing wind as it falls causes it to flip open and it has landed face down a few times, right on the screen, even though he had it &#34;clasped&#34; close.  fix the latch and it would be perfect.  The graphic was perfect, good color, look and feel.",3,2
Wished it would have held up a little better.,3,1
"Marginal sound quality, poor LED screen. Meets my needs barely. Even speakers this size could have more bass. Why do all good sounding sets have to be monsters?",3,2
"The directions for the kit were clear, but the assembly was very difficult.  The board and components barely fit inside the case and I had to try about five times before I could get it to snap together.",3,2
This is a nice product which includes all you need by way of cables and adapters.  It is spoilt by not having enough range to cross a room.  I suppose this is not surprising in such a small neat package with physically not enough space to provide a large enough antenna.  However this can be overcome by using a piece of wire about 20 inches long and wrapping about two turns around the body of the unit and leaving the rest to dangle.  This rather destroys the idea of a neat package but it works to substantially increase range.,3,2
"It is hard to program the alarm.  Generally, not the most user friendly.  It doesn't allow for automatic setting of alarm on a weekday basis.  But the radio works well so I'm using it in the bathroom as clock and radio.",3,1

"The clock functions well and syncs with the iPad  easily, however, the model seems to have some conflicts with items such as the iPod Nano, and older iPods.<br /><br />As an alarm clock, this works extremely well, with several sound settings, including using your iPod as an alarm clock, but it's a feature that only comes with some cravats. if you want to use your own playlists, you must create a special playlist, and assign songs to it, instead of having the clock radio be able to choose your own, already created playlists.<br /><br />As an FM and AM radio it is functional and works.",3,1
"I received this cover only this morning and was trilled when I first opened the package. The cover was very nice and sharp looking, and I loved the texture and color.

The appearance of this player is just average and the buttons setup isn't that cool or great.Plus it used microsofts software to play the files and its not supposed to feel like a pc where it takes a lot of time to make playlists.also the battery life isnt that good. i give it a 3 because its one of the only full out media players.But they only offer  20 gb models which is a bad thing.Archos has a 20 gig and 80 gig model but highly discounted on buy.com . Also the archos av420 can record your tv shows in composite or in s video hopefully component in the future.it can play mp3s for 12 hours before needing a recharge which is better then the creative zen as far as I know. it plays many video formats and offers 16:9 for videos.the screen is pretty darn big  and the buttons are easy to get used to. and it uses its own os which is upgraded with fixes and features often. The archosav420 and 480 are highly recommended. I recommend putting the built in speakers volume all the way up and the bass in the middle.movies can be a lil hard to hear sometimes but u should use the headphones all the time. i give the archos a 5 cuz there is never any problems with it and the zen a 3.5.,3,1
"I love this case, i received what i expected.. But after a few times of taking it off to clean my screen or so, the plastic part of the case had seperated. I may order again because i feel it was my fault. But, it was an excellence case.",3,1

"I have a 3rd-generation Kindle, which, as Amazon is fond of saying, has a 21% smaller body. Since Amazon put a big tag on the item that says \\""Compatible with Amazon Kindle (Latest and 2nd Generations)\\"" I figured it would be a good fit. I didn't think the smaller size would make a big difference in the fit of this cover, but it does. It's a LOT bigger than my Kindle, which gets swallowed by the cover. It's not even visible in the notch in the top. I wish they had a smaller version, since otherwise it's not bad, but I ended up sending it back. The other thing that I wasn't happy about is the inside lining. It's \\""plush\\"" in about the same sense that a naked mole-rat is plush. I expected a soft, fuzzy, teddy-bear-like lining that wouldn't make me afraid I would scratch the screen every time I slid my Kindle in and out, but I got something more like suede. It's probably ok, but it still made me nervous.    I think I would recommend this for Kindle 2 but not for Kindle 3.",3,2

Still, for the money it works well enough to be worth the purchase.",3,1

"As many other reviewers have pointed out, the main seller of these iPod Nanos on Amazon is advertising new (&#34;non-retail package&#34;) units but is actually shipping old, refurbished units with expired warranties. I would recommend spending those few extra $s and buying an iPod Nano from Apple. That being said, my three-star review is directed firmly at Apple and the 7th gen Nano itself...<br /><br />Firstly, this is truly (as Jony Ive would no doubt tell you) a wonderful, magical device and a miracle of modern engineering. The 7th gen's internal amp is a slight step up from that of the 6th gen Nano with a cleaner sound and marginally quieter noise floor, although I still prefer the size (and clip) of the 6th gen model. Here's why the 7th gen Nano only gets three stars from me. For a dedicated DAP that does basically nothing but play music and has no internet-connection capabilities of any kind, 16 Gb storage is pathetic and paltry. (Technically, it can play video too, but with the tiny screen and tiny amount of storage, I'm not sure why Apple even bothered with this capability.) After waiting three years for a refresh of this product, what do we get? Improved internals? More storage? At least the OPTION to pay lots of extra $$$$s for more storage? Nope. We get new colors. That's right -the opportunity to buy the exact same thing, but in a slightly different color.  Come on Apple. Get your act together.",3,1
"OK, now... If I was just reviewing my RED case that I have on my ipod, I would give it 5 stars.  I love it.  It looks cool.  In fact, it looks better than what is pictured... because it is completely different.  The top and bottom don't come over the face nearly as much. (No useless ear hole up top.)  There are some that look like the picture, and some that look similar to the picture with the bottom that comes over the home button with an open \\""O\\"" instead of the \\""U\\"" shown.  My problem is, I didn't get what I ordered.  The colors were all there, but the STYLES were different as well.  Be aware of that.  They were cheap though.  The red case fits like a glove and looks cool, only problem is that it does not have the sound holes in the back... like some of the other colors had.  ? {Shrug} ?",3,1
They arrived on time and look great. I just ordered the wrong generation.,3,1
"This screen goes on well with minimal effort. Bubbles are easy to smooth out for a great fit. However, in certain lighting the screen is hard to look at because a rainbow effect covers most of the screen, obstructing visibility pretty badly. Several of my friends have this screen and absolutey love it. I personally prefer an antiglare protector such as the elago or the screen protectors currently sold at AT&T.",3,1
Doesn't hold the Ipod in very well.,3,1
"I installed these in my GTI, and they can't be heard. My component speakers put out more bass then subwoofers 4x less then the cost of these!!! Even the worn out stock VW 2 ohm speakers in the front that aren't blown seem to put out louder bass. I have owned loud kickers before, what happend? I have owned subwoofers that have cost half as much and done a better job. My advice, buy some 6x9 boxes and some Pioneer 6x9 full range speakers, they will pound harder for 40$ a pair UNAMPLIFIED (unlike the subs). I still haven't found a speaker to put out more bass then my pioneers other then 10 and 12 inch subs... which is too much of a trunk hog for me.",3,1

"I just discovered this while discovering a few similar devices that actually do support stereo audio over BT now exist (at the time of writing, still for 3x the price).  However, purchasers may be interested to know that \\""BTmono\\"" apps exist to push music out the mono speakerphone Bluetooth profile on Android devices.  I've never tried such myself (my current solution for ghetto cordless in-car mono music is a Jupiter Jack I got practically free), but this is exactly the type of device that they're designed for.  Since I can't _not_ supply a rating while making this helpful comment, I'm giving 3 stars to not skew things too badly off \\""I guess it's exactly what you'd expect this sort of thing to be.\\""",3,1
"I read laying in bed and this holds my kindle at a better angle than the bigger pillows.  I only gave it a 3 star rating because the fabric, while pretty, is only cotton and it leaks powdery grains that must come off the beans inside. I use it, but wish it were sturdier.",3,2
"Took a while to get my product, considering it came from china. Works like its supposed to although it feels cheaply made like it could easily break.",3,1
"Fits great, image is OK, but it can be better.",3,1
brutus is better,3,1
They work great they're going to work just fine for what I'm intending to use them for,3,1
Seems a little on the cheap side.  The color is lovely.  Not sure about the craftsmanship.  Decided to buy another for a Christmas gift instead.,3,1
Cheap. Get what you pay for.,3,2
I got this for my Toyota corolla. Did all that were suggested to get it programmed myself but it did not work. Had to pay to get it cut and programmed.,3,2
"These foam TV Ear replacement tips are ok, but they are very expensive, and really do not last very long.  I wish I could get them from a different (perhaps an &#34;after market&#34; supplier) but it seems that I can only get them from the TV Ears company.  I never thought that foam tips would wear out.  It used to be that they would DRY out long after you bought foam covered earphones--or that the foam would rip after a very, very long time of use.  But these are only meant to be used for several MONTHS before you have to replace them.<br />All in all, the TV Ears product is a good one, and works well--it does what it is supposed to do.",3,2
"It would be great. Problem is, you have to suck your lungs out to get the Cig. to light up and do anything, and the battery don't last 2 Min's. and the juice in the end sucks through the hole into your mouth and tastes nasty full strength.  I tried the throw-aways first, a little pricey but before I invested in this, I wanted to know what I was getting into. They work, also heavier and larger than normal.  I like the concept of the permanent one, not as heavy and smaller.  More like a real Cig.  just need to get one that works better.",3,2
It wasn't what i thought it was i have some 4 gauge wire that was alot thicker then what i ordered but it did have a lot of parts that i was able to use in the kit so that was nice just was a little disappointed is all in what the kit claimed to be 4 gauge wire.,3,1
"Pros: Clean fit, good instructions, reasonably quick assembly.<br /><br />Cons: missing nuts and bolts in my package, required some tape to close a small visual gap between components.<br /><br />The installation was straightforward after grabbing a nut/bolt set to replace the pair missing in my packaging. I appreciated the flexibility in the mounting screw locations though the plastic is a bit soft and over tightening the radio mount screws could cause an issue.<br /><br />For the price a good value, and user installable.",3,1
"Fits well but scratches easily. Was shipped from Germany . Easy to put on , but make sure you use the rag under the credit card",3,1
ok,3,1
"The menu and function of this device lacks a little substance. other than that, it plays very well, and has really nice sound.",3,1
"The product does a good job of protecting the iPod but the plastic on the front cover is so thick it makes using the wheel difficult. When running I usually have to stop, or at least slow down, to make any adjustments. <br /> <br />I realize it's a trade-off in that if the plastic isn't there there is the opportunity for it to scratch but if you use it for running like me the risk is low and you'll be happier with something that doesn't cover the wheel.",3,1
"This product works as advertised. How well it dose it is another mater. If you are looking for crystal clear sound this is not the product for you. If your looking to listen to the songs on your iPhone it works ok, I do pick up some static and find I have to change frequency if i'm traveling more than 30 minutes from where I live so knowing what stations work well in the area you will be is important. Over all it works well but leaves a lot to be desired in clear sound. I have had some connectivity/comparability issues with the charger connector charges well until I reach 100% and often but not always I get a pop up on my iPhone saying that this device may not be comparable with my iPhone and it stops charging, You might want to save some money and get the one with out the charging connector and just use your iPhone cable with the port on the plug, that's what I have wound up doing anyway to solve this issue. Over all this products works ok.",3,1
"Very nice cover, but its way to delicate at least the outer part which is plastic. It broke fast, not even a month use.",3,2
Probally works fine however it arrived used when it was suppose to be new and was broken and missing parts,3,1
"have a topless jeep and wantedsomething that could stand the weather and be easy to hide (theftproof) so with this amplifier I just jump in my jeep, plug in my cell and Ihe music without a head unit.<br /><br />Sound is not amazing but you can hear music over mud tires doing 55 mph on a topless jeep: Again it does the job according to what<br /><br />I expected.",3,1
"In years past, I've always been a Pioneer fan. Like everything else, even their quality is substandard. The sound quality is okay for this sytem....nothing compared to the Panasonic HC37 that I tried out beforehand (it was great, but did not have an auxilary input nor would it allow an adapator for the iPod dock). I would have accepted the disappointing sound quality, but I had a problem with the CD player skipping and popping. I tired several store-bought CDs (i.e., with music on them) of different ages/sources....none worked well. I tried these same CDs in my Yamaha CD changer and Dell laptop with no problem. I'm returning this item and going back to Panasonic....this time buying the HC35 which DOES have an auxilary input. Can't beat Panasonic for value, and their quality is very high. Try their Lumix cameras! They are out of this world (and I've been a photographer for 40 years).",3,2
bought this product in June 2014 . only one complaint. Battery went dead and will not recharge. I do not recommend you buy this product. can't find a replacement battery. expense will be to much to try and return.<br />Richard Howe. Bought through Amazon.,3,2
"The unit has alot of things, but a decent fit in a stand is not one. It came with a defective charger unit and a cable not made to fit the unit.",3,2
I had great hopes for this battery which by the way took a long time to arrive.<br />It was not even one month old that it does not keep its charge.,3,2
"I am using this in the pool for water exercise. I enjoy it immensely when it works. I have had problems with the earphones cutting out. And I had to jerry rig an old arm brace to keep it on. The Velcro on theirs gets loose with very little movement. But when it works, it is great. Exercising goes by much quicker and the sound is good. I like the fact that it has an FM radio. Which picks up channels very well in the pool. The instructions are little more then useless, but even I, computer challenged as I am, was able to figure enough out to download music from my computer and how to work the FM dial. Again the instructions are pretty useless. I know it can do so much more then I can figure, but I don't need much. I just want to listen to music in the pool and for the money so far, I am getting what I paid for. I hope it lasts. I am really enjoying listening to music in the water, but am not willing to pay the price for the well known name brands out there. I hope this product holds out for awhile",3,1
"I really like this product.  The only drawbacks 1) I have small arms, so it tends to slide a little 2) if your phone is in some sort of case, it will not fit, and you will have to take the case off in order for it to fit in the armband.  Other than that I'm satisfied.",3,1
the product is not as described its CCA wire and not true 0 gauge at most its 4 gauge its does the job on my system but would not of bought product if was described as sold but overall it works decent enough for my mono block,3,1
"It's alright. For $9 I guess it's worth it but you should definitely pay the extra to get something better. The remote worked fine and everything worked as it should, but the sound quality is just pretty bad.",3,2
"Good enough, but not fantastic.",3,1
The screen protectors are as described and do come with a cleaning cloth.  The instructions that come with the screen protectors are not very clear.,3,1
we loved the color. everything was delived with excellence. dont think its for an ipod 3rd generation though. hole isnt there at bottom and there was slits in back. not sure what they are there for. but its a good product.,3,1
"Things I like about the Nav-Cam 7700:  -It is inexpensive.  -It runs Windows Mobile and so with a little bit of work can be set up to run other software.  -It comes with high quality home and car chargers  -It comes with a high quality windshield mount  -The SD slot and music player are useful, you can put MP3 files on the SD card and start the media player, then go into the navigation software. The headphone jack can then be fed to the car's sound system so that you can hear the music and the navigation software prompts over the car system. However, the speaker on the device is fairly powerful and decent quality.  -It has a jack for an external GPS antenna    Things I don't like:  -The power/charge LED on the front is way to bright for nighttime use, you'll want to put some tape over it.  -The software was designed by monkeys, not much in the interface makes sense and simple tasks can be very difficult.  -You can't access the media player without leaving the navigation software, so you can't skip songs while navigating.  -It cannot do Text-to-Speech for road names, though it will say highway numbers.  -It isn't very good at exact street addresses, but it will put you on the right block most of the time.  -It has no provision for saving a track, it would have made a lot of sense to save track information to the SD card.    After I took a trip I left the Nav-Cam in the glove box of the car for a couple of weeks. Now it will not turn on, even with a hard reset. The screen just turns white (backlight turns on) and nothing else happens.    If you want to buy one, be sure you check the return policy first.",3,2
"The TuneTies function as described, however I found that the relatively small size of the product resulted in right wrapping which makes the cord of each of my earbud sets become overly coiled when untied.  So they do keep your earbuds in a small, tidy space, but they also tangle the heck out of the cord when untied.  I used them on 3 different sets (all 3 are a different brand) of earbuds and had the same problem with each.  But that being said, they are relatively inexpensive, which helps make up for their problem.",3,1
"The case is of good quality & well-made, but the NOOK Color just barely fits into it!  It needs to be a little larger so the NOOK could be better protected.",3,1
"Items received promptly. Good price, but 3 star because the wall charger does not work. Took on a planned trip only to find out it did not work. Got home and tried on another Zune and confirmed, does not work. I have e-mailed and called Crazyondigital as instructed on Amazon site. No reply as of yet.",3,2
"The blue checked cover is nice and it stays nicely on the reader.  I was unable to get the protective screen on properly, however, and it seemed to increase glare to an annoying point.  I don't understand why this is bundled with a wisdom/courage wristband.  Overall this was a reasonable purchase.",3,2
"I bought this package mainly for the leather case and screen protector.  My envelope arrived, and there was no leather case inside!  The two rubbery skins are fine, but leather was what I had really counted on.  Also, the screen protector is easy to ruin.  Mine is now worthless because I peeled it the wrong way...so be careful.",3,1
"In order to use this charger for an iPod nano 4th gen you will need to file down the nubs on either side of the iPod interface so that it will fit.<br />For the technologically challenged:<br />You will need to file just a bit on the edge (sides) of the part that plugs into the iPod ON this charger, NOT the dock on the iPod! There aren't any protrusions (nubs) on the iPod anyway...<br />But it DOES WORK and it took less than 5 minutes to fix. So for the price, definitely worth it.",3,2
"I bought to use with my Zune mp3 player, but the device was broken a month to but it. I don't think were these accessories. May be some component failed.",3,2
Does not work on a Two pin Garmin.  I should state that in the description,3,2
It fits the J3 a little loosely but it seems to protect it well. I wish it was available in colors. A smoked color would be really nice and match the player. I may try to dye it. The clear color actually has that nasty yellow look to it at certain angles.<br /><br />Update: I bought some black RIT dye and soaked my case in it to try to darken it. The case does not absorb the dye very well. I first tried for a few hours and it had a slight tint. I tried again on another day and soaked for about 6 hours. It now has a dark enough tint to make it look really nice on the player. I can still barely read the writing on the back of the J3 through it which is exactly what I wanted. I used very hot tap water in a bowl instead of the stove top method so not to distort the case.,3,1
"I've had the HYPERDRIVE COLORSPACE HDCS-000 CASING ONLY for the past 3 years and it has served me well. Good value for the money I paid for it. My only gripe is that when I travel to cold countries, it cannot detect the installed hard drive! I'm not sure if the problem is with the casing or if it's the hard drive I installed.",3,1
"its hard to rate a warranty that you havent needed to use yet, but the price is fair for the length of the warranty, so , so far so good",3,1
The last for some time...and colorfull...my daughters love them...do not take them off the ipod too much or you will risk tearing them...,3,1
"The blue tooth didn't work with my phone when I called tech support the guy was arrogant not polite & tole me it only works with the I phone ... which was not true. I had to get a new phone & the bluetooth worked with my new phone. He also told me I should have know that, I looked everywhere & no where was the make of the phones it works with listed.",3,2
"I got because I thought it was a good idea to protect the screen and I thought the neck strap design would be useful. Trouble is you have to take it out of this case in order to download songs and charge the battery because it opens on bottom of the player. I didn't realize what a problem this would be until I actually used the thing.<br /><br />Might I suggest you get the belt clip leather case instead; it is made by the same company, also has a neck strap (as well as a belt clip and closing cover) and costs about the same amount. Both are designed to fit the Zen Vs (V Plus is the same size as V) but, the top opening design makes it so you never have to remove the player from the case.",3,2
"Nice product.  Works great.  They beep when you press the button.<br />Suggestions...<br />Maybe have the beepers vibrate as well in case it is under a cushion or something where you cant hear it as well.  It would be better for elderly people who can't hear too.<br />Make them in different sizes.  I would be fine with one that just beeped if it were the size of a quarter.  The bulky one should beep and vibrate.  Who has four seperate sets of keys to clip these big things too.  Make one for a wallet, one for keys, one that clips to your phone, a remote control and maybe a hat.<br />Still, it is a good product.",3,1
"It works very well, immediately I could synchronize with my radio and hear great, only thing is that it does not fit the car's cigarette lighter and therefore the weight of the iPhone wins and goes to one side. Still can not use the hands free, do not know how to operate it.",3,1
"great lights , not to mention you will need the socket adapters",3,1
"Great bargain. Good first mp3, easy to understand. There's a slight sound distortion, but I was looking for an ultra affordable player for recorded seminars etc. You can't beat the price.",3,1
"This was my second, kids broke first. They have changed the software and I don't like it as much anymore, seems there are better options.",3,2
"IT IS NOT WORKING RIGHT, BUT THAT IS WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN SOME IS VERY CHEAP.  WI;; TRY AND PURCHASE ANOTHER ONE IN THE NEAR FUTURE.",3,2
"I loved the Tardis decoration on this, but the case felt cheap and like it would offer no protection whatsoever against an accidental drop. I went back to my silicone case but will keep this for my girls, who are unparalleled Whovians.",3,2
Item is Not Full HD it is just HD on maximal resolution video recorded by 15Fps.It should set the worst resolution to record video by 30 Fps,3,2
"Worked great picture and sound is amazing, had it for a month now and the car charger stopped working had to buy another one....",3,1
thought it should have had more padding in it to protect my GPS.........I have to be very care with it to protect the screen from pressure.,3,1
"I was a little disappointed with how long it took to arrive and when it finally did show, it was not quite like the picture. Their are no holes in the back to let the sound out. I sent them a note about my displeasure on the delivery  and they wrote me back. They were very nice about it so I give them deserved credit for that. All in all, it's O.K....",3,2
Not bad,3,2
"For a $6 case, its nice. Its main job is to help the iPod assume a flirty, flashy look, which it does very nicely, but as far as protection, there isn't much. It's thin plastic that doesn't connect to the front... not exactly the best protection, but it looks nice!<br /><br />If you're looking for something to protect your iPod from cracking, do NOT purchase this!!<br /><br />If you simply want something that looks nice, its an A+!",3,1
Cute case.  Stylus wasn't included as shown in the description and picture.  Disappointed about that.  The tail is also a little hokey  and doesn't stay on,3,2
"These work, but will not work well for an iPad in a Lifeproof case on a charging stand.",3,1
"Item was used but in fair condition. It took longer to receive the product then the time stated. The product improved my satellite signal by 10 dB. Didn't improve my signal greatly. Still was worth a shot. Overall, it is a slight improvement.",3,1
When i ordered this i was very excited but when it came i was putting it on and one of the clasps broke off. i think as long as you put it on carefully it will be perfectly fine.,3,2
"*** November 27, 2011<br /><br />After trying umpteen zillion cheap iPhone cables only to end up with umpteen zillion cables that don't work, or only work part of the time, I finally got an [[ASIN:B004TIIBMS RND cable]] -- a 6 ft white one.  It was great, so I ventured out to get another RND cable -- this 10 ft one.  It too works great!<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer that the connection doesn't totally latch tight. Being heavier/thicker cables also makes these RNDs slightly more likely to detach.  For myself though, I haven't found this to be a problem.  They stay in perfectly fine.<br /><br />Over the upcoming months if either of my RND cables stops working I will be back in here to update my review.  At this point, however, these RND cables are by far the most reliable iPhone cables I have come across.<br /><br />*** UPDATE - March 19, 2012<br /><br />My cable stopped charging or syncing.  I wrote to the company  (RND Power Solutions) saying that my cable stopped working.  Within just a few hours they responded saying that for one of their cables to stop working was rare, and that they would send me a replacement.  Well, they did.  I just got it -- very fast -- within about 3 business days of my writing to them.<br /><br />RND backed up their product with no hassles, no muss, no fuss.  I am very pleased.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy from RND again.  In fact, since I just left my shorter [[ASIN:B004TIIBMS RND cable]] at a conference, I have just ordered another one.  I like it when a company backs up their product, and does so in a hassle free way.<br /><br />As an interesting aside, my first 10 ft RND cable did have a slight bit of a loose connection on the iPhone side.  However the one I just received doesn't.  The connection is firm.  Perhaps they tightened this up a bit since earlier versions.<br /><br />*** UPDATE July 3, 2012<br /><br />I have now had a second one of these cables die -- in less than a year from the original purchase.  (This second cable lasted less than four months.)  While I suppose I could write to the company as I did last time the cable died, and they may replace it a second time, I hate doing that.  I just want a cable that works well, and keeps on working for a reasonable amount of time (certainly for at least a year).  I have now dumped this cable and purchased a Griffin.<br /><br />I am also lowering my rating from 5 stars to 3 stars.  Two stars for it working well when it actually does work, and a third star for the company replacing the product the first time it died.",3,1
"Kinda of cheap and flimsy. Looks easy to use but instructions are very confusing and not translated well. If I ever get proficient at it, it will be great and for the price it can get banged around a bit without me getting upset. Perfect for on the go.",3,1
"It fits my ipod perfectly and does the job, but the velcro on the outside of the band gets stuck to my gym shirts which is messing them up. If I can't find a solution, I'm just going to have to look for another one.",3,1
i thought it would be bigger and actually hold up the ipad but i guess not. it is pretty small.,3,2
no instructions but well made,3,1
"i had recently bout this the amp is way to small to let the subs show what they can do, you can buy the same pair for cheeper or buy this and sell the amp my company was shock that kenwood would pull some cheep trick.",3,1
"It didn't fit my nook, but I am using it nonetheless. Its pretty but the back piece muffles the speaker.",3,1
The Book Beanie is very cute but was MUCH smaller and lighter than expected.  I bought this for use with a Kindle in a cover.  I thought it was too small and not stable enough for that use but might work OK for a Kindle not in a cover or for holding a smart phone.  The fabric quality is typical quilting weight fabric.  Inside was stuffed with bean bag pellets but not many.   I would rate this higher if it was bigger and sturdier.,3,2
The seller was quick but the transmitter was the weakest FM transmitter I've ever used. Too annoying having to change stations when I didn't have to with the one I bought from Monoprice.,3,1
This product is overall okay. I am experiencing a little static when it's connected to my IPod but overall no complaints. The static is not bad to where I cant hear my music.,3,2
"Came a bit dirty, otherwise, it's fine.",3,1
"If this product operated in 64 bit, I would give it 5 stars!  My 6 year old loves the games, they are challenging, progressive, rewarding and could be a whole homeshool curriculum in itself!  There are activities for following direction which usually add a personal touch to the look of the game, such as adding a picture of your child onto a billboard within the game.  There are 12 levels starting at letter sounds and ending with compound words.  Math starts at recognizing numerical value and ends in double digit addition and subtraction.  It is such a wonderful product, I would consider spending the money for a computer system that would be compatible.  However, customer support is so lacking that I just can't justify it.",3,1
"Product as described, fits perfectly, made well. The one issue is that the top button isn't perfectly accessible, its sort of deep in the case, you really have to get your finger in there, but its not a button you need to be using all the time. Its not a HUGE issue, some may like it anyways, because if your ipod is dropped free edges are definitely saved from any possible dings.",3,1
"It is a little thinner than others I have seen, but seems to do the job.",3,1
"The product is as described. I just wish there was more instructions to be found on this thing. I'm not an expert, but I believe it should start recording automagically everytime I start my car, without me doing anything other than installing it properly. The initial instructions are in Russian.",3,1
"I purchased three of these and one died quickly and two are working ok.  It does not seem to have an over-current protection circuit.  So when a device is used that draws more current (amps) than it is rated for, it dies.  :o/",3,2
Ok,3,1
"Its decent, have mine on my rear windshield at the top, and some normal stations are still a little staticky but now terrible, better than nothing!!",3,2
"Used the speaker about 2 months.  It started cracking a lot, then finally, it would no longer sync to anything.  :(  Was great while it lasted.<br /><br />*** I received a sample of this product to evaluate at little or no cost, I was under no obligation to post a review or give positive feedback. I choose to review this product  in order to inform others of my experience.",3,2
This cover smells bad. I gave it away. It protects the reader but the smell is awful. I wouldnt recommend buying.,3,2
"The case is made of quality plastic and snaps onto the new ipod nano just s advertised. My only concern is that moisture still can get under the case, and it's very difficult to remove once it's snapped on--there's no quick release. But for the $2 price tag, I can't say I didn't get what I paid for. Serves its purpose but not fancy.",3,1
"Pro:<br /> All the features you need for dash cam:  come with hard-wire cable (to be safe, you need to buy 2 add-a-circuit), didn't come with cigarette adapter but seller sent  it right after contacted , GPS, Cut-off Voltage, Parking mode...<br />Con:<br /> Blurry video (default UV filter already off), video bit rate 11000kbps, audio bit rate 256kbps, 16 kHz compares to A118 I had for short period of time, video bit rate 15000kbps, audio bit rate 512kbps, 32kHz.<br /> Inconvenience when need to change the settings, have to take the SD card off<br /> Low viewing angle.<br /> Have to cheat to get the time right/<br />Bottom line: if you want a full feature single channel dash cam with so so video (compare to A118) , this is for you, and if video is more important, look somewhere else.",3,1
"CON: The photo is darker than the color of the real item. The footprint of the unit is bigger than stated because you need about 20\\"" off the wall to let it revolve. Big and much bulkier than expected. The edges of the pieces capping the sides hide the first and last DVD, so you have to put a boxed set or a piece of wood on the shelf to expose all the DVDs.<br /><br />PRO: Plenty of shelves. Easy to put together. Holds a boat load of DVDs.",3,1
Not too excited about these. Hard to get on screen without bubbles even though I follow the instructions that were given.,3,2
"Sound comes in very clear, but it does not fit very well with my otter box. i had to take off the case in order to use the transmitter.",3,1
"Had to give it 3 stars.<br /><br />Cons: Cheap materials, USB cable that came with my order worked for less than 4 minutes, earphones included are also poor quality, instructions are useless, buttons are confusing, no shuffle.<br />Pros: Great sound quality, price is great, loading is easy.<br /><br />Everything was working well on my first use. Less than 4 minutes of loading my music it stopped working. At first I thought it was my laptop. It wasn't my laptop. Had my son try it on his newer laptop and it didn't work. Tried it on my husband's laptop and it still didn't work. Until finally we tried using our iPod USB cable and it worked. So, the culprit was the USB cable that came with my order. I didn't return the cable since there's nothing wrong with the MP4 and earphones. Not worth returning. I just use our iPod USB cable instead. As for the sound quality of this device...it is awesome. It works well with my mini-speakers and my earphones (not the included earphones). I didn't like that every time I turn it on it goes back to your first song. I bought this because I've read in one of the reviews that it has shuffle. well, so far I have not discovered that function. Reason why I bought this MP4 is to replace my Sansa MP3 with a broken audio button (manufacturer defect that they never corrected) and its price. I only want to listen to music when I'm traveling. I still have to find out how long the battery will last when I travel. Its buttons are still confusing to me and I have to tinker with it more. Overall this MP4 is not bad at all for its price. If your purpose is to listen to your songs, then this is a great buy even if the materials are of cheap quality. One has to consider that this has 8GB.",3,2
"NEW X6000 5mp Dual Camera Car DVR Night Vision Black Box with GPS Drive Route Record<br /><br />It work good and nice looking and like the size of item.<br />But, there are two things really disappointed me.<br />1. Delivery Take too long (over 30days)<br />2. On the Amazon web site; didn't say anything about what size of memory card goes in the camera, and no options to purchase memory card.<br />When I received item it is only fit TF Memory card (very small memory card; same size as memory card is in the cell phone), so I had order TF memory card through another seller, it cost $22.24 more.",3,1
I purchased this amp thinking that i could get away with it for my mid and high end speakers but unfortunately I was wrong.  This amp has a lot of power but it is not real clean power.  I will try to use it on subs and see how they work.  The amp does not seem to heat up and the crossover seems to adjust ok I tried to find the THD on this unit thinking that may be the problem but could not find it.  I have purchased a higher end 4 channel amp with less than 1% THD to replace this one.  If this amp works well with subs I will add to this post.,3,2
"The device worked most of the time, but I had to get accustomed to it.  Also the part that plugs into the iPod has a tendency to come particially loose and it doesn't work at all when its loose.",3,2
This case was very protective and was a great deal. I do wish that the back looked a little better though and came in colors (back is clear.) I purchased a skin for my ipod and now it looks great! It also makes my ipod look like and iphone (which is awesome) :),3,1
This worked great for about 3 months then suddenly the memory card would not be accepted. I do not know why. When I insert the card it says &#34;No memory card. Insert memory card.&#34;<br /><br />Also when I got it it was in Chinese or Japanese and I had to stumble around till I found how to change the language. Irritating.<br /><br />They sent the wrong cable with the device. Easy enough I bought the correct one. Irritating as well.,3,2
The items I received were in good condition e work very well but one of the envolopes was cut as someone had tried to open it with scissors or knife. The item inside was ok. The only thing missing was the sticker of Amazon!  Anyway all items are ok and work properly.,3,2
"fast shipping, good product but came damaged but will replace it. Phone cases are not expenxive so it's not worth shipping it back.  I'll just order a new one.",3,2
"It seems quite robust and the material is fluffy. We already have two turtle night lights and I got this for my third daughter. What I don't like about this one is the music feature. It is very annoying when music blasts out as you are trying to get your child to sleep. We are constantly trying to avoid the music button and I wish there was a way to permanently disable this button. Also, if a child rolls over the button while sleeping, the music would just start playing. And these are no soft lullabies, but rather quite loud midi/synthesized music. The toy itself is nice and I love the light variations but if I had known how disturbing to sleep the music would be, I would have just bought another turtle night light.",3,2
I test in different simulated situations but sometimes the unit doesn´t send the GPS position.,3,1
"I'm not sure how I feel about this, to be honest. On the plus side, it's a great price and iTouch Generation 5 cases aren't easy to come across yet (at least not compared to the iPhones), especially for TV shows and things. It arrived in the mail much quicker than it said it would, which was nice. However, it just looks kind of cheap. Some of the text is a little blurry (the &#34;Pull to Open&#34; sign, part of the Police Public Call Box part, etc.) which bothers me and some of the white parts came with spots on them (they aren't THAT noticeable. I don't think my friends would see it, but obviously I did). Also, the material it's made out of is kind of strange. It kind of looks like wood, which I guess is accurate for the TARDIS, but I just wasn't fond of it. And finally, it doesn't look like it will protect the device at all. I didn't buy it for protection, really. More so because I like Doctor Who and needed something to keep the back from getting scratched. Although, in the past I've bought a bunch of plastic, snap on cases and they've all offered a little bit more protection than this (at least enough that I didn't think my iPod would shatter if I dropped it).<br /><br />In the end, it's not a bad buy. It looks fairly nice and from far away you probably can't see the errors. But you get what you pay for. I'll use it for a little while, until I get something better. If you're a Whovian and looking for a cheap case, you can probably do worse.",3,1
"this is  a handy armband, but i got it for a walkman and getting to the volume is a problem",3,1

Bought this because I thought the AV cord that came with my dual screens wasn't working. When I plugged this AV cord in NOTHING happened. It didn't work with these screens! It did however turn out that it was the original power cord that was at fault so the new power cord solved my problem. I am saddened that the AV cord didn't work because it is much longer than the original and I have one child forward facing and the other rear facing so I have to stretch the cords a little farther.,3,1
"Product was received promptly. That's where the happiness ends.<br /><br />All this unit is, is a pair of Analog Television Rabbit Ears, like once used before HDTV laws passed in 2008 or so. I tried everything, outdoor, indoor, suggested length, other lengths. The rubber duck mast that came on my Failsafe Transmitter has better range.<br /><br />****UPDATE****<br />Though I've yet to optimize this Antenna for my use, I did hear from the manufacturer. He said he must have sent wrong directions, that the antenna actually does go both ways. My problem? Of course, I live in a mobile home. Aluminum siding, no attic. There is, quite literally, no attic to place this in, and the house's siding seriously reduces all transmission. The solution?<br /><br />Mount a piece of PVC to the side of the house or in the ground. Where I am, it's windy, so it also has to be encased in a plexiglass box to both protect from rain and falling debris from wind. It IS a set of Rabbit Ears, there's no getting around that, and like an antenna on the back of the shop radio, handled the wrong way, will snap like a twig. I am still not sure I can even use this, but I'll certainly try. Though it seems, I will have to part the red sea to make it happen.",3,2
"The case is okay, however, it was hard to fit it onto the Latte ICE Smart and it doesn't cover it as much as I would have liked.",3,1
This item is ok but the buttons does not line up correctly not sure why,3,2
"I have owned three different versions of this item. The store-bought one was the real McCoy, with a nice LCD display that showed track name, number, and other information with a pleasant font. It remembered which station the FM transmitter was set to even when powered down. It was very nice until some goon at Belle Tire smashed it and wrecked it (thanks, jerk.)<br /><br />I replaced it with two of these from online.  Each one looks like the retail version on the outside, but they are of cheaper build with less useful firmware. They both have ugly displays, like an old digital watch. The screen may be LCD, but it's incapable of displaying track or artist names, instead assigning each track a number and showing only that.<br /><br />Neither of these Chinese knock-offs will remember the FM station, instead resetting every time to default settings.<br /><br />One had horrible mushy buttons that caved in with minimal use. It also had a remote control on which the front panel was poorly glued, causing it to fall off and cease functioning.<br /><br />So here's the problem: It appears that it's impossible to know whether you will get a good one, or the cheap Chinese junky of varying degrees. Even ordering from a US vendor is no guarantee that you get a decent unit. If you get the nice, original version you will be very pleased. If you get the halfway decent Chinese knock-off you will probably still like it. If you get the junky Chinese rip-off, though, you will hate it and won't get much use out of it.<br /><br />For the record, when you get a good one, it's great at playing music from an SD card, your mp3 player, or USB. I have been very happy with the retail model, and mostly happy with the better knock-off (except that I have to re-tune the knock-off every time I start my car).<br /><br />Caveat emptor. I would advise not ordering any that ship from China. They won't be worth the wait.",3,1
"I purchased this for my Nuvi 3490 LMT.<br />I saw the measurement and I knew it was bigger than my GPS but I bought it anyway.  I was hopping it was going to be somewhat of a snug fit hence the description says it was compatible with the 3490.<br /><br />way too big in my opinion, I wish I would've just returned it but it would've been too much trouble for me.<br /><br />It's ok for things with screens larger than 4.3.  I wouldn't recommend this for screens at 4.3 or smaller.  The pouch is way too big and it slides around in there...",3,2
"Not so great, they work, but they spark and shock you .... they're a fire hazard",3,1
I like the quality. The only complaint I have is that it left a bunch of black marks all over my nook. I'm not sure if I will be able to get it off.,3,1
"The silicone cover was a little bit loose,it pushes up the extra silicone around the \\""Next Page\\"" button on the right.  The screen cover was easy to put on but it glares like a plastic mirror. The manufacturer tag has glue that was very difficult to remove. Left glue mark on the screen cover. Overall, it was an okay product.  No buyer's remorse but would have like to have a cover that fits more snuggly.",3,1
"the speaker worked as it is supposed to. However, the box came in without the mount and manual. I have been duct taping the speaker onto my bike. Also, it will be nice it comes with manual so I know how all the bottoms work.",3,1
"Product does last for awhile, however the Glare that comes off the screen protector becomes rather annoying.   Installation is also average as the cloth used to push the air out from beneath the protector also can scratch the protecter.",3,1
"Only give this a Three star because of the fast shipment that the seller provided. The quality of the decoration molding trim was horrible. Most of the trim was unable use due to the silver coming off. I found another way to still use the trim and it was by spray painting the whole trim. Have to sand every thing down in order for the paint plus primer to stick. It look good, but if I buy another trim I buy the another color not this one.",3,2
"I fully expect the Bluetooth to be flawless and it is, but this doesn't merit gushing reviews on this cheaper Jambox rip off.  I got this today, and ordered my return shipping pickup for tomorrow.  The sound is only satisfactory. I'm no audiophile, but I will use this thing every day, and I'd like my experience to be, \\""wow!\\"" instead of \\""I wish...\\""  Nope.  I'm gonna use this every day and there's no room for \\""I wish..\\""  I went to Target to demo a Jambox so I could see if ALL such speakers sound mediocre, and the sound is INCOMPARABLE.  The Jambox blows the tinny sounding Beatblock out of the water and into another dimension.  Spacial sound with crisp highs and lows versus a mid-range drone.  Good sound should be experienced like buckets of fingerling potatoes falling on you, not like a muffled ooze of mashed potatoes filling your space with, \\""I wish.\\""  Sorry. Boo.  Ordering a Jambox.  Sounded better than the Bose I also demo'd.",3,1
"Pros:<br /><br />Amazing set of features<br /><br />Price<br /><br />Customer Support<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Nothing is done right<br /><br />Sound is blah-blah<br /><br />MP3 navigation<br /><br />Placement of controls<br /><br />I admit, I thought I could get away with buying a generic eighty dollar stereo. I was wrong. This stereo is great for the guy who doesn't mind using dollar store headphones and can listen to radio stations from the other state. However if you want to ever have a respectable sound system, you do not want to build off of this stereo. I used it for three months. The beginning was awesome, mainly because I was used to listening off an FM transmitter. This wears off quickly however. Most people who rode in my car told me that it seemed like there was something muffling the speakers. I spent hours trying to make it sound nice, soldering, re wiring, and tuning the EQ, but it was ultimately a battle lost. I spent twice this unit's price to buy another stereo, and it was worth every penny (and I'm a poor college kid). My aftermarket speakers come to life now, and I've got nothing but compliments on how crisp everything sounds.<br /><br />There's also the annoying feature where the music starts over from the beginning of the song every time you change sources or power the radio on and off. I didn't think it would be all that annoying, but it is outright painful.<br /><br />Don't plan on doing anything other than shuffle for your MP3s, it's way to complicated and slow to navigate through the folders. Somebody also thought it might be a good idea to have the titles slowly roll out, that guy needs to be fired.<br /><br />I would like to point out, that the customer service on this stereo is outstanding. They replaced it once within three days when it broke.<br /><br />Sorry to sound like a whiner, I really, really wanted to like this radio, but it's not worth the trouble. If you're on a budget, I'd recommend buying a low end pioneer or sony xplod.",3,2
"Great product for the price you get it for. You may have to re-glue the Velcro to the band, but the product will last you a while. I usually get 2 of them a year. I would recommend this product to the people who want to get something quick and cheap.",3,1
"Each of these three cases fit my phone perfectly. I did not like the design of the rhinestones, they were too much of the main color. They would have been nicer if there was silver on the case beneath the colored stones.",3,1
"Good for finding the car in a large parking lot after the game.  GPS locks on quick after power is turned on, interface is simple to understand and use.",3,1
"Package came on time, but the fuse in the product wasn't working. Although it is very easy to take apart and fix",3,2
"Pros:  Cheap, effective, crystal clear, you get three!    Cons:  Cheaply made, scratch VERY easily, I've used up two of them already in less than a month, not the greatest fit, and rainbowing on the screen under bright lights.    Overall:  Pretty good product but don't expect to last it forever if you want your phone to look nice. Also, be careful during installation; the fit is pretty good but tends to leave a gap on either the top or the bottom, because of this the opposite side is not very Apple Bumper-friendly. Be careful.    Anyway, they're cheap enough to try them out and I like them better than the tacky feel from the InvisibleShields even though they're not nearly as resilient.",3,1
The product arrived on time. It does Not charge my phone but it's good enough for the price I paid.  Remote control is a nice feature.,3,1
"This version seems to have issues every now and again. If I don't format my card every 2-5 weeks it will lock up and not work correctly. Other then that it seems to be working but given the pricepoint I'm not satisfied. I thought it was my card, I thought it was other things. By the time I found out it wasn't it was a week past the warranty period. Now I'ms tuck with it and they were  not of any real help.<br /><br />The recorded quality is fine. The unit does get a bit hot but I have not had any issues, and its size is a great plus. This specific model though I would avoid unless or until the bugs are worked out. If you have an issue report to them right away.<br /><br />I'm not happy with their customer satisfaction but on the same note I can understand it took me awhile to actually look into this and then try to resolve it so they don't believe me. But seriously, a week outside of warranty? I could even prove I purchased a new card. Seems silly to me.",3,2
Fits around the iPod well and offers protection while maintaining an attractive streamlined look.  It does make the power button a bit of a challenge to access.,3,1
"not very durable.  This one is hard to get on and off the ipod, and I've had to use a butter knife each time.  My kids like the design, though.",3,1
Really nice folks.  And it had such a great price.<br /><br />The FM transmitter worked...but the charging function did not. We requested direction from the vendor and tried everything the suggested but we could not get the iPhone 5s to charge...<br /><br />We recieved a fill rebate from the vendor. Very professional. Wished it worked.,3,1
"I purchased this for my son's nook.  He loves the decal art.  On the downside, he finds that the strap on the corner of the jacket interferes with the volume control. He also takes the nook out of the case quite a bit so he can hear better.  If I could change one other thing, I would design the jacket to stand on its own for viewing.  Overall this was a good buy for the price.",3,1
"Doesn't quite fit the brain out of my factory OEM Toyota key. Main arm/panic button sticks in depressed position because the cutouts are barely .5 mm too small. I may be able to shave the hole bigger with some fine sandpaper, but haven't tried yet. Other than that one crucial flaw, the color is cool and it seems sturdy!",3,1
"While this item provides basic protection for the 6 year old who uses it, it will not take harsh treatment in a rough and tumble bedroom shared by 2 young children.",3,1
"Sadly, I rarely use the armband portion of the case as it looks like it would pop off.  I like having it around my iPod to give a little more cushion when I'm at the gym.<br /><br />It's fairly cheaply made and I don't think it would work on my thicker arms.",3,2

"It much more smaller than what I thought it was going to be. The pen didn't work very well, it takes a lot of pressure to make it work.

"This product is fun - the wristband is one of those slap bracelets we all had as kids, and the rubber case fits the iPod well. I do like the color and as a whole it basically works.<br />That being said...<br />The case can slip around on the bracelet quite a bit. It doesn't slip to the point that it would fall off the bracelet by itself, but if you're like me, you wear the iPod on your wrist or forearm because you like to access the menu and change songs, volume, etc., while running. I've found that it's not unusual to reach to change something and find the iPod has slipped a little. This wouldn't be a problem, but when you go to adjust the placement in order to access the menu, you can find the case difficult to move without it slipping off the band completely. So then you're fumbling around quite a bit while trying to run - if you're on a treadmill, not a big deal, but if you're on the road I'd be careful. The rubber doesn't exactly help with the sweat factor either.",3,1
"Had a very hard time fitting the screen protector on the screen. Thought I finally had it, put on the case, and it made the edges buckle on the screen protector, on all sides of it. If you're wanting this product along with a screen protector, forget it. Other than that, the case with the cute little button, will fit great. For this reason I only gave 3 stars.",3,1
The scratch fixer is not worthy; but the clean & polish worked good.,3,1
"While it does a good job providing protection for my iPod, it is relatively thick, which makes it difficult for my headphones to stay attached.  It is also near impossible to remove the case.",3,1

If you are a larger man, this is not for you.<br /><br />They work great for my kids, but I am going to say these should be marked with a size as they do not fit all.",3,2
"I don't love it, but it will do in a pinch.  It does not fit exactly as I thought it would and the buttons are not easy to push while in the case.  It is okay as far as protecting the iPod and serves it's purpose...just not what I expected it to be.",3,1
I received it in a reasonable amount of time. It is easy to use. The only problem i have with it is that the volume doesn't go up very high.,3,1
"At first it is difficult to find a free radio station and the radio signal is a bit short. But it works perfect if you're on the road, also in the city. I agree with the price and the product",3,1

"I'd say that the review by trebe from Feb 2012 is good and accurate, but I feel that someone needs to say \\""buyer beware\\"" as well as \\""you get what you pay for\\"".<br /><br />I bought it to use as an alarm clock that would play my tunes from USB or SD chip at the time I set.

The item worked well up until a week ago when it would not emit sound at a level that could be heard all the time. When it was new it worked great and always had to turn it down because it would always be to loud. last week it started going in and out while on the job and trying to receive runs,3,2
Is cute but it doesn't fit on the sides that well,3,2
"I would call this a \\""good enough\\"" product.<br /><br />1.) I saw other reviews regarding the leather. NOTE - it is not leather, if you look at the product description it tells you what it is really made of (I cannot think of the word off the top of my head).<br /><br />2.) Purple - it is a deep purple. I, personally, LOVE the color.<br /><br />3.) NOOKColor = tight snug. The bottom, where you slip your NOOK into is not 1 long piece that makes sure your NOOK won't fall out. It has 2 pieces, not even an inch wide, that keep your NOOK from falling out of the bottom. It is snug in the sense that you cannot put anything thicker in it. My NOOKColor fits snuggly (is that a word?), to the point that I had to use extra force to push it all the way in.<br /><br />4.) Too short - I pushed my NOOKColor in as far as I could without the fear of ripping the bottom holders and the top of my NOOKColor sticks out. It is not alot, I cannot even give a measurement to it, but if you are the type of person that notices those things, you will see it.<br /><br />5.) The top elastic bands are so tight, I thought I was not going to be able to use them (then I would return this product), but after wrestling with them, I finally got them on. They are light grey in color. Remember, purple holder, black NOOKColor that juts out a bit with light grey elastic bands...if you did not care about this product being a tad to small, you might care about this. It clashes in the color scheme. We are working with dark, deep colors and they throw in light grey elastic? Come on!<br /><br />6.) It has a magnetic closure that you sometimes have to force. When closing up, you definately have to pay attention to feel the magnets attach.<br /><br />7.) The material looks and feels durable, great stitching. I do not have worry in that area (but I only got this this morning).<br /><br />I bought this because I needed something to tide me over until I could afford a fancy, designer case from Barnes & Noble. It is inexpensive and it will do the job I bought it for. It is good enough, for me, to protect my NOOKColor for a few weeks. Those who are looking for something more longterm...remember, you get what you pay for. If you are the type of person who is really nit picky, well, above is the list you will encounter. I, however, am not when it comes to this product.

"The rear piece went on well and the front went on without any bubbles, howevert eh bottom didn't quite fit well and never really stuck below the home button. I redid it a few weeks later with a new one and this pone has one or two bubbles in it and also doesn't stick at the bottom.  I have used different covers over the years for different devices and have had some that feel great but are hard to use and others that go on well but feel rubbery. This has a great almost-glass like feel (not rubbery at all) when on, but annoying that it doesn't stick well.

"The kids broke the previous cover (rooCASE dual cover,) so instead of another cover that opens up, I was looking to have something that can protect it from the light bumps and knocks.

"I listen to a lot of audio books so I suppose the RCA Lyra RD2850A 20G HDD mp3pro Player seemed like a great Christmas present for me.  And I have to admit that having an mp3 player with more capacity than my PC's old D: drive was a bit of a kick.  The unit is pretty large so it doesn't hide unobtrusively in my jeans pocket like my old Creative MuVo did, but that's ok, I'll clip it to my waistband and hope it stays there.<br />As an engineer, I don't usually RTFM.  I didn't.  The Lyra has a USB I/F and a FAT file system, so Windows 2000 automagically recognizes it as a Removable Disk.  I proceeded to drag and drop 20G of audio books into it, almost 1500 files, into the directory called \MUSIC\.  That's a lot of audio since I listen mostly to low bit rate lectures.  Impressive!<br />A little bit of random button-pushing got the device to profile the contents.  This took a while to complete, but that's fine, consider it part of the initial setup.  After that, some more random button-pushing (a million monkeys, eh?) got some mp3s to play, and even captured my favorite radio show as an mp3. Nice. It was all a bit jumbled in there, though, and sorting by Artist or Artist/Album or even by track title didn't make it possible to locate a 12 lecture series, much less pick out and listen to the 6th lecture.  Hmmm, seems the tags are messed up, I'll have to fix that.  Ok, let's install the software and get serious.<br />Well, that's where the fun began.  The Lyra comes with an application called Lyra DJ.  Lyra DJ has a simple user interface - a big orange button labeled \\""Analyze Device\\"" and a little gray button labeled \\""0 Sets\\"".<br />\\""The main advantage of a simple user interface is that it prevents the user from actually doing anything.\\"" -- banth<br />Push the button and voila'!  Wait several hours for it to analyze the device.  The analysis failed several times.  Ok, I'm a trained professional.  I can handle it.  I deleted most of my audio - a mistake, I realized, but that's what happens when you're wrestling with new hardware at 2AM.  This time the analysis actually completed.  In retrospect, if I had moved the files out of the \MUSIC\ file tree I would have saved myself a lot of hassle.<br />I decided to continue at work, and this is where I realized that having a separate USB cable with a non-standard plug is a disadvantage.  My old Creative MuVo plugged right into the USB port so I didn't have to worry about forgetting the cable.<br />Back at home again I ran the analysis and pushed Lyra DJs little grey button.  It only took a minute or so to create 15 LDJ sets.  The device itself calls these playlists.  Very kewl, *now* I can listen to some audio books... what the....???<br />According to the blurb, Lyra DJ uses \\""advanced acoustical analysis\\"" to \\""create sets of related content\\"".  I'm sure it does, but my tiny engineering mind wasn't able to discern the relationships between the items in the plain vanilla .m3u text-based playlists created by Lyra DJ.  I suspect that if you listen to music and in no particular order, this won't be an issue.<br />I won't bother you with the irritating misspellings on the Lyra DJ app.  Most engineers can't spell anyway.<br />I briefly considered editing the playlists manually, but as I juggled several open files cutting and pasting I realized that I just don't have time to futz with it, especially if I want to load another 18G of audio.  I was going to have to use another app to generate playlists.<br />I also considered modifying the ID tags to enable the RCA Lyra itself to present them in a logical manner.  I don't &$^$ think so.<br />The RCA Lyra also comes bundled with MusicMatch software.  Throw the installation CD away.  Save yourself some trouble and use something already installed on your computer to create playlists.  I settled on WinAmp.  So here's how to do it:<br />Arrange your audio files in a neat, structured manner as subdirectories in the RCA Lyra \MUSIC\ directory.<br />In WinAmp, create a new playlist.<br />Also in WinAmp, Add a folder from your RCA Lyra directory structure to the playlist.  Make sure the files are sorted correctly in WinAmp - if ID tags are messed up the playlist will be scrambled.<br />Still in WinAmp, Save the playlist to the RCA Lyra \lyra_playlists\ directory.<br />From the RCA Lyra menu system, profile the device.<br />It's important to save the playlist to the RCA Lyra so that the .m3u file has the correct paths.<br />Simple, eh?<br />I'm failing to see the benefit of carrying 20G of audio files when a 512M Creative MuVo carries an entire work day of audio.<br />But that's ok, the RCA Lyra RD2850A 20G HDD mp3pro Player is a serious Guy Magnet.<br />Update 1/28/2006:<br />After having used the RCA Lyra RD2850A 20G HDD mp3pro for a year I really have come to like it.  I continue to generate the playlists in WinAmp, which is just fine.  I don't use the Lyra software at all, though it runs just fine under Windows XP SP2.<br />My best estimate is that I have over 300 hours of music, lectures and audio books in my RCA Lyra RD2850A 20G HDD mp3pro Player, with a few G left over for schlepping files back and forth to work.  If I were so inclined I could rip my entire CD collection into there.<br />And it's still a serious guy-magnet.your RCA Lyra directory structure to the playlist.

"At first, I was pretty annoyed with these chargers, since the adapters they sent did not fit into the appropriate slot on my Archos player.  After an exchange with Gomadic Tech Support (who were fast and friendly), I learned that their adapter was, in fact, a correct fit except for some extra plastic 'keys' on one side.  Basically, these needed to be removed for the adapter to fit.  They gave me a choice.  Either they could remove these for me and send me some new adapters, or I could force the adapters into the slot (essentially shaving off the keys myself). <br /> <br />I chose the latter option, since I did not feel like mailing things back and forth.  It did work, and now the chargers function fine.  Of course, it seems like the adapters should have been molded to fit the unit properly in the first place........ <br />",3,1

Having the track number show up is useful to go back to the track if you want to replay it.

Then once it had started recording I could put the power cord back in. I'm not sure how I figured this trick out, but this is what I did for about 8 months to get the camera to work.

"My review will be the content of a message I sent to the CE Compass support team.  I recently purchased a bluetooth mini keyboard to use with my Motorola Xoom and I have a question and a couple of suggestions for you.  Is there an Android keyboard preferences support application? One that would allow the user to change things such as cursor size and color, cursor acceleration and programming the right mouse button function.  Since this keyboard is best utilized as a thumb keyboard, I would suggest removing the shift key and the function key from the top of the keyboard and replacing them with corresponding keys on each corner of the top leading edge of the keyboard to be operated by the left or right index fingers of the user as needed. This would allow you to rearrange the bottom and edge keys enabling the enlargement of the space key by 2 segments.  This keyboard filled the need of a specific systems interface solution for me and is OK in my particular application, but this keyboard would not fill my needs in a productivity enviornment. I use the Thumb Keyboard 4 application on my tablet for typing and navigation productivity.  I hope this is helpful.",3,1
"I am please with the item, but the gamepad does not feel like it's made for iPod touch 4g as the product title suggests. When the iPod touch 4g is inserted into the gamepad, it fits loose making it hard to play games. My solution to the fitting issue was to place the iPod touch along with a case on the gamepad. This added more size all around the iPod touch making it fit inside the gamepad quite well. However, for any  person that play games on the iPod touch knows the heat the device can generate, and adding more material (device with case+gamepad) to block the iPod touch's heat raditation can result performance drop or hardware damage. So be cautious of the product's fitting compatibility with the iPod touch 4g.",3,2
"After having plunked down a sizable stack of cash for my disappointing pair of overpriced B&O A8 earbuds, only to have my first negative experience after 30+ years of B&O purchases, and my incredibly uncomfortable, overpriced, and overrated Shure E2c's, I found these recommended by a tech magazine. When I found that they were only $20, I decided \\""why not?\\""  I was not disappointed .. mainly due to the fact that although these were not audiophile by any means, they delivered more bass than I had heard from any headphones in a while, and the remainder of the audio spectrum was fairly good as well.  <br /> <br />No more shoving oversized ear buds three-quarters of the way into my ear canal that took about half of a flight to get into just the right position for lackluster bass and clarity (as with the Shures).  <br /> <br />On the mid- to high-end of the spectrum, the Earsubs show their price point. Especially at higher volume. Also, the bass output is obviously exaggerated. You will have to reduce the bass settings of your source, whether it be an iPod or other device. <br /> <br />I have spent a lot of money in sound equipment over the years. I consider myself an audiophile. However, I listen differently to music when I am using my iPod versus when I am listening to CDs and vinyl at home. I don't expect my iPod headphones to give me audiophile sound, because the iPod is not capable of reproducing anything better than mp3 or \\""lossless\\"" AAC. For this reason, the Earsubs fill the gap nicely. They offer a decent level of bass, as long as you drop the bass of the source to lower-than-normal settings. Just don't expect these to give good sound at high volume. Overdrive them, and transients will sound like tennis ball meets racquet.",3,1

"I found a few things lacking with this flashlight, such as Bosch being behind the curve in offering a LED version - or conversion to LED as some conventional flashlight makers such as MAG offer. Second, is the lack of a storage place for the flashlight in Bosch drill cases. Lastly, it is only marginally bright and given all the bulb choices today this is somewhat surprising.     Also, having also ordered the Bosch 36618-02 18v Li-Ion drill kit I found there is no place to put the flashlight. The top of the well built case is molded for a side support handle that this drill/driver does not use and the bottom of the case has a molded area above the charger that would otherwise appear to fit the flashlight. No thanks to the engineer that designed this case.    When I contacted Bosch about that they did not seem to care & simply stated \\""that's the way it is\\"". Wow! What contractor or homeowner wouldn't want to have a place to put an approx. #50 flashlight to keep get damaged?! Without a battery in place, the contacts of the flashlight are exposed & unprotected as many drill flashlights do these days making a place to put it desirable.     If not for the reputation and quality of the related drill that the batteries are used with, I would have chosen another brand of drill such as Milwaukee that offers a LED version flashlight. Having made the (Bosch brand) drill & battery reputation my main priority, I reluctantly chose the Bosch flashlight as my rechargeable project light. The stand is nice in a limited way as it has set detents and enables the light to be hung or hooked on a nail/screw, but it may not always offer the best angle when aiming the light and it stores folded over the lense blocking the light if used as normally stored. This also makes the light somewhat longer when the handle is moved out of the way to use which diminishes its otherwise compact shape. All-in-all, the ONLY choice for the 18v Litheon drills making it a forced choice if someone wants reasonable run time and a light powered by their rechargeable drill batteries.",3,1

It plugs in just fine into the Mini USB port on the Tap and it a regular 3.5 mm headset plugs in just fine. The only thing that i have against this product is that the sound quality is diminished.

I have even put the volume all the way up to make sure i can here the music or video and it is still pretty low. All in all i do prefer to use my own headphones instead of some crappy USB headphones. Side not this is literally the only adapter you can find for the Tap.

"Id have to go with the crowd on this one, pretty disappointed with this item.  While I wouldn't give it 1 star, (it did show up, description matches item, it is anti glare, and it didnt like catch on fire or blow up or anything), but it is deficient in several areas.  I really liked the Marware case, which is why I had high expectations for this item as well.  The applicator helped get most of the bubbles out from under the protector, but mine still lifts around the very edges. This leaves me the feeling I'll go through the 2 screens rather quickly as they'll lift and peel, allowing dirt and dust to comb between the screen and the protector. The cleaning cloth provided is probably insufficient to get the screen as clean as it should be before application.  Id recommend getting a good screen cleaner and wiping down with that first (if you have a lot of screens,I highly recommend the Bryson Screen Cleaner, 16 oz. Spray Bottle also sold on Amazon).  The anti-glare film on the screen protector is very pro-smudge.  Before I was done getting all the air pockets out, using a combination of the applicator and my finger tips, the entire thing was a swirly smudgy mess.  The occurrence of smudges continues on from here as evidenced with daily usage.  I found it was this pro-smudge effect of the anti-glare screen that made the text hard to read.  Live and learn I guess. I think others have recommended the clear version of this item.  Id definitely look at something else. Wish half star ratings were available, Id give it 2.5 stars.",3,1

I came close to attempting to force the connection, but stopped short for fear of damaging the connector pins on both my iPad2 and iPod.    I would suggest that Amazon modify the product description to advise potential buyers that you need to use the cable that comes with the iPad2 to make use of the iCruiser.",3,2
It's okay,3,1
"This product is clearly a $30 Chinese ham radio handheld (Baofeng UV-5R) inside a desktop case. If you are a business user, you should verify that this is legal for your licensed frequencies.<br /><br />This product is excellent for government bureaucracies trying to discard left over budget at the end of the year.",3,1
"great sound, Slightly uncomfortable with extended use. Microphone didnt work, but not that much of an issue for me.",3,2
This map is not updated enough so it is not with good value.  I expected to find more details but they were not there.,3,2
"It is a lot longer than it needs to be, making it difficult to fit in the crowded under dash area.  The GM-1 comes with no wiring identifications.  The colors are different than the color codes for the vehicle.  I have looked all over and cannot find the color codes for the wires coming out of the GM-1.  It has 2 big red wires (I know where these go), white, white-red, white-black, & yellow black. It also could have been built with the remote plug connector on the output wires.  Then it would have been a plug and play for most vehicles.",3,1
Sounds great but still over priced,3,1
"A simple and effective package that gives you recharging capability virtually anywhere.  Don't expect it to withstand rough treatment or daily use -- it's not quite rugged enough for that. <br />Good value for money, great as a backup charger at home, in the car, in the suitcase/laptop bag.",3,1
"I just won't work... ugh!  I lost the charger for my new (gen 4?) shuffle and was hoping for an inexpensive replacement.  This won't work, so just save yourself the trouble and by an authentic apple charger.",3,2

"Worked well for a year, then failed.  Was well kept & still looks good, just does not function any longer.",3,1
It is ok!!,3,1
"Nice bright light, but the base is too big to make it nicely portable.  I bought it use as a portable light for my e-reader, but because the base is so big, it is hard to attach it to the e-reader case and have it stay nicely.",3,1
"eh, it was ok. but it doesn't really protect anything. when you take it off after it has been on for a while, you'll notice it scratches up your player anyway. I pretty much just bought it to add bulk to it, because it was always slipping out of my hand. get a rubber or silcone case, they are better.",3,2
"I like the length of the cable, and the heavy duty cord, but the plug fits into my iPad too loosely, and it keeps falling out during charging.",3,1
"I really, really liked this product...but after a few months the wire casing at the device connection split and stopped working.  I thought I had just been too hard on it and bought another because it worked so well.  The same thing happened after an even shorter period of time when I was careful to not abuse it!  Sad, best one I had found, maybe if I buy a 3rd I'll first reinforce it with duct tape.",3,2
"I ordered this unit because I was looking for a specific combination that apparently isn't made on the market much.  I wanted a portable DVD player that could be used by 1 person (with battery pack for mobility) but also for 2 in a car.  The Coby 7\\"" DVD player fit the bill, but had mixed reviews.  The RCA is close, but has no battery to maintain power during a trip.  I found this unit, but could not find a review on it.  For the price (and screen size), I figured I would try it out.    Physically, the units feel cheaper than other players (I had a Sony that broke). The buttons don't seem to be built to withstand too much usage, and there's no DVD menu controls on the main unit - you have to use the remote if you want to do more than start/stop the DVD.    That being said, the screens are nice, they play burned DVD's fine (another model of this had a complaint that didn't play +R's or RW's) and the main goal - having both kids watching the same movie from their car seats without craning their necks, has been attained.    Have only had the unit for a month so far, so no idea about the longevity.    p.s. The main player screen is slightly smaller than the monitor - odd.  Not sure why they don't use the same.    If a brand name company had made this configuration (RCA could have just had a battery), I would have bought it in a flash.  The fact that this is a relative unknown brand gave me pause.  I'd still feel more comfortable with a brand name for the quality.",3,2
"But its bulky, hard to use the camera.  The stylus that is included is junk.  I would have preferred the thinner fold only model.",3,1
not really any bass.<br /><br />I own and LOVE the non shallow mount 8&#34; inch skar.<br /><br />this was more of a mid than a sub.,3,1
"This case did not fit until I used foam material to pad the insides. The transparent plastic opening does a great job protecting the scratch prone <br />Zen display face. Now, with the proper foam spacers, the unit will not fall out when I open the case. I am happy with this case as long as there are no CUSTOM cases available.",3,1
The screen resolution and clarity when using a raspberry pi is nowhere near what is advertised.,3,1
Seemingly easy to follow installation but the cover is just a bit too large so I had a very hard time. Either the corners remain popped up or you have to shove the corners of the plastic into the frame. I wouldn't suggest the last part... it looks great but I have no idea how I'm going to get it off my kindle now.,3,1
I did not receive the correct product. I received a black one when I ordered pink. it works fine but as it was a birthday gift for my daughter I was not happy when I received the wrong one and had no time to do anything about it,3,2
I was not happy with the quality of this product. I purchased a Music Angel speaker a couple of years ago and was very pleased with that one. I thought I would like these but they had no base therefore sounded tinny.,3,1

"Good case, quality made. However the color is WAY off. Classic Brown? That depends on your perception but it clearly is not like the color pictured on this page. It's more of a... well... dull brown. Not that, that will help you (unless I call it poo brown which is quite accurate).   Other than the misleading color in the picture it's a great case but I don't know if I can put these on our Retail Store employee ipads for that reason.",3,1
"This isn't a review about the functionality or reliability of the INA-W900, per se, that's been covered in many other reviews here.  I will say that I like most things about the receiver but there are some annoying things as well:<br />- MANY many button presses to do anything with the NAV unit; I've counted ten or so to simply go to a POI in your address book<br />- The iPod navigation is a pain.  To go to a new album of the same artist you're listening to, you have to do a search all the way from the beginning.  If you have over 100GB of music on your iPod like I do, it's a pain.  Only when you've done that can you then go up a folder.  Once you turn off the vehicle, you have to start all over.  Also, most of the time the song you were playing picks up where you left off before turning the vehicle off, but sometimes it doesn't and instead starts with the first alphabetical song in your iPod.<br /><br />OK, so as previously mentioned, this post is really to help those who want to update the firmware (software) on their unit:<br />1. Go to alpine-usa.com and click \\""Support,\\"" then \\""Find an Owner's Manual\\""<br />2. In the \\""Enter your model number to search\\"" enter \\""INA-W900\\"", then click \\""Submit\\""<br />3. Under \\""Search Results\\"" click \\""Software Update\\"" and choose Save File (Firefox)<br />4. Find the file and double click the EXE (W900_V1001000.EXE) to extract it; extract it to its own subfolder so all the files will be together (especially helpful if you have a bunch of files in your root Downloads folder like I do)<br />5. Copy all of the extracted files AND the aforementioned EXE to an SD card; after copying, there should be the following files and one folder:<br />--  1. $FileList.txt<br />--  2. $md5.bin<br />--  3. AppVer.txt<br />--  4. INA-W900-SEUpdate_110510v2.pdf<br />--  5. PocketMap_PMD_W900_1014_NA_25_40.CAB<br />--  6. W900_V1001000.EXE (I don't think you really need this in here but that's what the instructions indicated)<br />--  7. A \\""W900\\"" subfolder withfour files in it:<br />----  7a. chain.bin<br />----  7b. chain.lst<br />----  7c. NK.bin<br />----  7d. TINYNK.bin<br />6. On the INA-W900 in your vehicle, press the Eject key to tilt the screen out of the way; pry open the cover to the SD slot and insert your SD card; press the SD cover back into place and close the display panel<br />7. Press the NAVI hard key to bring up the NAV menu<br />8. Press the Setup icon (the wrench)<br />9. Press the down arrow to go to the second screen and press \\""Update\\""<br />10. Acknowledge the update confirmation and it will start<br />11. The firmware will update but it will throw you back on a different screen (your original audio source in my case) while it's running (a little disconcerting); keep pressing the hard NAVI key to view your progress if you're curious<br />12. Mine took about ten minutes or so; you'll eventually get a \\""Navigation Update Successful\\"" message; press OK to continue.<br /><br />The PDF (INA-W900-SEUpdate_110510v2.pdf) covers these steps in decent detail.  If you're like me, however, you might not have seen that when you extracted the files because you didn't do so in its own subfolder (like me, initially).  I thought the only files extracted were the W900 folder and the four files within that.  Whoever wrote the extraction utility should have added a subfolder in there, like WinZip or WinRAR does for you automatically.<br /><br />Note: this is NOT a map update**, nor does it really address any other functionality of the unit besides the NAV.  Those expecting it to resolve the laundry list of annoying behavior will probably be disappointed.  According to the PDF that's included in the EXE you download, the update does the following:<br />- Enhanced GPS free detection and recovery mechanism<br />- Improved NAVI OS recovery in Registry corruption<br />- Improved UI for single digit odd number address entry<br />- Voice Guidance correction<br />- CSR update for Memory map error and Titan L2 cache<br /><br />**THERE IS A MAP UPDATE AVAILABLE FOR THIS UNIT!  Just do a google search for \\""NVD-W901 MAP Update\\"" and you'll see it on alpine-usa.com - it runs $99 and comes on a 4GB SD card.",3,1
"I was so sad when I learned that only ONE of the ports worked.  It was shipped in a timely manner, but I didn't use it for a while so I didn't return it.  It's still nice to have the single port.",3,2

"Pros: This skin *looks* good. I was specifically looking for a bright red to help me not lose the iPad, and this accomplishes that. It gives an almost neon tube effect at the edges when it's backlit, a look I love. Fingerprints aren't particularly visible and dirt doesn't seem to stick to it much. I also like that it's transparent, so I can slip black-and-white artwork between it and the iPad's back for an even more distinctive look. Finally, it has a pleasant overall feel, making the iPad easier to hold and prop up than a naked iPad.<br /><br />Cons: Quality is mediocre. There are rough mold joins around the whole perimeter and each cutout that are mildly irritating to the fingers. It's not quite tight enough, so it often slips off a bit, especially next to the home button. The covers for the volume control and power switches are poorly distinguished by texture, making it hard to find them without looking.<br /><br />I also own a plain, mostly clear but slightly taupey-grayish Scosche \\""glosSEE\\"" skin [...]. It is fantastic quality in all the ways this one is not -- smooth edges, perfect fit, perfect differentiation on the switches. It's also very slightly harder and slicker, but just as easy to hold. However, I think it's ugly -- it's definitely not neutral or crystal-clear, and it's aged quickly in the year I've had it, looking dingy and smeary. I don't really like using it in a professional setting. If the Scosche was available in bright red, I'd probably get one anyway, but it isn't.",3,1
This box looks to be strong and really impressive.  But as we all know looks are not everything.  I found this box to hit pretty hard but I would not put it in the same category as a probox.  Altho ugh it does look like one. My biggest issue is the fact the back piece of wood that is used directly behind the sub is only 1/4 of an inch there by causing your subs to rattle and sound not so good when it is cranked up. To solve this problem I cut out the 1/4 inch piece and put a 1/2 inch piece of mdf on it and sealed the with caulk. Then I re sprayed with bed liner spray and now it sounds amazing.  I think the product is good but could be better.  If they would put half inch mdf instead of quarter inch. It makes all the difference in the world. I would buy product again but next time I would just know to replace that piece on both sides before installing.,3,2
The cord is too flimsy,3,2
"This is the second purchase of this product as the first worked for a week and then died.<br />The product was initially installed for use with my iPhone 4 which worked GREAT!<br />HOWEVER upon upgrading the iPhone to ios 6, there is now limited functionality with Bluetooth, you can no longer control the songs from the screen, there is no display for song title, the only way to control what's playing from the phone! Steering wheel controls are now useless and calls via bluetooth are a joke.  I did call Pioneer customer support, who can only tell me they are working on it, but have no date for a solution. When/if one is found then only if you have registered the product will you be notified, and you will need to update the unit via SD Card. This isn't the most expensive product on the market, but still for the price and the fact that ios6 has been in the works for how long, it is disappointing to say the least.",3,2
Like the title says not a Lynx but still decent for the price it is packaged in a lunatik box and looks like one. Even though you would think it was from a distance. This is a cheap chinese knok off. The only metal parts are the caseing that holds the nano which is aluminum. And the clasp is aluminum as well but really thin aluminum. Oh and the screwa that hold the case to the band together. The band feels plastic. All that being said for the price of around i think $20 there are alot of better options and alot of worse options. I gave it 3 stars not because it is a knock from China but because I dont see the band making it for more than a 6 month period before braking or the screws comming out of the case. All in all not bad but I will be ordering a real lunatik lynx.,3,2
It's ok for the money. It works fine.  Doesn't have the clarity my last one had. Fits well under the seat.,3,1

Mind you the XT is the faster 10Hz version, so it may be ok for some, but 10Hz was too fast for my application, so they should have checked with me first, which they sure didn't.<br />So I'll echo the other comment: be careful, they have no qualms shipping you something else than what you ordered.<br /><br />The GPS is likely 4 stars, for its inability to let you reprogram the speed of the 10Hz button (you can only reprogram the 1Hz button to a faster speed when I'd have needed the exact opposite), and 2 stars for DBROTH.",3,1

"The wall charger doesn't charge my iPhone 3G. The phone shows the charging screen for about a minute then goes back to the usual screen not charging/no external power connected.

My iPhone is recognized but when syncing i get a \\""time out\\"" error message.<br />Car charger and rollup cable is a great combination. No tangling wires neither while connected nor when disconnected. For the price the car charger and the 2 charging cables are worth the purchase of the set in my opinion. I can put the wall-USB adapter to use with other USB powered accessories without a problem.",3,1
I really like the product but I only gave 3 stars because I got something different then the picture showed. My case is a 2 piece case not a 1 piece like the picture shows. Good product and price but not what I wanted,3,2

"In the last 15 years, I've only used Wet VHS Cleaners. In comparison to 2 other Wet Cleaner brands I have at home, Maxell did the worst job. It cleaned the Head, but I had to re-use this Cleaner too frequently. The duration between cleanings was annoying & irritating.<br /><br />We were able to view 1 VHS Tape, directly after Cleaning. But, in order to watch another movie, I had to Chean the Head again, which was much too soon. In the past, after using other Wet VHS Head Cleaners, we were able to view at least 6 or 7 movies, in-between cleanings. Therefore, something is defective, either the solution, or the Cleaner Tape.<br /><br />To test this product, we wanted to see if we could view at least 1 more movie, without any problems. Therefore, I used the VHS Tape, but replaced the solution with rubbing alcohol. Believe it or not, it worked. We watched a second movie, and my VHS movie tape was not destroyed, because I've used it several times after this procedure.<br /><br />Conclusion: I'm going to try the Dry VHS Head Cleaners in the future. When desperate for a movie in the mean-time, I'll repeat the same procedure, using my own solution. When you have 1 day off and just want to chill, viewing a movie always helps. But, I am looking into researching the Dry VHS Head Cleaners to compare the performance.",3,2

Inexpensive media device. Still has small software issues like it will not search or sort songs by any value. I ended up putting 31GB of songs in one folder and used random repeat to play them.  The battery lasts a little over a day with constant use. The FM radio is an added plus!  It is very difficult to find any firmware updates or other technical information on this product. Maybe learning how to read logograms would help since this is a very Chinese knockoff?,3,2
Works fine however I must increase the volume greatly compared to radio play.,3,1
It is OK box - but I guess you get what you pay for. Do not compare to Bose.,3,2
"There is no problem with the function, but you do not know if it is charging. No light.",3,2
This player is OK.  I live in a rural area that is near a metropolitan area though.  Because of this there is more bleed through than works well with this player.  And unfortunately you're limited to the preset stations.,3,1

I was expecting at least 5 miles range in urban areas, but seemed like it's more like 2-3 miles range.<br /><br />Used it for a family trip in the mountains where we had multiple cars following each other and no cell phone reception, works good for that purpose.",3,1
When buying this item the one thing we all have to realize is that this transmitter  is only 2 or 4 bucks or so what else could you really expect for such  a cheap item. This Transmitter lasted me quiet some time the charger  went out first after about 5 months of having it then the darn thing  died. It sucks but honestly im just gonna buy another one   i once went to best buy and spent 30 bucks on a garkin brand one   and that broke to its ineveitable either go cheap and have wishful thinking  or cash out and have wishful thinking either way  your not paying much for it so   DEAL :),3,2
The range of these radios as advertised must be in the desert with no obstructions around.  The main reason for the purchase was to communicate between two vehicles and to act as an intercom between two buildings that are about 600 ft apart.  The ability to communicate is marginal at the very best.  I own a couple of other devices marketed by Dakota Alert and have been happy with their performance but am not overly impressed with the radios.,3,1

"I normally don't leave reviews, but felt obligated because of the broad range of prices for similar products. I thought, \\""Lets see what I get for 11 bucks.\\"" Fist off, the products works AND was shipped to me in 4 days flat! I had my doubts, especially because of the price. Sure it could be better ... and looks like something that came out of Doc Browns Delorean ... but I was not going to spend $99 dollars for what might turn out to be just a phone holder. The only real downside is the hands free phone option. The sound is not loud enough so it's hard to hear the calls, but I was told I sounded fine on the other end. It holds the phone fine and can be configured many ways. The FM transmitter works well for my itunes and even Pandora. Unfortunitly you have to reset the station each time you start your car.  God, I spent more the my iPhone 4 case from Verizon  - it was $30 bucks! P.S. Apple, if you are listening - built a car holder for your iPhone.",3,1
"I got the unit and had NO REMOTE and also didn't have the Antenna adapter and  YES THE UNIT IS DIFFERENT THEN PICTURED.

The steering wheel controls didn't with right. Tried to program it and only thing that worked was the volume. It didn't read the SOURCE button or buttons to skip song forward or backNO AUDIO OUTPUTS to add a amp yet the picture on the radio its self said that it does.it only has inputs.

"When I bought my first iPod (the [[ASIN:B000RM7SQK Apple 4GB iPod Nano  Second Generation iPod Nano]]-- who could resist that slim elegance?) I had already heard about the problem with scratches that surfaced as soon as the first Nano met the first pocket full of keys and change.  So I went out to look for a protector.  This is what I brought back.<br /><br />It's useful if not stunning.  The opening at the top front has to be stretched out to stuff the Nano into it.  After the Nano is in place the skin snaps back.  The silicon material it is made from does obscure the gleam of the Nano but I think it would be really hard to puncture or tear, at least I haven't managed to do so with some pretty hard use.<br /><br />Of course this is not the case my Nano is in now because, let's face it-- it is functional but not particularly elegant or attractive and there are a number of better choices out there.",3,2

"The Magicfly system works great- when it works. The first issue is the included batteries in the key fobs. Mine lasted three months with minor usage. So I switched out the battery with the remaining three that were supplied, and they were nearly dead too. So the supplied batteries are cheap, but what can you expect for the price? Now, six months after purchase, the beeper in the unit I'm using has failed. But I got four units, so on to the next one. I will say the beeper is plenty loud when it has a fresh battery.",3,1
I was a little disappointed when I received this product.  It was a cheap armband for carrying your ipod device.  I ordered 4 to give them to my children to use when they run or walk for exercise. That is why I bought it so use while I walk.  So far it is holding up but not sure for how long. I thought it would hold a MP3 player as well but it is a little tight for that.,3,1
"With other protectors costing 3x as much this is a great value.

"My first impression of this product was, ok it looks good and quality/workmanship was great. The ISO9001 label seems to claim it's a quality product from China? To initially verify its operating correctly I performed a \\""bench test\\"" of the product to assure its ok. Saves time removing a bad unit from the vehicle.<br /><br />User Manual:<br />The user manual is quite difficult to follow it's instructions  as it's created in China. Recomend it be read over prior to operating the unit.<br />Camera:<br />The camera will require connecting to the backup light only. It is wireless and performance may vary on distance and metal interfrerence of the transmitter.  It provides a clear color picture. Fieid of view is good but the multi color range lines are only useful to determine proximity of an object to your bumper  at 1 foot away or less. Wireless transmission to the Mirror was not evualuated  distance is supposed to be 10 meters. The camera has two LEDs Light emmiting diode elements. They are ideal for at night as a supplement to the backup lights and assist in backup. I believe they perform better than IR Infra red detectors.<br />Bluetooth:<br />The bluetooth pairs quickly and the instructions are vague about the features provided. It paired with the Iphone4 but the Caller ID display program is partly readable at to a name needs work by the manufacturer.  The Microphone and the speaker are very good and provide clear crisp audio . Hands free caaling  works very good and it uses SIRI to make calls via the bluetooth link. The Multifunction button answers calls and is used to place calls.<br />FM & Music:<br />I did not install a MMC card with music but the FM feature can Play music via your FM radio. When set to FM you can also use your radio to listen to calls when tuned to the selected frequency. I only tested  the Bluetooths connection to the car radio.<br />Mirror:<br />The mirror is somewhat heavy and requires it  be clippd to your original mirror. Power is hardwiredto the ignition.

"I bought this based on the good reviews on Amazon.  All the electronics worked like a charm.  However, the sound of the music coming out of these little speakers was not what I am used to like the Model 88CD.  I sounded rather hollow.  But comparable to the Bose table radios. It's a good buy for all the connections one can have and at half the price of a Bose.",3,1
"Intentionally poor documentation.  I think they are trying to force you to use professionaly installer.  A lot of subjects are not covered but you can figure things out without much trouble.  It does not cover installation of the antenna, light, valet switch combined unit which is included in the kit.  It is easy to figure out since it is color coded and there is only one way to install it.  It is not even shown on the packing list.  Any of the other add-on modules (proximity sensor) you are on your own.  You can kind of figure those out also unless you are using more than one add on module.  In that case you have to cut into the devices wiring harnesses and install a diode which is not included.  Don't expect help from the Viper web site.  I would be reluctant to try something like the starter disable, which the unit is capable of doing, without much better instructions.<br /><br />ON the plus side it does work very well.",3,2
"It's very difficult to find an MP3, CD, CDR boombox stereo player these days since most people use more modern devices.  I looked at my local Frys, Best Buy, etc., and only Amazon had one that wasn't too flimsy, plastic and ugly.  I am replacing a really nice, compact and good looking Sharper Image shower boombox that cost three times as much, and it isn't as good quality, but it does play MP3s and the Sharper Image boombox didn't.  Since I like audio books from Europe and my local library, this does the job and I'm glad it exists.  I'm normally leary of something this cheap, but so far so good!  (One slight problem though, I can't seem to locate the on off button!  I have to use the plug.)  Also, I could care less about the crummy radio",3,1
"Well, first of all, this item is cheap in price and also in quality.  I cannot believe this is real leather, the interior partition certainly is not.  The light is effective but a little bulky.  The reader is held securely in a frame of the same synthetic material with a fold in flap at the top.  There is an elastic loop for the stylus.  The article was shipped very quickly and was received within 10 days.  Really for the price along with free shipping this is a pretty good deal.  If you are expecting a well made, real Nappa leather case think again and be prepared to pay a lot more.",3,1

"There are good and bad points to this speaker.<br /><br />GOOD:<br /><br />The speaker looks nice and is perfect for sitting on a wooden desk<br />The device pairs up to Bluetooth devices easily<br />Sound quality is perfect for talk<br /><br />BAD:<br /><br />Not great for music, lack of bass and distortion at high volumes<br /><br />I really do like the way this speaker looks, it is a shame that the audio quality overall isn't great.  I'm a self-professed audio snob and I don't think I'd be happy listening to any types of music on this device due to the lack of bass.  I tested it out watching a few baseball games and listening to talk radio and the speaker works great for that purpose.<br /><br />The bottom line is it all depends what you want to use this speaker for, if it's music you might not be happy but if you're looking for a way to listen to podcasts or other talk-based programming you might love it.<br /><br />Sample provided for review.",3,1

It's a little annoying trying to get sd cards out of the sd card holders, but I don't mind it too much.<br />This is a great product for people who don't want to put anything in the elastic pocket.

It was very protective without being too bulky, the \\""kick-stand\\"" feature was great, and I loved the way the magnetic closure clicked shut.  HOWEVER, after I'd used this case for a few weeks, my iPod Touch began to behave strangely.  I would get odd bars on the screen, it would lock up and/or refuse to turn off, etc.  This happened several times before I began to suspect that the magnet in the case was somehow causing this problem.  I removed the iPod from the case, and haven't had any problems since (this was several months ago).",3,2

"After using my first original pair of Shure flange sleeves, I was hooked. The upsides to these original ones were the quality and durability of the sleeves. Wonderful as they might be, a major downside in purchasing straight from Shure is the price tag. And I was hoping the product reviewed here was going to solve that predicament for me.  I was thrilled when I received the UPS package containing the knock-off sleeves. I opened up the box and teared the transparent package holding the sleeves together. I took a single sleeve out and attempted to attach it to my Shure earphones, but something was not right. As it turns out, the diameter of the sleeve opening is larger than the diameter of the Shure earphone shaft. This would prove impractical because my earphones would not be able to stay put as I listened to my favorite tunes while riding the BART to and from San Francisco.  Frustrated, I decided to return the flange sleeves. But that is when I realized I had made another poor purchase several weeks prior. Don't get me wrong, the Monster Super Tips Sample Pack (sounds like something you order at Chevy's) on paper sounds like an enticing proposition. You get a plethora of sleeves for a cheap price. But, they were not comfortable plugged inside my ear, much less if I were to use them for long periods of time. I digress!  Within the Monster Super Tips Sample Pack comes a unique item called according to Monster, Tiny Eartip Adapters. With these installed on the shaft of my trusty Shure earphones (think condom with the tip missing), I was able to functionally use the flange sleeves purchased through Amazon. I could have, potentially, wrapped tape around the shaft but that would have been tricky and maybe would have come out wrong.  To conclude, I recommend (albeit not highly) these flange sleeves for the price alone. And, if you are so inclined to wrap some tape, or if you are \\""lucky\\"" like me, attach a Tiny Eartip Adapter from Monster to each earphone, you will be able to show off your flange sleeves to all of your friends. Or, you can be envied by those around you while you jam to your favorite music band while you walk, jog, or run around Lake Merritt!   With that said, i will give this product for the reason mentioned above, a 3 out of 5 stars rating.",3,1

"The installation was as much of a pain as I thought it would be but any DVD Player would be the same.  It went into the roof of my Toyota Tacoma without much trouble.  The wiring is just the right length to leave the RCA connectors under the driver's seat.  I required an \\""add-a-circuit\\"" fuse holder and about 10' of wire to power the unit.  I could not properly wire the dome light for the Toyota because it's wired live and the dvd player expects it to be the other way.  I need a relay or some rewiring.  This is a hassle, but not too bad.  The good:  The thing keeps the kids happy.  It plays all our DVD's so far (including overseas ones we got in India, Thailand and China).  The bad:  The remote is really cheap and all the buttons are identical.  Good luck finding the right button in the dark.  The thing doesn't remember any settings when powered off.  You have to keep choosing \\""FM-89.1\\"" or or \\""IR Headphones\\"" whatever you want over and over again. And the menu system is typically chinese.  This is no Apple device.  The IR wireless headphones only sometimes work. We are using [[ASIN:B0015C3UB8 Sound Storm Laboratories SHP Stereo Headphones]].  They also get interference from mobile phones in the car.  That ticking noise. While driving along, I see the kids leaning to the center like lovebirds trying to get the headphones to give a clear signal.  There is no headphone jack.  So if you wanted to use wired headphones, you can't.  There isn't an easy way to use the AUX-in jack on the car stereo for sound.  I'm stuck with FM mode, and that works for about an hour until you run across a station that interferes with the channel you've picked.  On FM, the sound volume is really weak.  I have to CRANK up the volume on the car stereo to get it to play.  Guess what happens when I forget to turn it back down after we stop?  The local station or static VERY LOUD.  Summary:  What would I do differently?  I might look for a better interface.  I might try some models in a store to seethe interface before I buy.  I might just use an ipad hanging between the seats with some headphone splitters.  This things just feels cheap and I suspect it will break in a year or two.  I will not replace it when it does.",3,2
"Update:  Worked ok for almost 2 months! Now there's something rattling inside the unit, and when plugged into my iPhone 4S, it doesn't charge! Purchased this on 4/19/15 and now, 6/16/15, it's broken!  For the price (vs buying the more expensive LIfeproof extender) for my iPhone Lifeproof case, it works fine. The extender isn't as long as the Lifeproof extender, but still works. You just have to be extra careful in pulling it out, since you don't have as much grabbing surface as Lifeproof extender. These past 2 months I've been very careful when pulling out this extender. Don't know what's broken inside, but it doesn't work now. Anyone know who to complain to, or get a replacement from? I've never returned anything through Amazon, so if anyone knows how I do this, please lemme know.",3,2
"Edit: mine started charging again (not sure why it ever stopped), and so, because of the excellent radio and good sound quality, I'm bumping this to 3 stars.<br /><br />This is my review for the [[ASIN:B00RJW5U02 green 16GB version]], which is identical to this aside from the color and the micro SD card size. If you do buy one, look at the various colors and 16GB vs 8GB offerings to see what your best pricing option is that day - they fluctuate.<br /><br />I wanted to like this. I too owned the iPod nano this is so clearly meant to replicate. I was offered a free sample for evaluation, and I was excited to get it. I've spent many weeks trying to decide if I should evaluate it, but I've been pushed to do so by Charles Spanky's brave 1-star review (on the green 16GB version) as well as my brother's much higher four-star rating (likewise, for that color). Plus... I'm just tired of the need to review it hanging over my head.<br /><br />So... why two stars instead of the one that Charles gave?<br /><br />Because this item does have some nice aspects to it. You get a 16GB micro SD card, a mini USB cable (useful for 15 year old devices you find in drawers, perhaps), earbuds (low quality, but serviceable), and a fun little puzzle (&#34;how to I get this darned thing to work?&#34;). You also get a surprisingly decent audio recorder and an FM radio that actually sounds fantastic with better headphones plugged in. Music sounds really good as well. I mean, truly, genuinely good. I wasn't expecting that.<br /><br />So, why two stars instead of the four my brother gave?<br /><br />Because I fear that rating it higher would kill the little that remains of my soul. This just isn't, in my opinion, a four star device, even at $25. Maybe it's worth half that... maybe it's a four-star $12.50 device, because then you could part it out upon its death and recoup your expenses. Maybe.<br /><br />But... look, I love tech. I love love love love tech. I have more phones than fingers. I get giddy around anything mechanical or that consumes (or generates) power. I'm excited by this sort of stuff usually, even the low-end things. But I just cannot stand this one. The button-circle-control thingy is *horribly* inaccurate/laggy/inconsistent. The movie player only plays movie formats that no one living has except maybe on a PC from 1994 somewhere in their basement. Ebooks? Um, no. Even if you could manage to get one on-screen, the control pad would make reading it unbearable. Music plays great... but the 1999 folder scheme has been out of date since the first iPod and is - again - near useless when using the control pad to navigate it.<br /><br />Worst of all: the thing died on me. I let it run out of charge, and now it cannot be used when not plugged in. It simply will not hold a charge for even a second's worth of playing - it's like there is no battery at all. I've tried charging at 500mA, at 1A, and at 2A. Nothing. So, as little as this was worth as a $25 device, it's worth less as a $25-plus-external-battery device.<br /><br />If it played movies in formats known to modern humans, I'd rate it higher. If the directory structure made finding music easier, I'd rate it higher. If the control pad worked well, or if it used micro USB, or if it didn't die after going uncharged for a few days, or if it came with a 64GB micro SD card, I'd rate it higher. As it is, I just can't.<br /><br />You want something better? New prepaid cellphones are often near this price and will perform so much better. Not long ago, the nice-for-the-price now-discontinued [[ASIN:B00E45043A Nokia 520]] was $20. The fantastic [[ASIN:B00HPP3QD6 Moto G]] has been as low as $25. I own both of these, and they ABSOLUTELY BLOW THIS OUT OF THE WATER and can do everything this can (except the Moto G doesn't use a micro SD card).<br /><br />Look around at prepaid cellphones. They are cheap, and many will do everything this does and more. Buy one of them instead...<br /><br />...unless you like much frustration and occasional intermittent joy. If that's you, buy this. The form factor also works for spreading garlic butter on bread, so there's that.butter on bread, so there's that.",3,1
i bought this in fear of other reviews and when i got it i tested it and it passes all but the quality of sound make it kinda feel like music in a long hallway but i think (i think) so im not 100 percent sure it might be the head phones so yes its worth the quick also to ease your fear it is fulfilled by amazon prime shipping and a return policy guaranteed ...so if you want cheap get cheap it rly doesnt kill........like apple products they do kill there so bad ...oh right ..buy it,3,2
"This was the first skin that I've ever ordered from Dacalrus, so I've gotten used to different materials. Prior to buying this one, I had purchased skins with vinyl, so they had more of a faux-leather texture to them, which I liked. It felt durable, and lasted quite a long time.<br /><br />With this skin, the material is a glossy finish without texture, which isn't bad. It's still thick enough to provide a feeling of protection, but it lacks the texture of vinyl, so it's not as \\""grippy\\"" as ones I'd had before. Still, not a big deal.<br /><br />Things I like:<br />1) The picture is true to advertised. The colors pop, and it does cover my Nook Color very well.<br /><br />2) Though I was a BIT torn as to whether or not I liked it, the application aspect was actually something I ended up liking. The decals comes attached to not just their sticker backing, but also have an applicator 'tape' on top of that. So you first have to peel the decal AND applicator tape off the backing, put both of those on the device, then peel off the applicator tape to get the decal on.<br /><br />Though it sounds complicated, having the applicator tape does help to keep the process straight, so you can lay down the skin in one piece without having to work around awkward pieces that are weird shapes. (The front of the Nook has longer strips, which can be awkward to place without overlapping the edges or looking sloppy, since they never seem to go on evenly.) It also was nice for the front application, because the small bar with the 'N' key can be awkward, but with the tape, just meant you lay the entire thing down at the same time as the outer edges, which saved time.<br /><br />The applicator tape was a bit awkward with the front screen, since it was also sticky and stuck to the screen before pulling off. It was also a bit awkward trying to line up the decal through the applicator tape, because the tape isn't entirely clear; it's more of a frosted look, which makes getting exact edges a bit frustrating.<br /><br />Still, it did simply the process of applying the front piece, which I did like.<br /><br />3) The durability has been great. The texture isn't quite grippy as the vinyl I've had before, but the corners seem to stay on better, and overall, I haven't had any issues with it wearing earlier than it should have.<br /><br />Things I don't like:<br />1) The cut fits the Nook but not as closely as other products I've had for skins. It's not really a huge deal, but the back speakers aren't cut exactly for it, and the microSD card flap doesn't have it's own cover, which seems small, but makes a nice difference in the look of the skin.<br /><br />2) The skin can be rather sensitive to pressure from outside sources. I've put this in my purse or backpack a few times, and the skin ends up taking on the shape of some things beneath it, like wire binders, pens, or stitches. It hasn't worn it down or anything, but it is visible when that happens, which would not have happened, had the material been a bit thicker or textured.<br /><br />Overall, not bad. It's not that expensive, and the application is different, but makes things more convenient. Still, I do wish it was a bit more textured, grippy, or more durable overall that way. Like it, but don't love it. It was also more costly than the vinyl ones I'd purchased, and I'm honestly not convinced that increase in price was worth it.rustrating.<br /><br />Still, it did simply the process of applying the front piece, which I did like.<br /><br />3) The durability has been great.

Shippment was pretty fast. The headphone are comfortable on the ears but never stayed on my head real good. They are OK for a novice walker which I was when I purchased them. I got about 4 or 5 different stations. Sound quality is just ok but then again I didn't spend a whole lot on these. You get what you pay for. I since have replaced them with a really good sounding head set that I love.,3,1
"The case is actually nice, it's strong, and makes my ipad feel durable so I'm not afraid to use it around the office now. The only thing I wasn't happy with is how it's misrepresented on here, the \\""onyx\\"" case is actually much darker than depicted in the photos, so it's basically completely black when I was expecting a more charcoal color with visible wood grain. Still, it's a nice case, just don't expect the color depicted.",3,1
"My unit suffers from a reliability issues. Sometimes when I turn it on, it comes up completely mute, not even key beep. No switching on/off, shaking, hitting, or battery removal would fix it. The radio comes around and works fine if I leave it alone for a day or two. This happens very rarely, but I cannot depend on it, so I just carry it for some emergency.    There was a couple of small disappointments too. One, the 8.33 kHz spacing is only for receive. Two, it's poorly compatible with my David Clark H10-13S headset: very quiet. The UI is as confusing as everyone says.    When it works, it works though. It's rugged construction, quality built handheld, which could be really nice to someone. Didn't work too well for me, sadly. I now wish I bought ICOM A14 instead, but I went cheap. I use AA batteries and the adapter for A14 went for $60 or some such ridiculous amount. Adapter for Vertex I got for $20.    Edit 2011-08-11: I traced the issue with the sound to the intermittent contact between the speaker and the mainboard. After I bent the little sprung leafs with needle-nose pliers, everything works reliably.",3,2
I had high hopes...... But then again I was comparing it a w6 that I used to have. Not much space in my current commuter so I thought that this sub would be a choice for the price.

Still, for $20 bucks it's a damned useful bundle and if you have a PS2 (or similar mp3 player) I recommend it.",3,1
"I bought this so I would have a convenient way to carry my Walkman while exercising... when worn on the arm, if you sweat much while exercising, the moisture tends to get inside of the rubber coating.

Not a body builder, just chubby.. but my arms are not really that unusually large.    If you are a smaller person and don't sweat much, I think it is a pretty decent purchase.

Also advertised to come with an SD cardr, which it didn't. And it came with like...7 extra batteries... Amazon totally refunded me the price of the same card so I could buy one though! Thanks, Amazon!",3,1
I like the skin portion of this product but the belt clip is this awful bright white color that looks cheap and clashes with just about everything that I own.  This package comes with a sports belt but no directions on how to attach it to the skin.  Very frustrating when even an engineer can't even figure it out.  I would suggest maybe just purchasing a skin directly from Sandisk to be completely satisfied.,3,2
I purchased this holder to use in my new Porsche Cayman S several years back.  I work just as advertised and proved handy on long trips.,3,1
was broken when I got it..was not the sellers fault...the ones who are building this<br />is very cheaply made...I fixed it and it does not perform like it should...,3,2
This cover is suitable but not as nice as the Moko covers we bought for the Kindle Paperwhites.  Still it works as advertised.,3,1
"I purchased this to place on my iHome dock. I recently purchased a new iPhone, and wanted to be able to put it on the dock without removing my silicon-style case. While this item worked, the phone was really too heavy for it. I felt that it put too much stress/weight on the extension, so I made sure that I put the dock in a place where the phone could lean against the wall.   In the end, the extension lasted three days before I finally broke it. It was a good idea, just not practical for what I needed it for. I take full responsibility, but felt I should warn others who might have the same idea.   There are models that come with a support for the phone, but for now I think I will just partially remove the case and set it on the existing dock. It's cumbersome, but a safer and cheaper option.",3,2
wires are too short,3,1
It broke around the volume area just putting it on. Not a bad cover but not a great one!,3,2
It's a lovely little device.  I wish it had come with directions because as I was experimenting with it I dropped it and broke a small piece of plastic off. I wasn't sure if it had a release button to open the holder portion. The phone fits into the holder well and the holder sticks well to the window.  The location in my Kia Sorrento's front windsheild did not work out so well for me.  Still experimenting.,3,1
"I bought this stereo for my bedroom because I enjoy listening to my CD's as I drift off to sleep. Problem is, I have the volume low and the electronic buzz from the workings of the unit transfers through the speakers and is as loud as the music. I ended up giving it to my daughter who is glad to use it at higher volumes where the buzz is not as noticeable.<br />The unit is also very light. This is good except when you wish to press one of the buttons on the face. The effort to push the button in is higher than the effort to move the unit so you end up pushing until it either falls off the table or you grab it with your other hand and hold it while working the button. Sticky rubber feet would probably fix that issue.<br />Otherwise, the MAG-MS857 works decently for the price. The on/off and volume are conveniently located on the top of the unit and the tuner dial works freely and is sensitive enough to pick up some hard to dial in stations.<br />It plays most CD's, whether store bought or burned off your computer and has an input for any type of MP3 player which is a nice feature. The clock is your basic digital clock. I read some reviews panning the clock, but it seemed to work fine and I had no issue with it.<br />All in all, for the price it is a good buy but I would not recommend it for listening to quiet music at low volumes.",3,2
The screen came in 2 pieces. The mechanism that attaches the screen to the stand was broken. The broken piece was in the box when I opened it. The distributing company was contacted through Amazon and sent a replacement. The screen is now repaired and ready to go.,3,2

"This Review is for: Rocksteady XS<br />Printed Inside Battery Compartment:<br />Killer Concepts LLC<br />Part # VG2150-BT<br />FCC ID: PEU JH-MAUK2BT<br />CE: BST12070409Y-1EC-1<br />5V-5.3V battery and charger only.<br /><br />My Needs: I spend a lot of time at desks; A variety of desks in a variety of places. I also exercise with a portable exercise system in a variety of tight places and there is almost never a sound system available. There are some talk radio shows I would like to listen to when there are opportunities to do so (and a bit of music is nice now and then, too). I found an app that lets me download and listen to the shows from my phone whenever I want, so that left me the final issue of ear-buds or speakers.  Ear-buds are fine for times when I don't need to interact with other people and I use them a lot. However, there are times when I need to be able to hear what is going on around me (and I hate exercising with stuff in my ears or on my head and cables everywhere and sweat on my phone... bleh) and so I went in search of a small speaker package that I could easily carry around along with my usual laptop portable workstation accessories (keyboard, mouse, router, USB kits, wormhole cable, mini-flashlight, etc).<br /><br />Having a wired option for my devices with 3.5 audio outputs was a no-brainer (I use this with a variety of laptops, too).<br /><br />It needed to be loud enough to cover the area of several standard-sized cubicles at one time.<br /><br />It needed to be small enough to fit into my kit.<br /><br />It needed to be fast to setup and break down with few parts to get confused with all my other stuff.<br /><br />Battery life was not important because I am plugged in all the time.<br /><br />Bluetooth was not originally on my list of requirements, but I have some tasks that require me to constantly zip between several workstations, so taking my phone with me and not being connected with wires to the speakers seemed like a good plan.  Plus, it might be kind of fun to put the speaker in the middle of a dinner table and have several people chat to a distant relative on a phone call, right?<br /><br />Cost: I couldn't stomach the idea of spending $200 on anything like this. I know what $200 can buy and I'd rather carry around a big, clunky NICE set of $200 quasi-portable, powered desktop speakers than pay that much for a little thing that would not put out near the quality of sound that I could get otherwise. Thus, I waited. And waited some more. About 9 months after I started looking, I saw a daily-bargain deal-of-the-day type-of-thing from a friendly website and not only was this item not $200, but it wasn't even $100!<br /><br />___________________________<br /><br />How it filled my needs:<br /><br />Listening to Talk Radio can be grating on the ears with most small speakers.  I knew this in advance and went out and got a very good APP for my phone that lets me tweak everything (Bass, Treble, etc) and then save presets. I made a preset for spoken word (talk radio, audio books). With that and the default presets that came set up with the APP (classical music, modern rock, folk,etc),  this speaker performs wonderfully. Without that APP running, everything that goes from my phone through the speaker does not sound as good and some of the stuff is just bad. I blame that on the device and not the speaker.<br /><br />The 3.5 audio jack connection is well made and has handled several months worth of daily plugging and unplugging (as has the power connection). The provided cables are not the highest quality, but they work fine. There is no static hiss or other background garbage. It is a solid, good sounding connection.<br /><br />The volume range is perfect for all of my needs and even goes a couple of notches too loud.<br /><br />The size is perfect. I can fit it into most of my pockets and, in my transport satchel, it nestles in with my laptop power adapters nicely.<br /><br />Parts-wise, the battery cover isn't ever going to fall off and the wafer-ish battery isn't useful in any other hardware that I own:<br />BL-5C<br />3.7 V 1020m Ah<br />Rechargeable Li-ion Battery 067038611124249898<br /><br />There are 3 removable parts: the 3.5 audio cable, the USB power cord (both about 24 inches long), and the power socket AC adapter:<br />Model: WT0501000<br />Input: 100-240V-50/60Hz 1.6A<br />Output: 5.0V - 1.0A<br /><br />***** 5 Stars for filling the needs I laid out for my desired device.

This is the big one and the 2 Star deduction is all for this. To be able to use the device, I MUST have some charge in the battery. I cannot simply plug in and get to listening if the battery has been depleted.  This would not normally be a problem if it were not for the battery not being able to hold its charge longer than about a day.  Yes, even if I let it charge for 8 hours, make sure the power switch is off, and then pack the device away for 48 hours, the battery will be completely drained and I then have to charge it for 30 minutes to an hour before I can start to listen to anything.<br /><br />I wasn't really interested in packing this to a picnic or anything, but if I were to do that I'd have to be sure to have it plugged into the car charger until we got to the park.  I've listened to it for 5 or 6 hours without it being plugged in AFTER I discovered this problem, so, for some reason, it can hold a charge, just not for more than a day.<br /><br />This is a double-doozy because if the battery ever completely poops-out I will be forced to buy another battery which is really irritating considering I always have a power socket within arm's reach.

Even if the battery performed properly, eventually, after the battery wore out, I'd be left with a useless brick of expensive plastic. What if this particular, obscure battery is no longer available in a few years?<br /><br />Ok, moving on. Bluetooth.

"I bought this cable to use \\""while\\"" I was charging my iPad 3.  Unfortunately, it fails miserably at that.  If it is jostled at ALL, the plug falls out, or comes loose and no longer charges the device.  I frequently use this cable at the end of the day, and my iPad is quite a distance from the power source.  And, my standard cable is not long enough to reach where I need it to go.  So, I was hoping that this cable would solve that problem.  Unfortunately, I need to keep looking.  :(<br /><br />It works great if it isn't moved at all.  And, I mean, at all.  No bumping, jostling, tapping, touching, jiggling, wiggling, wriggling, dancing, vibrating, rubbing, or other extraneous movement.  So, plug it in, put it down, and step away from the iPad.  Do not touch it.  Don't be tempted to pick it back up.  Just... leave... it.... alone.  Zip it!  Uh uh.  Don't.... Do... it.",3,2

"This was the second screen cover I put on my iPhone, and I'm not as impressed as I was with the first one I had.  It took my three year old niece and a set of keys to get through the first cover, but this one is showing wear after only a couple of weeks.",3,1
The Bluetooth is very nice. But the sound is terrible. supper high tremble. alot of distortion. Would be fine i guess if you had a very quiet bike.,3,2

"I bought this case thinking that it loked great and gave wrap-around protection for my new iPod touch which was exactly what I was looking for. Problem is that the bottom of the case prevents you from being able to use a number of docking devices due to too much plastic being in the way. Also, because it is such a snug fit to slip over you iPod it caused the edges of my Gorilla Glass screen protector to detach from the corners which wrecked the protective film. I was able to get the Gorilla Glass film replaced by Geek Squad for free because it was guaranteed by them but it was still a hassle none the less. Bottom line... if you never have to worry about screen protectors or iPod docks then this case is great, otherwise I found that the snap-on rubberized cases are less expensive, don't cause the issues that I mentioned, and offer even better wrap around protection.",3,1
"The adaptor charges my device, and comes with certain plug-ins that can be used in different countries.<br />What I did not expect (and is not shown on the picture) is that the connector to the Archos 704 is not a standard connector, but part of the specialized bottom part of the Archos 704. It charges, but uses the special adaptor on the bottom of the device.<br />Since I have several Archos versions, I was hoping I could use this for all of them, but unfortunatly that will not be the case.",3,2
"I don't actually care about watching video on a portable device; I bought the PMC because:  1) It's the only device that can play WMA Lossless, in which format I have all my music stored; 2) The Microsoft interface is aesthetically attractive and has some nice usability touches; and 3) I don't want to have to install a driver, so something that works through the USB Mass Storage interface is great.  (That it also works with WMP 10 without any drivers is also a nice touch, but kinda cheating, since WMP 10 specifically supports PMCs.) <br /> <br />After using it for several days, I'm of mixed opinions.  The software is pretty good, but still has some 1.0-style rough edges to it; it's probably on par with the iPod (though obviously very different), and way above Archos or iRiver, though.  If you appreciate visual elegance, there's nothing in the PMC's league; if it's usability lagniappes that flip your switch, the PMC has some really nice bits (overlaying large letters when you fast-scroll through a list, for instance) and some really clumsy ones (its handling of artist/album artist/composer tags for classical music). <br /> <br />The actual hardware is less awkward than you'd think, thanks to the nice leather-ish included case, which has a magnetically clasping cover that, when opened, acts as a stand to prop it up.  Still, it's fairly big, and the controls are placed to preclude one-handed operation, so you have to pay attention to it when you   want to change things. <br /> <br />As a pure music player, it's ultimately compromised:  A nice, but not ideal UI mixed with too-bulky hardware for a price that really is more than a bit much.  Still, it's really not bad, and if I were at all interested in video, it'd probably be that much more compelling. <br /> <br />(As for the putative one-hour battery life of the previous review, um, no.  I haven't timed it but it's much, much longer than that for sure.  Perhaps he's leaving the screen on full-time?)",3,1
the &#34;speaker&#34; or whatever doesnt stick very well.it is very cool technology but i am rarely in a position that i dont have a stereo around to use instead,3,2
"The manual to this radio is a complete joke because of the poor translation from Chinese to English. One example is the instruction to enter the off-set for repeater operation. The manual says to press function and then the f4 button to change the +/- offset. That did not work and I spent the better part of an hour trying to understand what I (let me repeat that...I) was doing wrong. The problem was that \\""I\\"" was NOT doing anything wrong. Pushing function and then f4 buttons, is not the way to set off-sets.  You have to HOLD the f4 button down for a few seconds. I figured this out because I was at my ends with the device and just decided to see what would happen. In my mind, I was hoping this would not kill the radio or reset it, or whatever. So, off to a very bad start, I managed to program (from scratch) a few of my local repeaters.  Another issue is this is a \\""from scratch\\"" radio with absolutely NO automatic offsets. You must set the offset range, and everything on EACH frequency you program.  Contrast this with the Jetstream, where everything is automatically set from the factory. You never have to worry about offsets because they are done. I'm pretty sure all TYT radios are like this, because my UVH-1 is the same.<br /><br />One of the reasons I bought this radio was that it is advertised as putting out 55 watts of power. I live far and in the mountains, so I need wattage to hit repeaters. Again, another let down because on my Yaesu YS-500 meter, the radio registers at 45 watts on high power.  So where is that extra 10 watts I'm supposed to have? SWR was not an issue, and neither is coax. Both were in tip top for the test.<br /><br />The looks of the radio are great. I love the display and color options. The mic is good, but the keys only light up on the outside. All the middle DTMF keys are not lit. Do they get their light from the outside lit keys? Yes, but not that great. Kinda lame, actually.<br /><br />The radio also gets very hot while in operation. I would recommend a fan if you're going to use it on high a lot.<br /><br />*** See my programming update below ***<br /><br />73 de N5TENd recommend a fan if you're going to use it on high a lot.<br /><br />*** See my programming update below ***<br /><br />73 de N5TEN",3,1
"Most people I know who have an iPhone (either 3 or 4) use a phone cover/skin of some sort to protect their phone. Unless you are planning to remove your iphone cover each time you wish to mount it, don't buy this item. Even without the iphone cover, it is a VERY tight fit for my iPhone 4S (as it is for my wife's iPhone 3). Though that probably secures the phone better, it is quite hard to insert and remove. With the cover on, it doesn't fit AT ALL.    Look elsewhere if you want to use an iphone cover. Otherwise, this is an inexpensive mount that fits the knob of my old Garmin base - which would have been great had the cradle itself actually worked for me :-(",3,1

Instructions are not usable, and it came with different markings/name (even a different setup interface) on the camera than advertised.<br />I also purchased a non-gps holder along with this unit and the connections do not match. So I am not sure if the camera I received is a fake or if the holder is a fake.  Not having a comparison I tend to believe that the camera is fake because it seems very different from what I read and watched on youtube about the Mini 0801 Ambarella camera.",3,2
"Honestly, You can buy it at Mall*Wart for 11.99. I really like it. It doesn't eat up batteries provided you use good batteries and not cheapies like ray-o-vac or lesser quality. 2 AAA will last a few months in warmer weather, less in cold weather - I leave it in my car and live where it gets -20 in January. I commute 140 miles a day - 3 to 4 days a week and use this 80 percent of the time. That proves how long the batteries last! Beware when the batteries are very low as this thing will start pumping out LOUD obnoxious noises that will likely scare the crap out of you because its so unexpected. It does have a bit of static near cities that have tons of radio stations. The only way I found to get rid of that is to wrap my hand completely around it to shield it. But on the highway its great. Also if your cell phone is very close this thing will pick up weird signals from the phone and transmit it over the speakers.",3,2
It works awesome :] I was buying it for my husband & I have the same one. I even checked the boxes to make sure they were the same. But my only complaint would be that I thought it had a glow light (like mine did) but it didn't.,3,1
Works great but cord is too short. If is was a foot or so longer it would be great. I would recommend but understand you have to hold down by stereo to use,3,1
"Yes, it's all plastic, but it looks great. This piece is not for the audiophile (necessarily), but I'm happy I have it. Great radio reception that sounds decent. A truntable that plays at three speeds (78, 45, and 33 1/3 rpm) and stops automatically at the end or a record. I like this unusual feature, because you don't have to worry about the tonearm returning to its cradle or the needle just resting in the dead wax as the record spins, both of which could potentially damage the needle. Sonic quality on the playback of records varies depending on the record itself. I noticed that older records, especially those recorded in mono, sound better than newer ones and those in stereo. But overall, if you're looking for an attractive retro design unit with a decent am/fm radio and a way to play that all-but-forgotten record collection, this is not a bad choice. My friends and I have a lot of fun playing our records for each other with this. One important consideration: there is no info on how you obtain a replacement needle for this unit. I also own a Crosley suitcase record player, and I think maybe they use the same needle. Crosley replacement needles are available for purchase, but to make sure that they will work, contact either the maker of this player or Crosley for more information.",3,1
"I bought these subs from a friend as a \\""Starter Set\\"". I recommend this kit to someone who just starting or just slightly more bass in their vehicle.

Got this headset as a less expensive option compared to the best headsets available due to time restraints. The set worked fine four about a month or so then the mic quit working. Luckily they have a seven (7) year warranty so that's an upside. Other than that they work well and do their job. Comfort is not the best but I have used worse.,3,1
"I just received the cover yesterday, It's a lot like the films you can get   from ebay, but this one just costs you more.

Bads, I think they should include a back cover film as while, the back side of   iphone still mades of glasses, right? so why don't you make one for the back?  I am confused.  Needs improvement",3,1
"Okay, I admit, I'm a geocaching dork. I'm okay with that. So that is my primary use for it...geocaching. The only beef I have with it is that it is SLOW to update. As you are tromping thru the woods or desert or marshlands, whatever, you have to pause a good solid minute or two to allow it to catch up once you are getting close to your waypoint. But hey, that's part of the fun. Things that I like- the screen is very easy to read, it emits a sound when you are getting close to your way point, very small and easy to carry, the geocaching integration with the web interface is okay but I found that I was spending more time trying to get it to save the file correctly than it was worth so quit using it unless I know I'm going on a rough trail or something. It has the same features as pretty much any GPS in this class has. But I'll have to admit, I've used the backtracking more than a few times to save my bacon. I'd probably be rotting in the Tillamook Forest if I hadn't had my Magellan with me. I bought it when it first hit the market. It was probably over priced then, but the going price for it now seems about right. I'd recommend it, but don't expect it to be speedy with the coordinates. I've been using it for right around three years and don't feel the need to buy a new one. Since I'm a techno junky, I guess that says something on it's own. :)",3,1

"I just got this in the mail and immediately I went to go test it with my FiiO E7 and Grado SR80is.

"I was nervous about buying this wire cause it was so cheap and had mixed reviews. Bottom line, it is worth buying. I works about 95% of time times. Biggest issue is if I hit a bump to hard or passenger is playing w/the phone, sometimes the plugs becomes loose and have to push back into place. This doesn't happen often but often enough to bother me.",3,2
My wife loves the bike. It assembled easy. Looks really good.,3,1
I purchased this item to hold my Coby Kyros 7024 tablet. The case arrived with 3 large strips of velcro to adhere to the back of the tablet and place in the right side of it. The strips are large enough to essentially cover the entire back of a device. The left side has a small net pouch to hold accessories and the middle is a SD card holder for about 8 or more cards.  The main issues I have is the case is too large for a 7 or 8 inch screen device. I guess I did not realize how large it is. The SD card holder sort of gets in the way of the device. With all of the extra room it would have nice to have some extra slots on the left side for business cards or a pen loop.  Overall for the price it is a decent item. I would recommend you look at the specifications so you will not be surprised by the size.,3,2
"I could not find a description of the length of this cord anywhere, so I took a chance.  It turned out to be short, I was wanting a longer cord.  The picture made it appear to be longer than it was.  I was dissapointed.",3,2
Always says battery is low like a day after I put a new battery in... works decently though.,3,1
"Given the positive reviews for this item, I have to say I was dissapointed.  It does charge your device.  But for 5000mAh, I expected for it to charge for a lot longer.so far, I have been able to charge my 1200mAh phone twice from one charge before it starts cutting off.  Also, it does have an LED light to show you how much of a charge is left, however when it goes from halfway to nothing, it can be very frustrating.  I will probably give this to my wife and go with the bigger version.  I hope to have better luck with it, as I travel a lot and require a portable means to keep my phone and iPod battery charged.  Hopefully others are having better luck with their than I with mines.",3,1
"I've had mind machines before and was looking for a small device that I could carry with my while on trips. Yes, the MC Square is small, but this goes on the cost of its usability.The screen is very small and you need to have very good eyes if you want to see something on it. Some knobs are placed on the side of the device, some are touch sensors on it's front and if you do not use it for a while you quite easily forget where was what.  This all would not have created a big problem for me. The biggest problem I have with it is that the LED's which are built in the glasses are quite weak so that the effect of it's stroboscopic light is really visible only when you are in complete darkness. So at night in bed you might enjoy the MC Square but if you use it during the day, you might even not see the lights at all.",3,2
"Did fine for a while, but then lost the time due to electric outage, and now unable to set time, because It doesn't work anymore.  The music part is good, not great.",3,2
"Love the compact aspect of the piece that connects to the iPod, but the reception on any station/channel has noticeable static, and the remote is made of cardboard and doesn't work.",3,1
Great product worked as I expected sometimes have to adjust it to stop the static but overall works pretty well. Only bad thing was is that the part that the charger plugs into fell out? Talk about cheaply made LOL luckly it still works like a charm if you just put some aaa batteries in it.,3,1
"I'll have to agree with some of the other reviews~  the battery doesn't fit quite right.  You'll have to fold up a little piece of paper and wedge it at the bottom to shim the battery up against the contacts.  Other than that, it works fine with good long life between chargings and will play all day.  Since I'm not swapping batteries back and forth the battery fit isn't too much of a problem.  Still, I'm only giving it three stars because it claims to be an exact replacement.          I did check my model and battery part number carefully to make sure I wasn't buying this battery for a model not specifically listed.  My device is a Creative NOMAD MuVo2 and the original battery part number was BA20203R79903.",3,1
I needed a product to cover my ipod and attach to my arm while I exercise at the rec center.  It does what I need it to do and it is comfortable on my arm.  I don't think the skin would take a lot of abuse though so don't throw it around or stuff it in a backpack.  I keep mine in a drawer or in the outer pocket of my gym bag.  I'm satisfied with its performance.,3,1
It is ok - not to impressive. But it is keeping a cover over the ipod and keeping it safe from scratches.,3,1
"This is the absolute no-frills iPod dock.  I like its simplicity.  I do not need (or want) a unit with a bunch of extra features that I will never use.  (Be realistic, you are never going to navigate playlists, much less create one using the remote from across the room!)  You can go forward back in your playlist, turn the volume up and down, and pause via the remote. What more do you need?    Sound quality is pretty good.  It definitely has a clearer, crisp sound compared to my Logitech AudioStation (older version of the newer Pure-Fi Elite).  However, the AudioStation has much better bass although some would call it muddy.  Personally, I like the richer bass and find it \\""warmer.\\""  As far as sound levels go... I would say that the Amplifi easily fills a room or two with sound - probably more than you would ever realistically use unless you were having a serious party.  However, I would say the Logitech fills the _house_.  Much louder - easily surpassing the Amplifi.    I am not being negative on the Amplifi - I still like it very much and think its terrific!  However, if the choice was between this or the Logitech, I would choose the Logitech.",3,1
"The sound is very good with little distortion at increased volume. The radio reception with this unit, in our spotty area, is the best we've had on an inexpensive receiver.<br /><br />However, the CD player, used primarily for audio books, is crap! It is noisy while playing ... a kind of scuffing noise that detracts from and can even interfere with dialogue. For some classical and romantic music CD's it is also noticeable and can wreck a mood. I don't know if it can be changed out, but I'd like to try.<br /><br />Another unexpected non-benefit is that after a few moments, even if you have made the pre-sets, the large light on the console display starts flickering wildly when the CD stops. Also, for night play, it can't be turned off if you just want to listen and don't care where you are on a CD or the radio. It is very bright. Very annoying. It is impossible to sleep with the flickering. I'd like to find a way to disconnect the light.<br /><br />So, if you want good sound while trying a sleep deprivation experiment, this is the unit with which to do it.",3,1
"This light is excellent while you are actively using it. If you position it right the light is pretty evenly distributed. It fits perfectly in the leather case that it is advertised with. I have had no trouble with glare at all.  It is a great reading light.    My one big complaint is that when you are not actively using it, it does not store well at all.  The light just sticks out of the top.  If you put the light in the proper place in the top of the leather holder the light hangs out of the top. I have had to move it out of the proper place when I am not using it and put it all the way at the bottom. It still sticks out of the top, just not as bad.  It is a real inconvenience because I always have to be very careful where I set it and how I carry it because I am afraid I will break the light.      I rate this 3 stars because it does function great while you are using it. I just wish the maker would have thought about what to do with it when you're not.",3,1
"This charger does what is supposed to do but it is very cheaply made (the cover to the 30-pin connector came off the very first time I used it) but it performs its basic function of charging an iPod.  I do not anticipate long-term reliability for this product, but at this price point that is perhaps a reasonable trade-off.",3,2
"Kind of frustrating at first, since there are no (English) instructions.  It works. Accepts drag-and-drop of music files from PC without any special software. Allows music to be organized into up to three playlists.  Not bad for the price.  Seems to want to start at the alphabetical begining of the playlist every time and go straight through, but there may be a way to change that that I just haven't figured out yet.",3,1
the suction cup portion keeps ripping therefore unable to keep a tight suction. I've replaced it two times. I think I may look for a dashboard holder instead of placing a 3rd order.,3,2
"We bought the purple cover and a green cover at the same time.  The purple cover does a great job protectig, but you can not get the buttons and such to work as the inserts for buttons do not line up.  A bit dissapointing.",3,1
"I bought this item for my daughter's IPod. The cases fit good until the bottom where you charge the IPod; each case is a bit loose and does not have a tight fit. The price is great on four cases. In addition this bundle claims a screen protector to be included, in which it DID NOT, so please make sure, if you order this product the screen protector is included.",3,1
I ordered two splash screens priority mail (1-3 days) and received them 6 days later. To ship one would have been $14.98 and they just doubled my shipping to $24.98.  The product is great but there is no phone number to talk to anyone in customer service and they don't respond to emails. So I give them a zero on customer service.  Be prepared to pay ridiculous shipping on anything they send.,3,2
"I have tried 3 different brands of this speaker: HYPE Pyramid, MOCREO, and Bolse. Although there are more that I haven't tested such as the MDN, LuguLake Triangle, Aukey, Cooligg, SoundBot SB520, and CredDeal, all of them have the exact same silver (sometimes gold) curved pyramid/triangle with passive woofers on the side. All of these brands claim most of the same things. They all claim things like a 10 hour battery life, 10 total watts from dual 2&#34; speakers, bluetooth 4.0, HD sound, great bass, &#34;3D&#34; sound,  and a &#34;chip&#34; that enhances the sound even further. If you research many of these, as I am writing this review, I don't think any of those brands have less than a 4 star review but I think many of us know that a good review can be bought with a free product or created with a lack of knowledge of competitors.  I originally had the HYPE &#34;pyramid&#34; which was unfortunately damaged in an 7 foot fall onto concrete. I still have it and it still works but one of the speakers buzzes. Just that is enough to drive me nuts to I went on a journey to find a better and possibly cheaper HYPE. Since they all looked the same, I assumed they sounded the same. I then purchased the Bolse version, returned it, bought the MOCREO version and returned it too. I will get to my review of this speaker but I wanted to preface it with letting fellow amazoner's and audiophiles know that these speakers look the same but don't even compare. They don't sound the same, have the same name or price but share the same casing for some reason. Out of the three brands, the HYPE has, by far, the best sound quality and bass. I encourage you to stay away from the Bolse version: the more expensive, subpar sounding twin. Now for the review of the Bolse:<br /><br />The unit seems perfectly built; seamless corners, sturdy construction, heavy weight and expensive feeling, and no rattling. It looks fantastic. The battery life lasts all day. It gets around the claimed 10 hour battery life depending on volume level of course and can get loud enough to fill a room. Sound quality is extremely muddy though. for those of you who don't know what that means, the best way I can describe it is that it sounds like a good speaker with a blanket over it. Theres not enough treble or clarity and instruments seem to blend together. It doesn't sound natural at all. The poor sound quality can achieve the level of &#34;decent&#34; when you turn on the &#34;3D&#34; mode by holding the next and back buttons at the same time. you'll know when its activated when a green light stays on. compared to the HYPE, the bass is almost nonexistent. you can definitely feel the woofers and sometimes see them vibrating and moving which is what I think has &#34;wowed&#34; reviewers into good reviews (along with excellent battery life and great looks).<br /><br />physically, this unit is 5 stars. great quality, looks and battery life.<br /><br />From an audio standpoint it is, as previously stated, mediocre at best. 3 star audio quality at best. The worst of the three I have owned.<br /><br />I can't say that I recommend this speaker but if you value battery life don't care about sound quality that much, its not a bad speaker<br /><br />Ryan",3,1
Good quality but bulky/heavy,3,1
"the flashlight is nice ... built pretty well. But the little strap busted off mine after about 3 weeks of use. I got a brighter UltraFire Cree, so this now serves as a backup flashlight at work.",3,1
"Did not like this skin sticker for my Ipod touch, it did not fit nor protect the itouch. Poor quality...",3,2
"When I received it, it  worked like it was supposed to. But because it's cheaply made I now have to have it at just the right angle for it to connect. Sometimes I have to adjust the plug in on the inside of the piece to have a good connection. Don't really know how long it's going to last.",3,2
"Map is inaccurate. Tried 2 separate trips in my RV using this with newest map installed, routed me wrong on State highway twice.<br />Once had me U-turn after telling me to enter highway headed West instead of East, other foul up was having me exit highway only to have me get right back on same highway 1 mile later. U-turns not much fun in 40' rv towing 20' car. I had high hopes but not looking promising for cross-USA mapping",3,2
I must constantly adjust the armband because perspiration causes it to slip.  Too tight and it hurts the muscle.  I'm still searching for a great armband!,3,1
Does it's job. Slightly cumbersome to hook on but I can read in the dark.,3,1
"thought this was something different than it is.  I'm not a techie and was confused what it was.  no instructions at all came with this item, no description.  it works but then you can't wear headphones when driving.",3,2
Sound not the greatest.,3,1
"Fits perfectly, the directions were clear. I recommend you YouTube a \\""how to\\"" for easy and simple tips. The mirror looks like a real mirror. It doesn't look cheap. It doesn't scratch and it cleans up real nice. The only bad thing is that in the light it has a glare sometimes.",3,1
A male to female dock extension cable is essential for using some docks with the iPhone 4/4S. The RadTech cable is made well thought the fit on the female end is a tad wiggly and the fit on the male end can be very tight.  I have gotten three of these cables and one did not work. I suspect a wiring error. Factory QA should catch defective cables and reject them rather the let them ship.,3,2
The wires for the power and antenna are thin cheep and break easily.,3,1
"Worked nicely, since it's waterproof you can throw it into your sports bra and GO! That part was great. It eventually ran out of juice I guess, after a few months it stopped charging and wouldn't connect with my computer. The first few months were great though!!",3,1
Serves the purpose but could have been made to fit a little better.,3,1
"BUT ... it is super hard to get a clear sound. I have a lot of static! I bought this to use in my 2002 Saab when I bought the new Samsung Galaxy Note. I now have all my music on my Note, but had no way of playing the music in the car. Unfortunately, it didn't work as I had expected. lots of static/white noise in the backround",3,1
"I had a seriously difficult time applying the screen protector to my iPhone. By following the directions exactly, I kept getting air bubbles irregardless. A trick I learned to get rid of whatever dust is to take regular adhesive tape and apply it to the screen protector and then peel the tape off to take off any of the dirt. When I did this I noticed that the screen protectors themselves were packaged with a layer of dust, hence why I kept getting air bubbles. Some of the dust that came on the screen protector from packaging was difficult to take off - they looked like little specks of loose white plastic, something that adhesive tape had a hard time ripping off the back. If you end up getting a package and just cannot get rid of the air bubbles, these little specks are probably the reason why. I kept at it and kept applying new tape until i could finally get all of the dust off of the screen protector, and then I used a credit card rather than the crappy card they give you to smooth out whatever small air bubbles still appeared. After all of that hard work, it now doesn't look like I have a screen protector on my iPhone at all. I think for the price, you could definitely get something better, but for the Verizon iPhone 4, I wasn't able to find anything cheaper than this. I gave up after the screen protector portion and didn't bother using the bonus back film that they give you. Instead I purchased an actual case by elago, and it's absolutely awesome. I would recommend purchasing a case made by elago off of amazon to protect the back portion of your iPhone over the back film protector that this package provides you. Overall, I give it three stars.",3,2
"Good concept however is not loud enough. It sounds very low when is between the cushions, also is hard to hear if you are in a two story home. Make sure your TV is off when you are looking for it.",3,2
"I've had this for close to a month and it's a nice little player for the price. It plays music and video; the camera is a lil crappy, but it works. It doesn't support playlist functions, nor does it have album art. So basically, you don't get all the software bells and whistles that you'd get with an iTouch; I still recommend it.",3,1
They fail to tell you it will charge very slowly when you try to charge two devices at once with this item.,3,2
"Would like to share couples of Cons I experienced in 4 years of use, but overall, Garmin nuvi 780 is a good buy. (Don't know why Amazon says first available date is at 2010, but this product was already released earlier.)<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. After consistent charging/overcharging frequently, battery later became draining very fast during every use.<br />2. The sucking mount is not working anymore. Cannot stick to the window. It started to fail after about 1 year of heavy use.<br />3. Some lagging/freezing issue, when operate the device. Like when entering the address.<br /><br />I recently gave this to my gf, I bought another refurbished Garmin GPS from eBay around 50 bucks, everything works well so far, overall, love both the products.",3,1
Did not fit my 2008 dodge charger good! But still worked,3,2
"I took a trip with my truck to try it out. It really is a nice GPS with a lot of features. The menues make sense when you try to find different features.The suction cup mount is solid and held well. The display is clear. I loved the mp3 player and the way it stops the song and announces the upcoming turn. I hooked mine up to the radio through the aux. jack. Navigating the screen was a little tedious if you were on the move but it got easyer as you learned where stuff was. Some things I did not care for are:  1.If you are using a dark icon to represent where you are on the map it is difficult to see at night if you have the screen in the dark mode. I had to change it to a light colored icon.(no big deal)  2. The text to speech was choppy sometimes. This made it hard to react at interstate speeds when your eyes were on the road.  3.FM transmitter was poor. (I've never seen a good one yet. They have a weak signal. Laws limit output power)  4. I went to update the map to 2009. You get a free map upgrade to the latest map. This is nice because maps are about $70.00. That's when the problems started. I downloaded the 1.9 Gig file. Everything went smooth till it tried to update the map file. I would get an error and the update would fail. I re-downloaded the map file in case it got corrupted when I downloaded it the first time. I tried it with Windows XP,Vista and Windows 7 with the same results. Worse yet it corrupted the files on the GPS. Local streets were missing and highway names would be spelled in part english and part foreign charicters. I sent a problem report to Garmin but not being one to give up I tried updating with an old laptop I had laying around and it updated without a hitch. Now I am happy again.   I do not have a bluetooth phone but that looks like a handy feature.  I like the SD memory card slot for extra storage. When you plug your GPS into your computer the Nuvi and the SD card act like external hard drives. You drag and drop stuff onto the drives. It is simple.  Typing in an address is easy. The verbal turn instructions came in time to make the turn and when you turned it suggested staying to the left or right lane if you had another turn coming up quickly. Handy if your on the city freeway. I could recieve satalite signals in parts of my basement. Prety Impressive. Overall I am pretty happy with this GPS. At the pesent time I will not use the bluetooth feature. I will also not use the picture viewer or some of the other gadjets. Would I pay $500.00 for this thing? No. Would I pay $226.00. I think it's worth that. I will take it for another test run with the updated maps and see if the choppy voice was fixed.  Update 06-20-09 There is a patch to fix the voice stuttering. It works well. I use this GPS on my motorcycle now and I wouldn't go anywhere without it. I use a RAM motorcycle mount. I installed a lighter outlet on my cycle so I plug the GPS in. The RAM mount allows for leaving the GPS mount with the power cord on the unit.Very handy for those country roads when you don't have a set course and with a push of a button you can chart your course home. It is now a permanent part of my cycle travel gear.",3,1
"Sound could be a lot better, but for the price and the things it can do its pretty nice. This is something you would get just to have some music really quick or in a vehicle you don't care too much about.",3,1

Very small and cute and compact but i don't get any of the radio stations in my office.  I bought it for that purpose so kinda disappointed that the antenna isn't strong enough to get radio where my cube is located.,3,1
They don't last very long.  Purchased one for my daughter 6 mos. ago and it's already not working very well and she'll soon need a new one.,3,1
Overall nice case. The screen protector didn't fit correctly once the case was on so my daughter couldn't use that.,3,1
this is ok it works well with a nice stereo system but that's about it. also they discontinued the zune all together,3,1
"The armband secures my iPod nano securely when I'm on the treadmill and the  band doesn't slip or move on my arm.  However, once the iPod is placed in the case holder, I cannot operated the click wheel through the clear plastic front.

"This works better than some other aftermarket Bluetooth systems, but Alpine doesn't do a very good job of interfacing with the rest of the car. For example, don't be surprised if you can't get your steering wheel controls to work for making calls.<br /><br />This is an add on from an era when Bluetooth was not a standard feature and it's just not as slick as modern Bluetooth systems. But if you're looking at it, it's probably because it's the only thing that will work with your current head unit and you don't want to buy a new head when your current one works just fine.<br /><br />Slight better than average, but four stars seems too generous. 3 stars.",3,1
Good sound quality.. My only concern is the charger plug in.. It doesn't have enough protection for being a &#34;water proof&#34; product,3,1
When ordering products be sure to look at the dimensions. The picture is a little misleading because the unit is actually very small. It does work great and makes a good shop stereo but I was looking for something bigger for inside the house. I have no problems with the quality of the product just disappointed in myself for not looking at the dimensions.,3,2
"It is just okay. Arrived on time and can be used by Mercedes Benz, but the dealer still gets you because you need the internal pc card that allows the remote to work as intended. Slight savings, dealer still gets blood out of you with high price to replace it.",3,1

"This product is the latest in my hopes to find a working fm transmitter. I use an ipod nano in the car for audio books. i was hoping i could plug the nano into this product using the aux in feature and transmit to my radio. my car does not have a tape deck or aux in.<br />The bluetooth connectivity is a bonus that i didn't need, but am using for hands-free calls on my phone.<br />The unit is small and easy to plug in to the accessory outlet of my car. because the unit has no gooseneck, it may be hard to plug into some accessory outlets in other vehicles. i had a little trouble plugging it into my wife's element.<br />having a lit display makes it easy to see what station you are tuned to. the red and blue lights for bluetooth phone and bluetooth audio connection are also handy.<br />i live in an area with a very full fm band. it is hard to find open frequencies to use. i have found only 1 frequency that seems to work reliably. i wrote accessory genie and they suggested about 6 frequencies that should have been open, but none of them work. i appreciate the effort, though. even with this frequency being fairly decent, i still have bleed through as i drive from home to work (about 28 miles). this doesn't happen often and i can live with it as long as it doesn't get worse.<br />where the product falls short is in the aux in functionality. if something is plugged into the aux in or aux out ports the auto frequency and volume controls are disabled as well as the mic and audio out for the hands-free phone features. having the above features disabled doesn't work well if i need to find a new station or adjust the aux in volume. i have to unplug the aux in then adjust auto frequency or aux in volume. when i receive a call i have to unplug the aux in in order for the caller to hear me or me to hear them. I have been told that this functionality is by design.",3,2

Slim profile. Folds back easily and comfortably. Reasonably light-weight. Does not use hooks or straps, but gently snaps around the corners for a good fit.<br /><br />The leather is not genuine, but it is smooth and does not have a strong odor. It looks inexpensive but not tacky. The back of the Kindle looks fantastic, but the front is bland and a little puffy.<br /><br />Problem: The construction quality is lousy. The microfiber suede lining (which is a little warm to the touch) has ragged edges all along the border where the fabric was cut. Loose threads hung off the sides and needed cutting. Worse: the lining was improperly glued to the cover and had huge bubbles! I took a ruler and smoothed them out - pushed the air out and pressed the lining down into place. There is a tiny crease still where the fabric was misshapen, but it's barely noticeable.<br /><br />For $19, free shipping, and my immediate need of a cover, I'm willing to make these compromises and accept the product. The design is clever. I'm going to keep shopping for a new option, though.",3,1
"If you want a mp3 player, this is good for its price. It says it has FM, but it doesn't work that well. You can't hear the stations clear at all. Plus, you can't see the stations you are on.

I would recomend this for people who don't want to spend money on mp3 players, and who like to listen to their music at the gym.",3,2
Ok for the money.,3,2
"I'm a huge SONY fan, but this is one of the VERY FEW products made by SONY that I didn't like.<br /><br />There are many positives to this products, but they become negligible when the main function of this product suffers. What I mean by that are several negatives that I want to point out.<br /><br />First is the touchscreen functionality. It's neat, very cool to have and may come in handy for students like me, but it becomes useless when the addition of the touchscreen layer makes the screen very hard to read, it is highly reflective and is hard to read even indoors. You always have to make sure you're sitting at the right angle with it and even the reflection from the ceiling may affect your experience. If the main selling point of e-ink is readability - then you can say it's basically absent in this product. It is much easier to read on the Kindle or even an iPad.<br /><br />Another aspect is the speed of the reader. It's laggy. I know e-ink works slow, but sometimes it's not the e-ink - it's the software and the slow processor of the reader itself.<br /><br />Another thing - is the turn page buttons. They are located at the bottom and are not very convenient to use. I wish they were on the sides like on Kindle or Nook. You can turn pages using the touchscreen, but you have to press very hard, because it's not a capacitive touchscreen.<br /><br />And the last thing that isn't as good as it is supposed to be - battery life. It's pretty short and I noticed that the battery drains when in sleep mode.<br /><br />In the end, I don't recommend this reader. I sold mine on eBay and will buy something else.",3,2
I probably would not get another.  I did not realize it was just a decal not an actual protectant cover.  It looks nice that's the only reason it got 3 stars not 2,3,2

"I consider myself extremely proficient with electronics and I regularly take electronics apart for repairs.  The tools included were made of a soft plastic and the iPod case cut through the plastic and destroyed the tools before I could get the iPod open.  It took me almost an hour to open the iPod.  Once it was open, the rest was very simple and now it works great.  5 stars for the battery, -2 stars for the crappy tools.",3,1

"I bought this a few months ago, and have found that something has happened inside so now the cable must be at the right angle to work. This cable is nice because of how small it is and how easy it is to bend, but if it stops working because of that ability, it isn't worth it.",3,2
"I liked In-Dash 7'' Widescreen color LCD Monitor TV/DVD/SD receiver while it was working fine.  The screen was big, it was easy to see, easy to change from GPS to TV or DVD.  I loved GPS on it.  But when the screen stopped coming out, I sent it for repair to Panasonic, but then I found out that Panasonic is not fixing this product, so Panasonic sent it to a different company for repair and now, half a year later, it is not fixed yet and this other company is just promissing me that it will be done in a week or two.  That is the same answer as I was getting some months ago.  So, the product is great, but it is a problem fixing it, at least in Illinois it is a problem.[[ASIN:B0006ABQ9S Panasonic CQ VD7500U - DVD player with LCD monitor and AM/FM/TV tuner]]",3,1
Case is really cute and I get a lot of compliments on it.  It fits really well with screen protector covering parts the screen protector does not. Great to use when tired of a bulky case such as the OtterBox.<br />Cons: there is some sort of coating on the back on the case (side with cats on it) that eventually begins to rub off. It doesn't take the picture off but the film that does run off gets everywhere and is somewhat difficult to clean.,3,1

"We love our JetBook!  I'd give it a 5 star rating, but since it is temperamental -- and that is a big issue in my opinion -- I'm only giving it a 3-star rating.    What we DO like about it is that it does NOT have back-lit screen, which is easy on the eyes. (My 8-year-old reads lots of books on this, so that's important for us. No \\""glazy, red video eyes\\"" after staring at this thing for long periods of time.)  It can be read exactly like a REAL book: Anywhere you have daylight or a light, you can read it. It's size is also nice (big screen but small footprint,)  It's great, too, that you can download free books off the internet (I use Gutenberg.org exclusively.) As long as you choose the .txt files, it's quick and easy to get material onto the JetBook. We need nothing fancy (don't even WANT internet capabilities with it since our kids use it,) so the simplicity of the JetBook suits us fine.    We also LOVE all the classic books that come pre-loaded when we bought it new. My son uses a literature-based curriculum for school, so many of the books he needs to read were already on this (White Fang, The Jungle Book, Moby Dick, Shakespeare stuff, Mark Twain stuff, etc. etc. etc.)    What I DON'T like about our JetBook -- and from what I've read we're not alone in this -- is that it will freeze often and need to be reset. It also has frozen before on me and I couldn't even reset it; it just stayed frozen on until I think the battery just died down. Looking at Ectaco's website, I kinda wonder if they care very much about this product? It's never advertised -- and they do much more with language translating type units and software. Perhaps this was just a little side-project for them? In any case, if they don't fix the stability of the JetBook, no one's gonna want to buy it.",3,1
"The picture lies, there is no pattern on the case itself, (i.e It's only blue.)...really disappointing because it was the main reason i wanted it, came in great packaging though, GOOD QUALITY.",3,2

If you go to courses that you haven't played before you will not be able to tell distances to hazards.  If that isn't a need get this watch.  If it is keep searching, they're out there and they don't cost anymore.",3,1
"I couldn't find this style of armband for my new Nano anywhere in stores. I needed something that wasn't too bulky, as I like to keep my player in the case all the time, even when not exercising.    So, as far as design and fit goes, it was perfect - slim, light, rubber, good armband.     Lost a star because it didn't come with any kind of screen protection - as the screen on the new iPod is so big, I would have expected something - even a sheet of plastic - to cover the screen and protect from scratches, fingerprints, etc.    I was also very disappointed in how long it took to receive this item. I usually receive stuff from Amazon - even on the \\""Super Saver\\"" shipping - in just a few days. I paid extra for shipping because I really, really wanted to use my new iPod (but didn't want to use it without a protective case!)... And it took ten days to arrive! From what I can tell, it shipped from the same state I'm in... So it could have grown legs and walked itself to my pad in that amount of time. (On the same Amazon order, we ordered a book that hadn't been released yet; it arrived four days before the armband!) After I placed the order, the \\""Track Recent Order\\"" screen indicated it would take ten days (again, even after paying extra for expedited shipping)... If I'd known that ahead of time, I know I would have bought something else.    Received a whole bunch of \\""accessories\\"" (car charger, etc.) that I guess are nice to have. But I would much rather have received the screen protector (and received this sooner)!",3,2
"I was very happy with this unit for a good two years.  It replaced the stock unit in my RSX and gave me great sound through my Bose speakers.  However, after two years, the mechanical face flip started giving me problems.  It would randomly get stuck and not flip down when I turned off my car, and there is no way to remove the face unless the motor pushes it down.  I lived with this issue, but after a few more months, the jog dial knob broke off of the face.  I'd say it has seen only moderate usage and no abuse, but the knob is made of cheap plastic.  I am forced to use the remote now if I want to use the unit at all.",3,2
good alarm but realy complicated to install and the cables are way to short so you might have to buy extras to install this alarm but it works good when its instald,3,1
I will admit I am a cheap skate... I bought this unit to put in a 06 Ford F150 and only bought it because it was so cheap and Amazon's return policy. First off it did not come with mounting brackets so I had to grind the rivets off the one that came on my factory unit and drill new holes to make it work. I was also installing a 500rms 1100 max watt 12 and 1100 watt amp with the intentions of turning heads everywhere I went. After I get everything hooked up and turned on I was surprised and disappointed at the same time. First the good... The bluetooth is awesome and easy to pair. The dvd player works great. The touch screen is spot on. The iphone works great with it. I haven't tried the flash drive yet but I am sure it will work too. Now for my bad..... YOU CAN'T ADJUST THE EQUALIZER IN ANYTHING BUT 3 PRESET SETTINGS!!!!!!!! WHY????? That is almost enough to make me return it but I won't because EVERYTHING else works perfectly! Would I recommend this for anyone who wasn't trying to beat the block down? YES! Would I recommend this to someone who had 1000 dollars in speakers? NO WAY. I am keeping for the time being but it will be moved to my wife's car when I find a good deal on another unit.,3,1

"This unit is made by a company in the Chinese  Shenzhen region called \\""Crosselec\\"" under the model number Z1R   I have 2 of these units (4gb) that I purchased for $48.00 each, One with and one without Bluetooth. With the 4 gb internal memory (Samsung) and the 8 gb class 6  micro sd card, I can listen to music for a month and a half without having to reload.   Nice strong signal; The Fm Transmitter is strong enough to avoid most interference, except for the some of the hardcore Christian stations who feel the FCC regulations don't pertain to them.   The remote is better than most of these similar units as it can switch from folder to folder (Album to Album) The unit loads fast with a few exceptions.  If you want to listen to music get this unit. If you want to use the Bluetooth please read on.  One of the things I noticed is this unit behaves like an over-clocked computer in some ways. It is good when it is good but when it crashes it goes down hard.   Ok, now for all the people that want music it is not a big deal because when it resets itself, it is between tracks and just restarts then continues on where it left off.   This is ok for me, but now if I hit the disk button and have to search through my SD card it will let you search about 40 songs and then it will go down and you have to start searching from the beginning again (very aggravating). But still as long as you don't hit the wrong button you are ok, problem is the \\""disk\\"" button is right below the \\""skip to next track\\"" button so it is easy to do.  The screen is pretty much worthless as it gives you sort of an idea what you are listening to (I think it is a problem from the language barrier). If they wanted to make the screen worth having, they should look at the Sansa or the IPod that displays the album art and the track information.  Now for the Bluetooth: the unit in most vehicles (plugs into lighter) puts the very poor quality microphone out of the range of the person talking into it.   It almost has to beabout 12\\"" from your mouth to work ,Or people will just keep complaining that they can't hear you.   Remember how I told you about the unit restarting itself? Well it does that in Bluetooth mode and ends calls without warning.  I have not had more than a 1 minute conversation on it without the unit cutting out.  The reason I need a portable unit like this one is I am in several different vehicles a day so I need something that can switch vehicles as fast as I do.  I think they need to put a stronger microphone in it and slow the clock down so it doesn't keep shutting down. So in a nutshell it depends on what you are planning to use it on.  I am still looking for the perfect unit :)",3,1
"I've opened the pack and appears be good, the finish is raw plastic, so don't wait glossy surfaces, recommend only VGA mode in video, others is too noisy, good supply in wires and the suction base is good, for the price is good value.",3,1
It works good as a screen protector but in almost any lighting it produces a lot of glare so you have to set the brightness on the IPOD to max to see through it.,3,1

"This was a great set of speakers, but you cannot use two speakers simultaneously when streaming from a mobile device.<br /><br />The Pros;<br />- they are very elegant looking, even the packaging was very nice<br />- decent sized devices with built in controls<br />- they took all of 5 minutes to set up<br /><br />The Cons;<br />- they cannot be used as a pair except if you are on a PC (most people stream from a mobile device, so this is a significant short coming)<br />- the sound was adequate but when I tested the Bose Soundlink Air, the AQ speakers sounded very weak (they are about the same price)<br /><br />It was disappointing that the L-R functionality didn't work on mobile devices but that may be a limitation of Apple AirPlay not AQ, but from a customer point of view we simply want something that works well and is easy to use.",3,2
"The sound of the speakers is very good considering their size and cost.  However, I have to adjust the volume on my iPod instead of on the speaker since whenever I touch the volume control the sound goes out whichever way I adjust the dial. There appears to be a bad connection in the unit.",3,1

Case covered Zune like expected and its nice. The free screen protector was also a nice bonus. But the bottom doesn't  let me use earphones and the case at the same time. There is no hole for that. It defeats the purpose when I can not use the case and earphones at the same time.,3,2

It works.,3,1
"Lady Voice  I was a bit puzzled by a review that complained about a lady voice, but after getting it, I now know what it was about.  Whenever the unit is turned on, a very loud announcement is broadcast, saying \\""Bluetooth on! Pairing mode!\\""  This is unavoidable, and overrides any previous volume settings. If you're turning it on at night next to anyone else, it's strident enough that you may do as I do and press it against your bed or something to muffle it a bit. Press the mode button again and she announces, \\""Radio mode!\\""    Aside from this quirky implementation, it works well enough for the rather low price sub 12-15 dollars.  The Bluetooth range isn't as phenomenal as with my Soundbot SB240 headphones, but good enough for same room use.  Oddly, it has trouble reconnecting for some reason, unlike other Bluetooth devices I have.  My Soundbot SB240 headset never has problems reconnecting, so it's apparently something unique to the SB570.  I sometimes find it necessary to delete the device from the list and add it anew, at which point it connects up again.  Not sure if it's possibly because I bought two of these and it's just confused- I'll have to experiment further.    FM radio reception is okay, with the USB cord plugged in acting as the antenna.    Battery life is decent and sound is fine for background listening.    Phone use is not good as the microphone pickup is low, not really usable for phone conversation unless you're just listening to the other party talking most of the time.    All in all though, you get a nice little device for the price.",3,1
"When I got it, the tape player didn't work from the get-go!  It's got horrible sound and is just a temporary till I can order me something else!  The only thing I presently use is the disc player....the radio is no use to me at all!",3,2
It was only $104. It turns on well. It does do Wi-Fi but you have to be close to download anything but it will download. I got this to do my personal email at work without using work computers and it does a decent job. It fits right in my coat pocket and does a decent job for $104.,3,1
"I bought this when my iPod Touch screen cracked. I consider myself fairly dexterous but found this to be a difficult install, which probably took me over an hour including several times when I thought it wasn't going to work. I had to use some superglue to hold everything in place, but otherwise all I needed was included. The screen works fine now, it is indistinguishable from the original, and everything has been holding up fine for several months. Glad I got it rather than buying a whole new iPod or paying lots to get it fixed professionally.",3,1

I bought two different covers. This was was inferior to the other one in both material and construction. I bought it for my granddaughter but I don't think it will hold up.,3,2
"Very cheap product.  One of the big rhinestone stones came off the day I received this.  It is very hard to take the case off once you put this on.  I have to be extremely careful so it does not break.  I have to take the case off everytime when I connect my iPod with speaker, that's not very convenient.  I am glad that I got this for less than the listing price.  Who wants to pay full price for this product? It's not worse more than $20!!!  That would be waste of money.  My iPod looks pretty with this case on though.",3,2
"I'm one of the dying breed who still uses a portable CD player, and I knew it wouldn't be easy when my old one broke - a Sony D-NE710.  Overall I was happy with that - it lasted several years, although some of the features were starting to go as far back as a year or two ago. This was the sole CD player available at my local electronics store, and I tried to do a little bit of research but didn't seem to get very far. Ultimately, I trust Sony despite hearing a few bad things about this item.<br /><br />I've only had this for 2-3 weeks at this point (bought brand new off the shelf), but I will update this review if the performance of the device changes.<br /><br />The good: So far, it operates as advertised. Doesn't skip, sound is (mostly) good, and it is pretty nice looking CD player as well.<br /><br />The details:<br /><br />Buttons: on my old unit, the location of the headphone jack was such that I could keep the CD player in my front pocket and easily reach the volume, stop, play, and navigation buttons. On this, in order to have the headphone jack accessible, the play and navigation buttons will be deep in my pocket and nearly impossible to reach. Hard to deny that you're behind the times if you have to completely remove the player from your pocket to change the song. Also, the buttons are a little stiff - you have to push them with intent, although that could prevent them from being accidentally bumped.  Assuming they hold up for a few years, I don't think it's a problem.<br /><br />Display: one of my largest complaints about the item. The player is not capable of displaying the time remaining in the song or in the rest of the album! My old sony player could do both, and honestly I would expect this to be a staple feature. The other problem is the location of the display: if you are sitting at the table and want to read the display, you will have to lift the player up so that it's nearly standing vertical just to see which track you are on.<br /><br />Features: There is no line-out port on this player, which is another disappointing omission from my old sony. The one nice surprise about this player relates to how it resumes play. My old player would start at the same position of the song after you pressed stop. This goes one step further - you can press stop, change the batteries (which requires removing the disc!), and then resume and the player will be at the same point in the album, and the same volume. Nice!<br /><br />Sound: My headphones are worth about $100; pretty decent but clearly not audiophile grade. That said, the sound seems mostly good to my ears. The one problem is that there is a soft hissing as soon as you press play. I briefly tried another Sony model which had the same problem (D-EJ001), but my old player certainly did not. It may not be terrible depending on the style of music, but for any sort of classical or ambient music it is particularly detrimental to the experience.  (Edit - the hissing was heard using my closed-ear headphones. It's barely perceptible using my open-ear headphones.)<br /><br />All in all, a pretty mediocre device but there doesn't seem to be a huge number of options available. If I haven't edited this by a year from now, at least you travelers from the future will know that the CD player is reasonably durable. I use it for around 3-4 hours a day, and it spends a lot of time in my backpack while not in use, placed there unceremoniously but not recklessly. Hope this helps.<br /><br />.<br />.<br />.<br /><br />EDIT: After using this for a few months, I have a couple additional complaints.<br /><br />For one, although I haven't tested the exact battery life, I seem to change the batteries much more frequently than with my old player.<br /><br />Secondly, the volume control is not very sensitive. At the volume I listen to it, often it will be slightly too quiet, but one click of the volume makes it too loud.<br />This is pretty frustrating considering the fact that the volume goesfrom 0 to 9, but with typical headphones you will set the volume around 4 maximum, even for older (non-remastered) albums.",3,2

"So far so good with the battery.  It doesn't last as long as the original.  I might get 7-8 hours out of it...which is fine for my purposes (cutting grass).    The tools that come with this battery are horrible.  I'm not sure if I'm more upset with the battery manufacturer for making crappy tools, or Apple for making their products difficult to open on purpose...damn you Apple.  My thumbs were raw from trying to pry the case open with the tools.  I had to eventually put on gloves.  I initially tried opening the case from the side, which was how the video online described it (no instructions were included...but there are a lot of youtube videos on how to do it)...this process was very difficult.  Not difficult in that it was confusing or hard to understand, but that the case took a long time to remove because of how it was built and the poor quality of the tools.  The sharp ends of the tools aren't rigid enough to sustain too much sustained pressure and they will get chewed up if you aren't careful.  Then I switched to the bottom edge of my iPod (the edge with the charging port) and I was able to pry the case off much better from that end first...just a tip.    Once the cover was off, it was a piece of cake.  You just want to go slow and be careful.  See how the existing battery is in there and put the new one in the same way.    Apple's desire to keep you out of the case so you can't replace the battery is very discouraging.  And this experience was bad enough that I will never buy an iPod (got this one for free).   If I ever buy an mp3 player, I'm buying one that has a removable battery.  It's just not worth the hassle and headache and the risk of breaking my iPod.  iPods aren't even the best mp3 players out there anyway...so what's the point?    Anyway...  This was a cheap battery that is a good value.  The battery isn't stellar, but it's not priced to be stellar.  It is what it is.  iPod batteries are supposed to get 12+ hours of battery life.  I only get 7-8 hours out of this one...but like I said, it didn't cost much and it suits my needs just fine.    If you absolutely have to have an iPod, save yourself the headache, buy a better battery with better tools for a little more money.  It's probably worth it.  If I ever buy another battery for this iPod, I'm buying one with better tools.",3,2

"As a buyer of well-over 300 Baofeng radios (and counting) for the group I belong to (not all of which were purchased through Amazon but many were), I'm always amazed at the lengths some sellers go to to hype their products as being \\""newer\\"" or \\""better\\"" than other models, or perhaps (to give them the benefit of the doubt) they just don't know any better.<br /><br />First, the Baofeng UV-5R series (including the original and still extremely popular UV-5R, I'll explain why in a minute) is what is normally referred to by many as a SDR radio (or software defined radio).  While not a true SDR product (you can't use it with your computer to control the radio's functions or scan a wide amount of VHF/UHF frequencies with it), none the less a large chip is programmed on the circuit board built inside each radio.  That chip determines what capability the radio itself can perform.<br /><br />Every UV-5R series radio has the ability to transmit from 136-174 MHz on VHF and from 400-520 MHz on UHF in both narrow-band and wide-band modes (very useful for the occasional FRS or MURS use, which requires narrow-band mode to work correctly).<br /><br />Every model does \\""at least\\"" 4W on VHF/UHF from the factory, but occasionally you'll get a batch that does 4.5W or even 5W out, but the difference between 4W and 5W is minimal at best.  A 4W radio with a better antenna will easily outperform a 5W radio with the standard crappy antenna that Baofeng ships on ALL (including the UV-5RA, -5RAX, and -5RAX+) models.<br /><br />Baofeng DOES NOT program those chips any differently for the UV-5R vs. any other UV-5R series (including the UV-5RA).  Version 307 of the firmware (which is the most current release I have in any of my radios) works EXACTLY the same way as previous older releases of firmware at least back to the 295 release (over a year ago), so any claim from a seller that this release provides additional features (at least from a user's perspective) is simply BOGUS, since the firmware inside both radios have the same features.  In fact, my UV-5R radios with the 307 firmware release is EXACTLY the same radio (inside and within the firmware) as my UV-5RA radios with the 307 firmware release.<br /><br />Second, you CANNOT in any way upgrade the firmware (unless you count buying a different radio and it comes with a different firmware release), so again the claim in the listing from some sellers that you can is simply BOGUS.<br /><br />Third, you can believe that two thinner pieces (glued or screwed together on the faceplate of the UV-5RA) is somehow stronger than one thicker piece of plastic (on the original UV-5R series) if you like (and maybe it is), but I haven't seen that in real-world use from my own UV-5RA units.  The standard UV-5R units that we use seem to hold up just as well (when dropped in the desert dirt or rolling down a hill) as any other Baofeng radio we own and use.<br /><br />Fourth, and my biggest issue with all of the non-standard UV-5RA, UV-5RAX and UV-5RAX+ units, is that NONE of the Baofeng battery accessories (except the little 1800 mAh standard battery) work WITHOUT modification (unless you use a Dremel tool to grind or cut off part of your extended battery that works on the standard UV-5R - but won't work on your UV-5RA, UV-5RAX or UV-5RAX+).<br /><br />Getting new UV-5RA units that don't work with Extended 3800 mAh batteries (without modification) doesn't make my group happy.  That may not bother you, but NONE of the sellers of the non-standard UV-5RA, UV-5RAX, and UV-5RAX+ units ever seem to mention that lack of hardware compatibility in their listings, so buyer beware!<br /><br />BTW, NONE of the \\""AA\\"" or \\""AAA\\"" battery shell packs work on the UV-5RA, UV-5RAX, or UV-5RAX+ units either, so that's 3 different battery accessories (including the 3800 mAh extended battery) that you can't use on these radios without hacking them with a Dremel tool (but they all work without modification on the original UV-5R units).<br /><br />So \\""if\\"" you want a \\""pretty\\"" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (or -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.  Oh, you should see how well that shiny faceplate lights up when a flashlight hits it in the dark, just the thing you don't want for night use.<br /><br />Virtually every guy in our group ends up carrying a standard UV-5R and giving the UV-5RA, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ to the wife or kids, since the wife and/or kids rarely care about the other accessories working and they (the wife and kids) tend to like the \\""pretty\\"" radios, but again there is NO INTERNAL difference and NO EXTRA FEATURES in the UV-5RA, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ units (other than a different looking shiny faceplate) vs. the original and still wildly popular UV-5R (which I refer to as the M16 of radios, as all the accessories you match it up with just plain work).<br /><br />Now you know the real background on these radios.f\\"" you want a \\""pretty\\"" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (or -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.

"The charger itself is fairly good. It's able to provide multiple charges to my several cellphones when I'm on the go. Problem is the connector. If you intend to use the connector that comes with the product, be ready for a big disappointment. Throw away the included USB connectors, it's useless.  Get a good USB cord from your favorite electronic store, the one that sits tight in your cellphone's charging port. Use it with this battery pack and you'd be set!",3,1
"The biggest problem with this rebuilt unit is it has some quirks that the new unit doesn't have. It tends to hag up when recharging, requiring me to reset the unit to get it working again. This happens 2-3 times a week. That is frustrating since I think it is fully recharging and find that it hung up before it was 1/3 to 1/2 recharged. If I were to do it again, I would opt for a new unit since SanDisk's rebuilding programs leaves something to be desired.<br />I've bought a number of rebuilt electronics and usually they are as good as the new versions. Unfortunately, this wasn't one of them.",3,2
"Not true high def, but pretty darn good for the price. Also not very sturdy and is sensitive to temp/humidity/gnat turbulence. Froze on first power up while setting the time; had to let it run out of battery. Has worked fine since then.",3,1
"I'm on my 4th of these DX5e models.  They serve their purpose for a basic TX and they are full range transmitters.  They are good value but of you fly often and trim often, the plastic trim tabs will eventually break in 6 months or a year.  The antenna also easily breaks so treat it like a fragile light bulb.  I keep buying them because the next model DX6i is $200 and I don't need 6 channels. For my slow GWS park flyers that I keep to within 100 yards, I use a Hobbyking 2.4 Ghz TX/RX that's 1/4 of the price of the DX5e packaged with RX AR600.  I have about 60 RC flying videos on Youtube - user ID theleabres.",3,1
It was o.k. but the nook would come out of the cover very easily  not very secure.  Plus it took way to long to be delivered. I actually forgot that I had ordered it.,3,2
The stero has no outlets to added more speakers. Very low quality. You get what you pay for I guess.,3,2
it charges my 5th generation iPod and the FM transmitter works good but one of the reasons I chose this product was because of the remote control which didn't work.  I replaced the battery in the remote and it still doesn't work.  it wasn't worth paying to ship the device to return it.,3,2
"As advertised, it easy to install, only issue I have at this time there needs to be a longer wire, for the transmitter to reach the inside of the cab of my truck, to get a clear signal to the monitor.",3,1

"I love the color, but it has been a little hard to work with it.  It says you can use the side volume buttons for volume, but not while the song is playing.  To just adjust the volume while it's playing it will instead fast-forward in the song.  I haven't been able how to get it to not do that and just do the volume......",3,2
"I've bought two of these so far. They worked fine. One lasted a 6 months and the other 4 months, both times with very intermittent use. When they become duds, they still power up but are no longer visible over Bluetooth. Don't expect reliability from an $8 part",3,1
"After the last Mp3 I bought, this is just wonderful. Sure, the buttons were smashed and tilted, selecting an option can set it to record, and the colour changes every time you press a button which is more annoying than I thought, but the sound is great, can be set to random, all that stuff.<br />It took about 2 1/2 weeks to arrive, so be aware. Other than that, it's fine. I use it to walk to work, and I have AAA batteries on hand for it.<br />I bought this mainly for the fact it can also double as a USB without bringing along a cord, which I strongly prefer.",3,1
"The size is perfect, but it came with two permanent stick-ons. Thought the description said one would not be permanent. Just not too sure if we want to put a permanent disk on our new car.",3,2
"I wanted the mic to be better.  I wanted it to pick up more baseline sounds. But, it gets the job done  for skype-to-skype calls.",3,1
It was ok,3,1
"I ordered this case for my Nook Glowlight because there were only clip on covers for the Glowlight at the Barnes and Nobles store which I thought would offer only minimal protection.  I figured that this case would do nicely due to the many great reviews.  Unfortunately, this case doesn't hold my Glowlight very well.  I have had the reader slip out of its case as I was pulling it out of my purse on multiple occasions.  Perhaps it works just fine for the Nook Simple touch, but for any one looking for a case for their Glowlight, I wouldn't recommend buying this one.",3,1
"I am a geek. I love to take things apart, which is why I opted to change my digitizer myself. Except that breaking the seal with the small plastic tool provided did not go so well. I ended up stabbing myself in the hand and being unable to type for a few days. I also ended up taking it for service and paying $50 to have it installed for me.  But it works lovely.",3,1
No manual and no online support.,3,2
This one is really nice but the foot is cracking already and its only been a few days 😢😭😭,3,1
"Mine works fine. Very small and looks like a second gen ipod shuffle. Songs tranfered easily with drag and drop in windows explorer. The problem is the audio output quality.. Its extremely tinny with the highs being way too loud and absolutely zero bass. I've used 2 separate earphones, one that came with an iphone and another pair of Sonys. Zero bass..",3,1
"No more support. Thanks Apple, no updates. No minecraft. My son is not happy. We can not update the ios to the latest version either.",3,1
"I bought this as a gift. But the wifi connection drops at times. My friend really likes how you can read and play games, but I might have to take it back if their internet keeps dropping the connection. But it does the job at a fraction of the price of a kindle.",3,1
"Ive had this case for over a month now and its still in working shape. The rubber tends to come off of the phone at times but its not enough for me to dislike it. The clear film that the phone comes with is alright. It gets dirty quickly and scratches are seen but it does its job. Over all, its a good buy if you want something to protect your phone quickly.",3,1
Worked as advertised but took forever on shipping,3,1
It may work but it is not the same. It is poorly made and is not a quick charger like the original Nook charger. I wouldn't buy it again.I'll buy original from B n N next time.,3,2
"Good for what it is used, that is going hiking and the gym, just wish that it would hold a charge longer.  It stated that it could hold an 8 hr charge but only gets about 4 hrs.  The video part does not work",3,1
"After reading stacks of bad to absolutely horrid reviews after I bought these phones, I was truly worried.  When they arrived, at my office, I immediately tried them.  In that environment they were really unusable.  So, I took them home with some real concerns.  I hooked them up in my planned bedroom environment, and was surprised that they work fairly well.  There is one position in which I get some interference, but mostly I get good sound.  I am keeping the phones, but really would have wished for something that \\""just\\"" works.  That isn't too much to ask for, is it?  Would I recommend these?  No!  There must be something that works better.  These Sony phones are just too marginal.  If there is nothing better, then I would look for IR phones before buying these.",3,1
I added this to my Excalibur AL 1950 as a deterrent. It takes some fine turing to get it right.,3,1
Satisfied customer,3,1
"Overall the mp3 player works fine. The setting is quite easy to understand and outside the water the sound is good. However, I had trouble in the water. I still have to figure out if it is a matter of how I set the earphone..the music do not come out on one side or it does only when I turn my head for breathing (while swimming of course)...In the package different sizes of earphone plugs are included so I will try a different size.",3,1
I purchased this mp3 for my niece she used it four or five days and loved it. She dropped it off the couch about 18 inches and the screen busted. It was great while it worked but it is very delicate do not drop it.,3,1
Audio only came out one speaker (right) and quality was poor. I don't know if the issue is my player or this product.,3,2
This case did not do it's job as some material was able to get into the case and the back side of the iPod has scratches because of that. It did protect the front side very well though.,3,1
Had to return because it was not working correctly with my 2008 A6's navigation even after numerous painful software upgrades. Previous and next would not work correctly no matter what I did with it.,3,2
"for the price it is a very nice case for my gps. as others have said its a hard shell thats pliable which is nice and has a wrist strap too. my problem is the fact there is no internal way of securing the gps and its just thin fabric inside. it would have been great if there was a little bit of foam inside for cushioning and/or a way to secure the gps. a quarter of a inch of foam in the top, bottom, and sides would would turn this good case into a great case and for very little more money. also the case came in a open plastic bag with nothing else. so no idea who is the maker nor even if the case is new or used or refabbed etc, i suggest only buying this if you need something cheap and temporary for your gps. once you can buy a better case as soon as you can.  edit: oh you will have absolutely no room for any accessories for your gps to be carried inside but thats fine.",3,2
"Its OKAY (for what its worth). Durable enough,and pretty easy to snap on, but taking it off is a different story. It's DEFINITELY not how I pictured it though.",3,1
"This is an alright radio. For the price it should be better than what it does. I ordered this radio from a dealer in the USA even though I paid a little more for it. The dealer &#34;Advanced Specialties Inc.&#34; is a USA dealer. The radio worked good for two weeks then stopped transmitting. I think the finals went out. I sent it back and right away he sent me a replacement radio.Very pleased with the response. Still testing out the second radio. This review could change.<br /><br />Pros<br />1.Yes, It does 10m/2m/70cm/6m but it has some flaws.<br />2. Great price for an almost duplicate radio of the Yaesu FT.8900 that will save you money<br />3. Love the Dual display can monitor U/U V/V U/V V/U<br />4. Crossband repeat is a great feature<br />5. Easy to program with the software<br /><br />Cons<br />1. Radio has an annoying 2 tone feature when in scan mode it stops on a frequency every time with the tone. You can.<br />Lower the tone but it is still loud and you can't turn it off even with the software<br />2. When ever you are scanning if one side is on a frequency with traffic on it, the other side scans with a &#34;popping&#34;  noise<br />in the speaker which makes the monitoring side virtually useless,<br />3. Speaker is very loud that makes the cover rattle. so you have to keep the radio at a lower volume if you don't want to hear<br />the speaker rattle.",3,1
"purchased as replacement for my RV Concertone - works well...it would have gotten five stars but:<br /><br />- doesn't have a subwoofer out.  Probably not important for most but my RV has a separate subwoofer in the ceiling (hmmm)...the cheap Concertone had a sub out...would have made wiring much easier if this had an optional sub out.<br /><br />- I don't know if any manufacturer has this, but I'd love to be able to play music on one channel (e.g., outside speakers) and be able to play a DVD inside and send its A/V to only one TV...more of a feature request than a ding on this unit.",3,1
"For some reason this CrazyOnDigital company is crazy enough to sell this item for 2 cents, and it's really about the right price for the cover itself. I found that I couldn't quite get it to fit because it was so flimsy. The corners would warp out and almost release my device. However, the velcro strap that comes with it is really great. Bottom line, I threw the cover away and kept the strap, which I'm sure I'll be able to use for something else. Really nice strap!",3,2
"Very impressed - quick and easy Bluetooth pairing.  Surprisingly full sound for its size.  Nice metal case with a good size rubber foot to keep it stable.  Got mine for $19.99 shipped w/coupon code.<br /><br />Update:  Going from 5 stars to 3 stars, because I'm experiencing the same Bluetooth connectivity issues that others have reported.  I'll send an e-mail to Aukey and see what they have to say.",3,1
"its really better than ok for the price. usually hard to find a dual band radio like this for under $100.00 but this one was well under that price, mmm  well ok i mean it isnt a ken wood of course. but yea i'd  recomend it for the price",3,1
"it works as advertised, screen is dark , hard to read, needs to be better contrasted, I used it to check miles walked or bike and had trouble reading screen.",3,1
"Did everything I asked of it, which admittedly wasn't a lot.  Used it as a looping sound effect for my haunted house).  Can't beat it for the price!",3,1
I got all of this for a great price! The only thing that I was dissapointed about was that the wall charger after 3 days just stopped working. It would not charge anything and it wouldnt even turn on. Other then that it was good!,3,2
"These cases are good quality material and the patterns (shooting stars etc) are true to their pictures. The only reason I gave it a 3 star rating was because the design doesn't have holes for the power/home or volume up/down buttons. You can adjust the volume, but it takes a lot of effort to do so. Other than missing this important detail, the cases fit fine.",3,2
"Seamless recording? I'm disappointed in this product because the results I receive are broken into about 2 min increments. For example I pass a truck on the highway. The first frame shows me behind it as the video ends. I start the next recording in sequence and I'm next to the cab of the vehicle. There is a time lapse of about 30-60 seconds. If something would happen during this time, it would not be collected on video. I find myself not having faith in the recordings since Im missing time. If im using it wrong please let me know and I'll be glad to change my rating.",3,2
It didn't so up on time and I am without a ipod because of the wait I am not too happy about that,3,1
"I live in a city of millions of people, drivers tend to be hyper-aggressive at all hours of the day.  I bought this camera for self-defense in case of a wreck.  I needed something that would have good facial recognition and the ability to record license plates.  This camera is functional under ideal conditions but wouldn't purchase it again unless they make the image quality better.<br /><br />The GOOD:<br />- Mounts well.  Sticks to the window or anything plastic.<br />- Operates well.  Comes on and begins to record immediately.<br />- Good size.<br /><br />The BAD:<br />- Worst feature...very blurry and out of focus except in ideal situations.  It seems to focus well on the dash and hood, but everything else is blurred.<br />- Even in daylight at 1080p it's barely able to record license plate numbers.  Usually I have to come to a complete stop directly behind a car to get it's license plate number.  At night &#34;things&#34; are visible but very blurry, license plates are unreadable.<br />- Tends to stop recording when full.  This sort of defeats its purpose.  I've had to reformat the disk during drives to get it to record again (this only takes seconds).<br />- The LED lights are VERY BRIGHT and distracting in the dark.  Don't put it anywhere near the driver's vision.  I blacked mine out with permanent marker and can still see them in the dark.  Needs smaller lights on the control side.",3,1
"I was looking for a cover for my Sony Reader PRS-T2, so I ordered this one. But I was fairly disappointed when I received this one. It is a bit fat, and it has a cheap look to it.<br /><br />It leaves all the functions of reader available, which is good. But when I put in my stylus, it doesn't close perfectly well. Furthermore, the leather of the cover is not very smooth; it has a 'slightly' rumpled look. Light brown color is good though.<br /><br />I had expected something better. But in the end, we only get what we pay for.",3,1
"I knew it was a wood laminate but after receiving it, it's a really cheap wood laminate.  I do like how bright and red the LCD display is and for the most part the iPod function works.",3,1
This case is nice and has enough pages to hold the advertised 520 discs. However the binder itself will not. If you try and put that many discs in the rings pop open and the pages spill out. In reality it will hold about half what the advertised capacity says. its ok but don't count on it holding what it says it will.,3,2
"Pros:<br />- Good sound and built quality<br />- BASS is there and it is surprising for the size of the speaker.<br />- It has FM Radio<br />- Bluetooth v3.0 comes with a nice female voice when you change modes<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Loud Freezing Noise when try to play next track on USb/TF Card<br />- Function buttons are small,flat and on the bottom of the unit<br />- No dedicated Aux-in Jack<br />- No dedicated Headphone Jack<br />- No USB Port (Only Mini)<br />- Talking Caller ID is slow to respond and announce (Only Numbers)<br />- When charging Red LED doesn't turn green to show charge is full<br />- No User's Manual to help figure out its very small 4 function buttons for different modes",3,2

Instead, I have white rubber silicone skin without any holes for the elastic armband and transparent hard cover case without the snap on option.

Usage:  Mostly just for hands free operation and listening to music on a walk or while doing yard work.      Review:  The mic seems to do a very good job - no complaints from anyone on the voice quality. The wiring is heavier than most I've seen so I'm hoping these are more duarable than some of the others I've had.   The ear wings are comfortable but I doubt they would stay in your ear for heavy exercising like jogging or running.  I would expect them to fall out due to the wiring pulling them down and out but I'm not a runner so take it with a grain of salt.   The music quality is just so-so and I expected better from a Bose and for this price.,3,1
"This product is appropriately priced...it was cheap and I liked that you got a \\""two-for\\"" with the stylus included.  It is definitely blingy and my daughter really liked it.  However, the case did not ever seam to snap in place correctly.  This is not the first blingy case like this that we've purchased and the others worked just fine.  Since my daughter wants a gel case we just ignored the fact that this one didn't work.  The stylus works great, no complaints there.  And none of the stones have fallen off and she's been using it for a few weeks now.  And the seller included extra rhinestones with glue at no extra charge which I thought was great.  I would recommend this product only because I've had cases like this before that worked great, I think the one I got on my last order was a fluke....not a reflection of the seller.",3,1
well this is just like the 401 but the 401 has some more settings so i would have to say i would go with the 401 and not the 301 but it is still a great peace of equipment. it still dose the job but when i bought both the 301 and 401 they were so close in price that it made more since to bye the 401 and well it was a dollar cheaper.,3,1
Plastic watches never last that long and rubber wrist bands ware even faster.<br />we sell want things to last right?<br />Nice idea.,3,2
"Wow, when I screwed the end cap off of the chain on the fob, it came completely off the end of the cable... exposing the bare end of the cable. So, the end cap and threads came apart from the end of the cable in one piece. Thank goodness they supplied a second chain coated in black with end caps/threads, (presumably as a second option), to use.<br />Other than that, I like the look of the fob. The Toyota emblem with that red fill looks very nice. The black coated chain actually looks better that the steel cable shown in the product photo.<br />I'd still recommend the product.",3,2
"The Nano cover is great for protection.  However, the screen protector does not stay down. The cover does allow my Nano to be individualized, by color. (Purple) The other 2 ordered were purchased for family and friends.",3,1

Holes for laces are too narrow you cant put most of the laces in it,3,2
"The watch is pretty good, but it has 2 major flaws that I can see. 1) it's kind of hard to get on by yourself, because you have to try and keep it tight and thread it under a band-holder at the same time, and it just takes some getting used to. And 2) there is no opening at the bottom of the case for the iPod's 30-pin connector, so every time you have to charge your iPod, you either have to take the iPod out of the watch case (which is not easy, I don't worry about it falling out AT ALL) or kind of fit the connector over the case and into the iPod.     I really like this case, it is wild to have an iPod on your wrist! It adds a lot of functionality to the iPod, and people will ask you what it is all the time, just because it's something that they haven't seen before and it's pretty cool.     I gave the case a 3/5 because I really do like the case, but it's flaws really bring it down. For the price, I definitely recommend picking one up to try it for yourself.",3,1
OK,3,1
"When I first got this it worked fine and then all of a sudden, perhaps two months later, it stopped working completely.  I have purchased a similar product at half the price at Dollar General to replace it.",3,2

"Althought the data cable seems to be of good quality, while trying to charge my dead Ipod it took the whole night and a couple of additional hours for it to get at its maximum, so nothing like the 2 hours of speed charge or 4 hours of complete charge stated by Apple when charging through the USB port of your computer. I think it should behave the same way if it was manufactured for this purpose.",3,2
"Very heavy rainbow effect after finish applying it, won't notice when the screen is on but it is annoying, not something I would expect for the price I paid.  Also the screen isn't exactly prefect fit, feel like cheaply made.",3,2

"My husband and I both have iPods & were looking for something that we could both use.  My husband really wanted it for the wireless FM transmitter and an armband.  The FM transmitter has a lot of static.  He doesn't really use it now; there is no point when you hear more static then the song itself.  We did get more accessories than what we were looking for so now we have a lot of junk laying around the house.  If you have more than 3 IPods, than I can see it be worth buying this package.",3,2
Works. I hardly get any volume. Might as well just use my phone,3,1
My ear-buds fit just fine in the case on the winder. Also I have a spare set of cushions. The case is hard and protects the ear-buds. I carry the case regularly. The only thing is the a small section of fabric has frayed a little. Which surprised me because the material and weave appeared pretty tough. I may have snagged it on something. Not a deal breaker.,3,1
"I did not want to pay $200 plus for itouch so we ordered this item.  I do what the product description says.  I believe mine was defective since the item was not responding the way I expected.  Tech support and refund process was excellent.  I would recommend for small children, but this is not going to be a replacement for itouch for sure.",3,2
The lameness is good but the mounting bracket is useless.,3,1
"The gadget looks cute (the interface is kind of cheesy, but  <br />it's a minor problem), but I couldn't really test it. It uses  <br />its own propietary format (ACT) to record voice, instead of  <br />MP3. The software seems to include a Windows-only ACT->MP3  <br />converter. Linux/FreeBSD fans should look for something else.",3,2
"sound quality wasnt as good as i expected it to be,<br />Used it as a back up if i cant find my other one.  Havent used it much.<br />Jell buds were uncomforatable and fall out all the time",3,1
"I really regret I ordered a UP-DOWN OPEN one. U can't put earphones on or charging when the its closed. And the color is little off. I got the blue one but the actually color is more like mint-green, which luckily I like, so it's not brother me much. Think twice if you really want this case. For this price, I think you can get a much better one.",3,1
"The quality it's ok, it has a red light that is always on, the sound it's ok but you can always listen static noise, I guess you obtain what you paid for, but if you are looking for a good mp3 player look somewhere else.",3,2
It is adorable but it doesnt cover my ipod like i thought it would. It really is just for decoration. I still love it because I am a big fan of Hello Kitty but I will have to replace it soon,3,1
"One thing that is very good about this case is that your Nook can breathe due to the little vent at the back bottom of this case.  I would think all the cases for Nook should have that.  No overheating possible.  But there are no pockets, it is not as rich feeling as the cover I had bought from Barnes and Noble.  But for the price, this case is GREAT.  I am going to give it to a new Nook user because I have gone back to my B&N case.",3,1
"I've been using this product for a week now and I just wanted to point out a few things:<br /><br />1. It does not last anywhere close to ten hours of playtime per a charge.<br /><br />2. Bluetooth pairing isn't great. The max volume would be lower than it actually is sometimes and I would have to reconnect to get to the max volume. Also, occasionally, there would be a buzzing noise that would not stop unless I reconfigured the connection.<br /><br />3. I didn't know it was 3x2 watt. I was looking for something a bit more.<br /><br />I did enjoy the clarity but ultimately the nuisances of having to reconnect to get to max volume and it not being loud enough overall turned me off from this product.",3,2
"They are easy to put on but do not provide a lot of protection, they are not real thick and are very soft. They do protect from scratches. A great buy for what I paid.  My daughter likes all the different colors.",3,1
Bought 2  .... Both didn't work!!!<br />Both have faulty headset contacts.<br />One has a faulty volume control switch.<br />could have been a problem shipping between<br />vender and Amazon...<br /><br />Returned for refund.<br /><br />I've changed my rating to 3 stars because of<br />the venders willingness to rectify the problem.,3,2
"I found this screen quite difficult to figure out and apply. I'm a bit disappointed I couldn't get a fairly large bubble out (tried using the smoother card included with purchase), but the bubble is on the edge of the device, outside the main screen area. The main screen area is nice and clear, so it's worked out pretty well in the end.",3,2
"It was okay but cant use it like it is. This is a black, solid black with no metallic or blue pearl or any other stuff just solid black. Wasn't their fault I don't guess but only giving a 3 star cause I still have to get it painted to use it,",3,2
"Works well receiving Kindle BUT display on TV is blurry!  Not HD clarity.  Defeats purpose of using to watch movies/ TV shows, etc.  That's disappointing!!!!",3,2
"Cheap, but it works!",3,1
"Bought on 12/3/10 for $16.95  I think the fit could be a litter tighter.This is thin rubber and doesn't add a lot of bulk to the very thin iPod Touch.  Will this protect a iPod touch from a 9 year old girl? probably not. Is it pink and cool? yes, that's what I'm told. I feel a reasonable price for this would be $3.99",3,2
"The charger does the job; it charges. Not as fast as the original charger because it's cheap, but hey, as long as it works.",3,1
I have purchased 3 of these for a friend of mine. The first one broke and the second one worked ok for awhile. The third one did not give the proper assist to blade opening which is the main reason you would by this model. To me this lowered my respect for the sog brand and I do not think I will buy anything else with it. I have noticed as more companies are having their knives assembled in China sog has gotten really cheap in the construction of its products. It seems they will put their name on anything.,3,2
easy hookup easy use  good sound,3,1
it does not have any holes for charger or headphones and the screen parts feel funny it gets hair stuck to it but i still use it in the pool,3,2
"It works pretty well, but I had a couple of problems:  First, I do not like the voice that always tells me loudly (in heavily accented, broken English) \\""Welcome to blu ... tooth. Connection is ready. Waiting for connection ... Connection is ready ... Connected.\\""  Then, when I am trying to stream music from my Mac through the speakers, I get breaks and gaps in the stream unless I actually use an audio cable. The unit's bluetooth won't keep up with the stream.",3,2
The case is and fits but it is hard to remove. Actually once you put it on dont try to take it off because it breaks.,3,2
"Great product, but being that the screen protector has a mirror finish it's hard to see the screen.  I bought this product for the mirror finish and protection, but prefer the regular screen protector.  Thank you!",3,1
"Pros:  The hot pink is a nice color.  Clip attaches to belt, etc.<br /><br />Cons:  Sometimes when I press the snap to close the case, the iPod turns on/off or the settings change.  Velcro would be better.  Also, I had a VERY difficult time getting the sticker residue off of the screen protector.  Now that corner of the screen protector doesn't stick to the screen well, and is scratched/blurry.  It would be better if the screen protector were built in/sewn to the case.",3,2
"The USB reader function on my product is dysfunctional. I've tried multiple USB drives and it refuses to read any of them. The reason I dished out extra money for this product opposed to a cheaper radio is because of the USB drive function. I'm terribly disappointed and feel like I've been cheated, scammed. Perhaps my specific radio was just messed up for a reason. A radio that reads USB drives is a great idea, if it works. The plan was to use this to listen to music at work. Guess It'll be another few boring weeks with only top 40 radio. :'(",3,2
This mount is very well made but the mount extension arm is way too long. It puts my GPS display right in my face so I can’t use it on my GM vehicle but that doesn’t mean it might not work better on another make of vehicle.,3,2
"I used mostly the car adapter and the wall adapter for the USB plug as well as the retractable cord. Feel very cheap but have never had any noticeable problem that seemed to be caused by these products. The cases were mostly useless though. Still got a good price for what I wanted at the time even though it came with extra junk that I didn't use, the price was so low it was cheaper even for just the parts I wanted than getting those parts separately or in smaller bundles.",3,1
"Small, pretty dang loud for its size, suction cup is a little weak so be careful where you attach it.",3,1
Well i kind of liked it. i was able to put music and pictures. The software that comes with the mp4 player does not work properly so i can put videos on it so that sucked about it. but over all alright.,3,2
Like others I saw the reviews and decided to take a chance on a relatively unknown brand. I received it quickly and was excited to try it. Here's the rundown:    Pros  -Pretty decent signal from FM Transmitter. I found a good station and got very minor static. I noticed I only get static when I use the iPod's internal equalizer. I turned it off and static went away.  -Holds iPod in an easy place to see it.  -Very inexpensive.    Cons  -Doesn't hold iPod Nano 4Gen tightly at all. I think it works best with bigger iPods like the classic or Touch. It barely sits in the cradle due to the placement in my car.  -Doesn't charge Nano 4Gen (a message on iPod says that charging isn't compatible with the device).  -Since the Nano doesn't sit tight it makes it a little hard to use the click wheel.    Overall I would actually recommend the car kit. I haven't tried the additional USB plug but think that feature is just secondary to what I've already mentioned. May not be the best for the new 4Gen Nano but for $10 it does a pretty good job and comparable to products over 10 times the price.,3,1
"heavy and cumbersome.  i whish i has sprung for the case with the built-in light.  nice bright light, but just not easy to use.  you get what you pay for.  advice:  get the case with the built-in light!",3,1
Handle the product with care.  The inards will pull out of the attaching end of the cord to your GPS unit.,3,1
MP3 player looks like ipod works ok and it is good to have. Downside is it needs a manual to be able to figure item out. Asked about the manual then the seller gets personal and tells me her life experience of amazon and how bad she needs this for money. I feel that the seller is unprofessional. Its just business.,3,1
Easy to load music...control button on face of mp3 could of been better made for finger control.  Hope the charge last for over 5 hours.  For the price; can't complain so far.,3,1
Didn't come with directions for wiring up the digital voltage read out,3,2
Great radio but it has NO Sirius connection. That really sucks!,3,2
"I bought this CD player for for my 1994 suburban, the CD player wouldnt play burned CDs, the turn dial FM selector is hard to use, and it doesnt have many functions.  I would reccomened spending a few extra dollars and getting something worthwile.",3,2
"Its ok, great buy . I use it for my passengers,  but yesterday i went up and flew to KPWA From KGOK and talking to okc approach and wpa ATC was difficult to hear. I was having a hard time understanding the numbers. But then again i am used to my zulu PFX , so for $100 these are a good buy , to use for passengers or as back ups, but i really would not recommend them for pilots flying into bravo charlie or delta airspace where you need to hear everything that approach departure or tower has to say",3,1
its ok,3,1
fader control knob broke immediately,3,2
"This case is a lot cheaper then what you buy in the store, so you can't expect it to be perfect.  I loved the color of it and it had a nice fit, but the hole where you would put your audio cable wouldn't wasn't large enough.  I couldn't use it in the car with this case which ruins it for me.  Bummer, otherwise it's a winner.",3,2
"It glitches when music is playing from the memory card. It skips to the next song in the middle of one. It doesn't do this when it is connected to a phone via cable. The memory card was tested on the phone as well and worked perfectly fine. I found no setting to fix this. But other than that, it's loud.",3,2
"I have a Garmin Nuvi and it attaches to this securely and seems to work ok in my vent on my 2012 Camry SE. So if you want to mount our GPS to an air vent this will probably work fine. My only concern is how the A/C now and Heat during winter will affect the GPS. In order to have a good view, i had to mount it on the air vent in the middle over my radio. Those air vents cannot be turned off so hopefully it will not make my GPS crap out. Had for about a month now and no issues yet.",3,1
Received on time without issue for a great price.  Cables are very stiff.  Rolled them up for travel a few times now and found a few crimps in the sheathing after unrolling but they are still working fine.  My worry is that cables will develop on open circuit after a few months of use.  Time will tell.,3,1
"The cover attaches to the nook simple touch (or glow light) via two plastic clips that fit into the notches in the top and bottom of the nook. Even though there are 4 notches on the nook, only two are used by the cover. It would be more secure if it used all 4 notches. There is no hole to reach the power on button on the back of the nook, so by using only 2 of the notches, it is possible to squeeze a finger between the cover and the nook to activate the switch. There is also a hard piece of plastic by the power switch so it is possible to push the back of the cover into the power switch to turn it on/off - if you know exactly where the switch is, because there is no mark on the case to show you where the hard plastic button is.<br />The part that folds is a bit large and soft. This means that when the cover is folded backwards to allow using the nook, the front of the cover does not align with the back of the cover and you have to make an adjustment every time you open the cover. The cover has a grippy surface so you can't just slide the cover to make it align - you have to separate the covers, align them, and then put the covers back together. Because of the grippy surface, the cover remains in place once you have it aligned.<br />In summary, it is an ok case, but it is unlikely that I would buy it again - instead, I would look for a case that fits better.",3,1
"This car camera is okay.It was inexpensive and I didn't expect great results.<br />But if you notice the drastic differences in the reviews and peoples experiences, you will understand that this camera is not a definitive item.<br />I seriously think that whatever shop in China is making these things, they just put in whatever components they have at the moment.<br /><br />I bought this specific item because a coworker bought it (2 actually) and the quality was pretty good.<br />I don't get near the detail in the image that he gets, and my lens is a basic one where his is actually fisheye, offering a wider field of view.<br /><br />So it is a crap shoot. You are really gambling with what you get.<br /><br />My quality is not good enough to read a license plate even if I am stopped at a red light really close to the person in front of me.<br />It is good enough to see the road so that if an accident happened, it would document where my car was and what I was doing at the time. You will be able to clearly see lights and such, so in my mind it is good enough for what I wanted it for.<br /><br />Quality as far as the overall item, it is fine. It doesn't feel like it will break. The display is what you would expect. The mount holds well. The power line is very lengthy and of decent quality.<br /><br />It does the job so I give it 3 stars. I'd give it 2.5 if I could. If I got one that was like my coworkers I'd give it a 4-5 star rating easily.<br /><br />Other thoughts:<br /><br />I actually like that you can set the camera to keep recording after power is cut. I figure if you were in an accident or something, you have a chance of capturing the interactions of the other driver as well.<br /><br />The night vision is garbage. It is essentially some LED lights that attempt to make it light enough for the camera to work. Unfortunately it just plain doesn't work, and the lights are seriously distracting while driving at night (and probably illegal as they are brighter than your dome light). Night recording without the lights is bad, but you'd expect that.Again, I just figure if it can track general situations that is all it is good for.<br /><br />You can't use high class micro SD cards in this thing. I use a Kingston 16GB class 4 card and have never had issues.<br /><br />Read the other reviews for anything I missed. They were fairly informative.",3,1
"Looks good, but of course these cases do not offer much protection. My son was happy though. That is all.",3,1
"Product ok for the price.  If anyone expects quality,  should pick a more expensive product.  When I was purchasing the items,  I was aware of it",3,1
For the size and price its worth it. Volume is difficult to control but the sound is good.,3,1
"This screen protector works but it is not great.  The main issue with it is that it is all around a little bit smaller than the display.  This isn't a huge issue as much as it is an annoyance; having the edges exposed allows for particles and \\""fuzzies\\"" to get stuck.  I'm also used to my iphone screen protector that fits so perfectly that you don't even realize it's there, so being able to see this screen protector lessens its visual aesthetic.  It also seems to kind of decrease the sharpness of the picture, but I think that's just something you trade off for the anti-glare.  I'll probably end up replacing it with a better, non anti-glare screen protector but for right now it's good enough to just give me peace of mind.",3,1
Thank you,3,1
"I was looking for something cheaper and not as flimsy as a Telex.  Got it cheaper on Ebay.  I give it 3 stars because the ANR is not the best.  I use it in a CRJ cockpit.  Although, I've only tried my coworkers DC pro x headset for a few minutes, so I don't have much else to compare it to.  The DC pro x was very comfortable and the ANR was much better.  The problem I find with the 250's ANR is that when the aircraft is flying fast (&#62; 250 kts), it doesn't block out the wind noise as well as I thought it would.  It blocks it out somewhat, but its still kind of loud for being ANR.  The CRJ is louder than some other jets I've been in though.  I also chose this one because its over the ear and not on it which I thought would be better for comfort and ANR.  The DC one I tried blocked out much more wind noise even though its on ear, but it also made a weird buzzing when it was close to the windshield which made my ear uncomfortable. It was almost too much ANR if there is such a thing.  The 250 does not do that. It does a great job of blocking out all the other fatiguing noises in the cockpit however.  I do not have to have the volume on my radios turned up so high anymore which is a relief, so the ANR is obviously working.  ATC is very crisp and clear as well as my intercom.  They are very comfortable and light weight.  I can wear them all day and not feel pain or pressure anywhere.  No problems with my sunglasses either.  Another con is the location of the battery compartment is awkward at the top of the ear cup where the arm for the headband is.  I've read that you have to take out at least one battery at the end of the day, or the headset may accidentally turn on and run down your battery.  So that's annoying too.  It does say its a general aviation headset, so it may do better there.  But I think some of the Bose I see people wear are too, so I don't know if it matters.  To sum it up, I am happy with it, but not in love with it.  I'll keep it for now and my next purchase will be something with a better ANR that blocks out more wind noise.  The other aspects of the ANR are great, coms are crisp and clear, and best of all, it is lightweight and comfortable.  If you don't want to shell out a grand for the high end stuff and get a good value for your dollar, this is the headset for you.",3,1
i just purchased this amp and did not realize it does not have a subwoofer channel. I hope i can use it.,3,2

"This works great as a battery backup, but not as a solar charger. I've had it out in the sun on backpacking trips, in the car, and even in the window of my apartment. I'm not sure it's charged at all. If it has, it's so slow that it's not helpful away from a power source as a solar charger. I have charged it completely a few times before going on weekend trips. Then it gives me enough juice to recharge my iphone a couple times. It's worth it for that for what I paid for it, but bulky and heavy as a battery backup if the solar panels are useless.",3,1
Ok,3,1
"Didn't exactly fit my tablet but i it did the job for the most part.

"I really wanted to like this unit as I purchased it as a replacement for an iHome iP9 that had failed.  Unfortunately, though sound quality is improved, the sensitivity of the FM tuner is much reduced from that of the iP9, with a favorite distant station of mine not coming in at all on the iA91. Further, the sound quality of the AM tuner is substantially muffled as compared to the iP9.  In short, I'll be returning my iA91 and purchasing another \\""new old stock\\"" iP9.",3,2
"I installed these in a 2003 F-250. These plates have nice mounting holes, and they are certainly sturdy, but I have one major complaint. Once you have the speaker screwed into the bracket, and go to put the bracket into the door, you might find that the screws holding the speaker into the bracket prevent the bracket mounting holes from lining up with the OEM holes in the door. I tried all different orientations, sliding the speaker around on the bracket, but it won't even come close. Its maybe 3/4\\"" off. The screws prevent you from moving the bracket down low enough to get it lined up. I ended up having to cut notches into the door to make it fit. I wasn't really excited about doing that, but it did work.",3,2
they are okay for the price. would recommend anyways. I bought this two for my dad and he liked them cheaper than a custom box.,3,1
"With a phone cover,  the cable has to be pushed to fit.  I would not purchase again unless i did not use a cover",3,2
"The screen protector applies pretty much the same as any other screen protector out there. It can be fussy to get perfect. It does defeat the non glare screen of the Kindle. I guess the biggest question to ask is, which is more important no glare screen or protection?",3,1
"My title says it all: my Directed Electronics Car Add-On HD radio is a mixed bag - here's several examples:<br />THE GOOD: IF you are in a local, strong FM-HD signal area, then HD radio audio is decent, and you can receive an additional HD2 channel too!  It seems like it is trying to decode analog AM stereo too - which would be a great feature, but it's not listed.<br />THE BAD: To receive AM-HD, you need a VERY strong signal.  You have to be in the city where the AM transmitter is, or have a non-directional 50KW AM station to receive HD-AM; even at that, the HD-AM audio is a little raspy, and 'esssy' with voice-only stations.<br />THE UGLY: No way to switch to only analog AM or analog FM; if a station has their analog delay off, and your signal goes back and forth from analog to digital, it will drive you nuts hearing the same thing 5 seconds later, or before (it did me, for a fireworks music show).<br />THE GOOD: Nice display unit, and it shows FM analog stations' RDS information in the display that have RDS.  Also, you CAN receive analog AM stations okay that were wiped-out by digital buzzing (20KHz off-frequency) from an HD-AM station on your regular radio.  Excellent FM SELECTIVITY (meaning you CAN pickup an FM station just one channel away that you can't hear very well on your other regular FM radio.<br />THE BAD: Digital AM audio not as good as I expected, and only 1 station of 6 AM-HD stations here has stereo audio.  No analog stereo indication for AM or FM.  No stereo/mono switch.  Poor AM sensistivity.<br />THE UGLY: You can almost fry eggs on the hot metal tuner module.<br /><br />Anyhow, that's my opinion - it's close, but not quite yet; maybe they'll nail-it on an updated model.  My guess is that an updated model WILL be worth the money, so ask them to make it for you!",3,1

"I gave this product 3 stars because for the life of me I cannot get the black part to \\""snap\\"" into the pink part. It's just the slightest bit too small for my Ipod Touch (I own a 3rd Gen). I have tried to push it together fairly hard and no such luck.  Other than this product defect, it is really nice. The black part stays on well, so it's not a 'real' issue that it doesn't snap. I have dropped my Ipod a few times at the gym and it has not come apart.  The plastic is very thick and of good quality. I would definatley purchase this again considering the cheap price!",3,2
"The unit does exactly what it claims to which should get it four stars.Sadly the short,poorly constructed cable that comes with it lasted 4 charges prior to the case breaking apart at the charge end and had to be repaired,that's ok at home but pretty useless when travelling.

"I have an ipod 3rd Generation and the ipod case is way to big for the ipod. When I closed the case on the ipod the ipod rattles around inside the case. Also another annoying problems is that becasue of this I can't click the volume buttons without taking the case off. Also, the opening at the top for the standby button is on the wrong side so I can't click the standby button either without taking the case off. The reason I gave three stars it that it still is super cute and the stylus is a nice add on. It's just annoying. I am considering sending it back.",3,2
The case fits well and has all the openings necessary to link your zen to the computer.  Downside - no top opening to access volume - you need to open the case to adjust. The quality of the clear plasting inside is heavy but scratched.  A little disappointed.,3,1
It seems like it would be good but the description doesn't say if it has a screen protector. I heard that the nano scratches easily so you have to have a screen protector.,3,1

He selects not to leave a message and tells me Square Trade will call me later (which they dont.)<br /><br />Here I am many days later, they never called. Sure I can call them but I have been very busy. Why do I need to hunt them down?<br /><br />Anyways, the beef and potatoes here is the warranty is probably worth it, I was told by the installer replacing the display (which is the only part left to replace) would have cost me just as much as theTV did. So for the money it makes sense. However service and logistics, leaves far too much to be desired.<br /><br />If and when I actually get my TV fixed I will post an update and perhaps move my review to \\""its ok\\"", we will see...<br /><br />UPDATE: Ok so they never called me, I called them. They looked up and saw the part I needed was no longer available and gave me just about enough cash to get a new TV of same size, and tech features. The check came quickly and I thought it was fair. I boosted the rating to 3 stars. I would have given it 4 or 5 stars but I had to keep chancing them after the set period of time would elapse with no call backs.",3,1
"Product as advertised.  A bit too slippery inside, to suit me -- So, be careful when taking out your device.  I believe other, less expensive, products would serve just as well.",3,1
👍,3,1
the color is alright but i dont like it at all feels like cheap leather and it juss no9t what i wanted,3,1
It's ok...it just do what I wanted it to do.  The description was not clear.  I did bother to return it and it just sitting in my glove box.,3,2
"It's very well constructed and sturdy. I like the rubbery coating. It connects easily via Bluetooth and I had no problems with the Bluetooth range. Where it did lack for me is in sound quality. Although the sound is clear, with minimal distortion, I really didn't think that it sounded much better than a somewhat decent clock radio. The tonal range just wasn't there. For the price, I was hoping for a bit more in the lower frequencies. It comes with a USB charging cable, a mini stereo plug and a nice carrying cover. There is also a notice in the box to not charge the unit with a tablet charger (2.0 Amp, I'm assuming), but use a cell phone charger or a PC USB instead, otherwise you could damage the battery. It also says that it has a microphone for hands free telephone use, but I didn't test that, so I have no opinion either way.<br /><br />I kept it for three weeks, listening and debating whether to keep it or not, but in the end, I decided I couldn't justify the price for the sound quality and returned the unit (thank you Amazon for your generous return policy). I went to a local store and listened to about 10 different Bluetooth speakers and decided on the Jabra Solemate. It's on order now from Amazon.<br /><br />I will say though that, IMHO, the sound quality is on par with many more expensive systems.... but to my old ringing ears, the Jabra just sounded better.<br /><br />Please don't misunderstand me, it's a nice, well made product that is easily on par with other speaker systems and has plenty of volume, it's just my personal listening preference leaned more towards the sound from the Jabra. I don't listen to music real loud and I don't need or expect it to fill a room, I just want a nice sounding system I can connect to my tablet and listen to.",3,1
Pretty awesome but the flaws I had is that during the day outside I couldn't see my screen at all. Like not even a little. And with my Starbucks rewards app i had to take it off in order for the lady to scan my ipod. Because the scanner couldn't detect the scan so I can get a free drink. So depending how u use ur I pod like if you need it to make payments and someone needs to scan it this probably won't be a good idea. Still this is a pretty cool concept,3,1
"This case came exactly as described.  It looks fabulous and my son loved it but it was very hard to fit the ipad into.  We had to leave the case in front of the fireplace to heat up the plastic, three times before it fit the ipad.",3,1
"This product only works plugged in one way, so you have to watch to make sure it is charging when you plug it in.  The quality is definitely after market, so don't buy it expecting it to perform like Apple accessories.  Even so, for the money the product is okay.  You won't feel cheated, but won't feel like you made a great buy either.",3,2
"Works for what I wanted, but it retains a lot of sweat. Pretty gross. It also likes to slide down my arm over time.",3,1
I bought this for someone and I think the Armband is going to be a bit tight but it'll do. Everything else is pretty good so far.,3,1
"This is a great price. I bought my nano used and it didn't come with a charger, so this was a good price for just something that will charge it. But it's frustrating that I can't listen to it while charging it. Also when syncing to itunes, I often get an error, which is 99% likely due to the cord. Still a good price and it does charge.",3,1

"I know this is a Baofeng UV5R in a base station enclosure.  However, it is neat, and I would find it very useful as a base station.  I wish this seller would offer it for around $40 or $50 which would be the fair price.<br /><br />For those barking about FCC, go chase your tail.",3,1
"We bought these for my son and my niece.  They fit the iPod touch 4G well, but don't seem to stick that great.  We put one on my niece's and it went on better than my son's.  We went through three of them on my son's iPod and finally just gave up.  Couldn't get it to stick very well.  I have a different type on my iPod that I've had on it for a year, I don't think these will last that long.  The finish on them turns your iPod into a mirror when it's off, so that's a nice feature.  Just wish they would stick better.",3,1
works well but the fan in it gets annoying. however it can charge alot at once so im happy with it.,3,1
"Good quality. Dimensions as described; the width fits the Garmin 3597 perfectly, but the hight is too big for this device. This case is best described as suitable for generic 5&#34; GPS. Will have to put padding to prevent the device from being loose inside case. The case is sturdy for packing in travel. Screen protectors do not cover entire screen of the 3597 device",3,1

"Got this for my lil' cousin. She loves camo, and was really excited to get it. After only a few short weeks, the scene started to wear and fade off of the case. I've gotten 3 cases for the price of this one, that I've had for quite some time, and are still in great condition, in comparison! For the price, the quality is not there! Prepare yourself with this purchase.....the scene won't last long, and is not worth the extra cost!",3,1
"Pros:  1. Ability to open multiple format of e-book (BUT... see the cons below)  2. light weight  3. reasonable price  4. touch screen    Cons:  1. GLARE!!!! very annoying (as everyone has said!)  2. CANNOT open different format in the same machine (if you have more than one format in your collection at the same time). E.g. if you put EPUB and PDF e-books together in your machine... you will be able to open only one type of files... the others will appear \\""PROTECTED FILE\\"".

"And you can tell.... On two of the metal tools, there is surface rust. I do not know how this product is stored, but it was not in a totally dry container.

"I could quickly place my iPod onto the unit and choosing channels was easy.  The ratcheting screw mechanism to hold the iPod at a certain angle, broke easily, so I had to use a quick-tie to hold the unit in place.  Each time car is started, the unit needs to be manually turned on as well; otherwise you will get high-volume static over your sound system.",3,2
"You can tell they had some considerate people putting this thing together.  But you can also tell they weren't expecting to sell many of these if they didn't keep the price down by cutting some corners. <br /> <br />Disadvantages: <br />1) Constant static, esp. noticable during quiet parts and transitions between songs. <br />2) Feels flimsy, cheap plastics. <br />3) A little fatter than a common USB drive. <br /> <br />Advantages: <br />1) All functions work competently and it is highly customizable. <br />2) Quality is consistent, not necessarily stereo-quality sound, but sounds like radio. <br />3) Little things that show they cared:   <br />    Nice navigation system.   <br />    Fades out when you skip a song instead of stopping abruptly <br />    Recording ability extended to FM radio <br />    shut down and recording timers  (if you want the player to wake you up after a few hours, or if you want it to record a certain radio talk show for a certain amount of time) <br />    Clock <br />    Phone book <br />    Customizable scrolling txt files for song lyrics <br />    Lanyard ready ring at end <br />4) Cheap <br />5) Hasn't broken yet. <br /> <br />I personally like the texture of the mp3 player, a kind of velvet like plastic. :-)",3,1
"Perhaps I'm biased because I recently bought my mother (who has the exact same phone) an OtterBox case for Christmas and there is an obvious difference when it comes to quality. When comparing the two side by side, the silicon for the LiViTech definitely feels softer and flimsier, although it's a much prettier color when compared to the basic black of the OtterBox. As a matter of fact, the whole case (to include the plastic housing and built in screen protector) definitely seems like a slightly lesser quality. Then again, I did pay slightly less. My biggest complaint, and something that I wasn't expecting in the slightest, was that when I pulled the case from the packaging it came in, the protective screen already had minor scratches on it, as well as someones fingerprints! Again, it's not something I would have expected from a case labeled as &#34;new&#34; but I'm not the type to call and complain over something relatively minor. Not to mention I had already trashed my other case so I just grabbed some Windex and wiped it off the best I could.<br /><br />As far as functionality is concerned, it works alright. Sometimes it's hard to select icons that run across the bottom of the screen, such as the home button, but I think it's just the way the screen protector attaches into the plastic case. Also, I have to press a lot harder than when I had just a plastic stick'em screen protector, but that's somewhat to be expected switching to the built in. Another thing, although it's supposed to be able to protect your phone in the event you drop it on accident... I'm not so sure this whole thing wouldn't simply pop apart and manage to leave your phone damaged. Eh, at least it looks cute right?",3,1
I bought it and my friend liked it so he bought it from me...seeing that after I purchased this my sister crashed my car,3,1
"The case fits perfectly (Ipod Touch 4th Gen) and is very slim, but since it is plastic it will only protect scratches and dirt. You'd better not drop your Ipod on the ground because this case is useless for such protection. Well, you get what you paid for.The screen protector does it job and there's no scratch at all on the Ipod screen although there are lots of scratches on the protector. I guess that's why they give you a lot of screen protectors...you will have to change it!...and within a short time.  The stylus is pretty useless, I threw it away as well.",3,1
"This is a good little player.  As Creative Labs no longer sells mp3 players, was on a mission to find a player that is both compatible with my library's Overdrive in order to download audiobooks and that also has bookmarking features.  Will be honest, only have used it in light of that feature (not the camera, video, etc.).  As the audiobooks download each disc in an audiobook as one long track, the capability is needed to be able to stop in the middle of a track and be able to find the same spot.  This has both of those capabilities.  Controls are a little awkward at first, but got used to them.",3,1
"For its price The Creative Muvo is a feature-rich, 2GB MP3 player: nice sound, built-in mic, a variety of settings controls, bass boost, etc. But that's about where it ends! These compact units are skitish and tend to have \\""memory-drop\\"" problems. The flimsy plastic cover for the battery compartment (specifically the \\""tab\\"" that holds the cover in place) is...well...a flimsy bit of poor engineering. (I broke one off once and Creative was \\""good enough\\"" to sell me a replacement battery cover for $11, about 1/5th the retail cost of the entire unit!) Recently, the outdoor temp. went down to 26 deg. F. and I had left my Muvo in my car overnight -- big mistake! The next day the unit was stuck in the ON-only mode, totally unplayable, and I had to remove the battery completely to power the unit off. Like most all MP3 players the unit does not hold hundreds of tunes: even at 2GB you'll be lucky to load 375 songs before you run out of space. In fairness, however, all MP3-player makers -- including even the venerable iPOD -- make the same inflated claim, omitting the facts that today's music is often quite lenghty, and there's no accounting for the bitrate of one's downloads. Hence the Muvo -- like any other MP3 player -- stores what it can store and that's it! Don't expect more than that. But I suppose my biggest gripe goes back to its total lack of reliability and durability. These brittle players are virtually made of \\""crystaline glass\\"" and you'd be well advised as to how you treat the unit, and under what conditions, if you venture down the Muvo path. The Muvo is by no means a \\""ruggedized\\"" device. Its sound is great, and it has some great built-in features and nice technology. But if it freezes over night...if its flimsy plastic battery cover break...or something else, then of what use are all those neat built-in bells and whistles?! As I entitled this review: the Muvo is only as good as its low price, which takes one back to that time-honored adage: you get what you pay for, nothing more!",3,2
"I need a small inverter for a car trip we are taking in a few weeks.  I went cheap with this $20 version since it appears to have the same specs (50 Hz, 130W peak, general size) as the more expensive Duracell model.  My suspicion is that Duracell may just be selling a repackaged version of this unit.<br /><br />It arrived yesterday and I tried to plug in a few items.  The slots are slightly too far apart for US style plugs - they don't fit!  Forget about plugging in something with a ground, no way.<br /><br />Luckily I have some international converters.  I plugged one into the angled slots (I think these are for China) and now it works fine.  The converter is narrow enough that my grounded plug fits as well.  Don't think of ordering this unless you have a spare converter.",3,1
"Claims of Full HD Resolution is a bit of stretch. The units I received were not HD. Also, in one of the pics you can see a HDMI slot which is nowhere in the units that arrived.

This was a Christmas present that while had great potential...fell flat.  Looks great and iphone doc works well.  Sound quality is nice BUT the CD player does not work.  So now i have to pack it up return it and go without a stereo for several weeks.  Ho ho ho,3,1
Works good but you have to hold the off button for 5 seconds to get it to work. You can find better for the price.,3,1
"Needs some work.    The strap is too long for me and with the tiny patch of velcro at the very end, it is hard to use.    The case itself holds my ipod ok, I'd have made the back around the slots where the strap goes through a bit stiffer / sturdier and marked where the buttons on the ipod are located underneath the case though.",3,2
Im dissapointed in the design.  Its just not fluent or easy to use at all. The way the blade lock are not 100% the way the tools lock makes it impossible when u have work gloves on to unlock the tool to sheath it.  And the tools jave some weird cover on them thats a pain to remove and serves no purpose that I can find.  However it does seem to be solid and sturdy. Bc of that it get 3 stars but I will go back to gerber.,3,2
"This is a cute case, and it's very protective, however, the zipper sticks when going around the corners and you have to back up and try to zip again.  I'm afraid it will eventually break.  If I had tried it out in a store before buying, I probably would have passed it by.    I use it for my tiny Western Digital My Passport.  NOTE:  It's better to put the Passport in the netted side pocket and leave the cord in the main section.  It has a tendency to fall out of the main part and actually fits better in the netted side pocket.",3,2

"Absolutely LOVED this when I got it, & used it incessantly until the cord, which is both the charger & connector, started to short-out. I was able, for a week or two, to manipulate the cord &#34;JUST SO&#34;, then manage to CAREFULLY KEEP the cord(s) in the EXACT POSITION & still use it, until, of course, it shifted, got bumped, etc, then would stop playing, so it was BACK to &#34;TWEAKlNG&#34; the cords TRYING to find the EXACT POSITION to get it to play again.  Naturally, over time, it was harder & took longer to find the &#34;sweet spot&#34;, until NONE EXISTED. I guess, for the price, it was worth it, but, unless the Company starts offering &#34;FREE REPLACEMENT CORDS&#34;, I'm gonna be purchasing a DIFFERENT speaker.",3,2
"I received my case today exactly 4 weeks after ordering it.  The picture shows that it's red inside and it's not.  The case I received is actually black inside with white stitching.  There is an inside front pocket ( to slide a note or two) that the picture does not show but there are 2 sd card pockets.  The thing that bothers me is that the closure is on the front and folds over and actually closes in the back, which means that the case does not sit flat on a table. The reader slides down into the top but the top and side of the case that hold the reader in place are not as wide as shown, so they kind of bow out and don't lay flat against the front of the reader.  This may take some getting used to, but for the price of $17, it will serve it's purpose.  I also won't attempt to send it back to the UK for a refund.  ***UPDATE***  I did contact Navi-Tech and expressed my concerns about the case not being as shown and how the sides were bowing out.  They asked me for pictures which I sent and as of 1/12, they informed me that I must have gotten the wrong case or a defective one and have since mailed out a new case to me and said that I would receive it within 6 to 10 days.  Their customer service was great with responding to my concerns. The also advised me to keep the original case.  I had asked if they would send me a return envelope to return it to them but they said that it would be too expensive.  I will repost when I receive the new case.",3,2
"I bought this because I wanted something portable to play my ipod out loud. The design is adorable, and if I'm not wrong, there are more color choices. Sound quality is not exactly the best... if you turn up the volume too high on your ipod (or any mp3 player) the sound starts getting staticky. Another good thing is that you dont need to buy replaceable batteries! It is rechargeable and comes with a usb to charge through your computer. If you are looking for sound quality.... I dont suggest this product for you, but if you need an inexpensive (portable) external speaker this is good!",3,1
"Fit my Saab 9-2x Aero perfectly. Picture is okay but seems overexposed in all lighting situations, the screen is really white looking, making it difficult to see clearly.

For $20 it's a good enough camera that provides a very clean looking install.",3,1
"Good product that offered me great reception in Philadelphia and the suburbs, but struggled to tune in anytime I was in center city. The device was easy to set up and satechi sent me an extender arm for my unit free of charge since the device would not originally fit in my car. I found though that the arm broke easily and the device would not stay upright after a few weeks unless I lodged it under my dash. After i tired of this product I decided to buy a new car stereo which has been so much more convenient. I would recommend this option to anyone as the difference in price is trumped by the difference in convenience.",3,1
"I have a lot of battery hungry devices like the Apple iPhone 4,  android mobile phone, my personal media player (PMP) which I use to play videos. Apart from that my wife's mobile phone and the HP Touchpad tablet. We usually carry all of these if we are going somewhere. The main problem which one faces is that any of these devices can run out of battery. This is the main reason i decided to get a battery pack and after checking out various options available on amazon and various reviews that i read, i decided on the IMP 70D.<br />The IMP 70D charges my two cell phones simultaneously and also charges my tablet when connected to the 2.1 A USB port.<br />The two different USB ports are really great as they enabled charging of multiple devices.<br />I think it can charge my android phone thrice over with its 7000mAh battery.<br />My PMP is quiet old and cannot hold much battery charge so i had sort of stopped using it but with this battery pack, i can keep the player On full time while watching videos as i keep the IMP 70D connected to the PMP.<br />One feature i like about this battery pack is the automatic shutoff function which saves unnecessary draining of battery power. This is true if the device is charged full or if the device is disconnected.<br />Another thing i like about the IMP 70D is there is no need of a dedicated AC charger to charge the battery pack itself. Just use the bundled cable to charge it.The cable comes with two connectors for micro USB and mini USB which i guess are generous for most needs.<br />I would have loved if they even included an iPhone connector adapter.<br />All in all an excellent product that works to the T.<br /><br />Edit (22-Mar-2014) - Although i am editing this review very late but i started facing this issue since 2013 start. My iPhone would not charge using my default iPhone cable but it only works with its own black small wounded cord. Also even using their own cable, i cannot charge the iPad 2 even when I use the 2.1A port.Also i feel it is not holding the charge as much so i might probably not buy a new trent product again.<br /><br />Knocking off 2 stars from my review.",3,1
"Was impressed when I first see the product, test it in the range come to find out that the laser's adjustment screw fell out, not able to adjust the light and now useless.",3,2
This little speaker is good for the purpose it was designed. This should be used as a portable speaker when you are in a spot where a larger speaker system is not available. I found it to have good tone for it's size. The pop up added bass feature is what makes this a good sounding speaker. Without the added feature it is marginal at best.,3,1

"This charger/FM transmitter is easy to use and works as advertised. The charger works great and the cord makes the devise easy to manage.  The sound quality of the music received on the car stereo is \\""acceptable\\"" if playing a song from ipod but \\""poor\\"" if you're trying to listen to an internet service like Pandora. Overall it's a cheap and easy way to hear your songs on the car stereo but don't get any ideas that it's a great solution to listen to Pandora in your car instead of your local radio stations.",3,1
"I like how i can finally listen to music in my car, but its always a tiny bit fuzzy. is that a problem with my car stereo or this product. Otherwise i like the style and it seems to hold up pretty good, being that im a bit clumsy sometimes. Overall, you get what you paid for.",3,1
** Update to my earlier review. Once I actually got a person on the phone they were very helpful. They are sending us a new unit and as long as this one actually works I will be happy.  while it is a great price the manual is useless and my husband who is very tech savy had trouble with the installation. no matter what he did the screen stayed black and it so far has been a very expensive dome light. I am a bit frustrated with the company because they seem to be unapologetic about the issue and want us to just send it back. we needed this for a long car trip for the kids and now it looks like i will either have to fork over the dough for a new one upfront or go without. the unit is pretty and a great price but the company gets a D- for service and quality.,3,1
"The Sony Ereader I have is wonderful - and I recommend some electronic book for any reader or person who waits for kids, in airports or in doctor's offices.  I do not, however, recommdend Sony as a brand because their web site to purchase books is very user UNfriendly.  If you can't scroll to see the prices in your cart, oh well.  If you write for help, oh well.  If you want a refund on gift cards you can not use, oh well.  The call center help is very nice but Sony as  company is well insulated and unhelpful.  They  maintain once they have your money in any form, and whether you have spent it or not, they have it period.  Finally, and this is potentially very scary - you can't get your credit card number removed from their site.  I tried it, then went back to see if it was removed.    The product is very good but customer service lasts the life of the item, and customer service is very bad.",3,2

I don't know how much it is going to last, I hope that it will be enough to justify the inversion that I made. <br /> <br />Leaving that aside, I think that the skin is great, suits excelent and improves the handling of the buttons next to the ring which are difficult to press otherwise.",3,1
The product came on time that was great but the usb cable only works for the power wall charger so you cant use it on your computer at all. Also when im using my phone my phone glitches a little only when im charging it but overall I loved how cheap it is and how it gets the job done.,3,1
"It doesn’t really matter which “brand” name you see this little dashboard cam listed under here on Amazon.com, they are all the same. You get a front camera with a small LCD screen to view the action and see the menu options, a rear view camera, USB cord, Power cord, suction cup and adhesive attachments and a remote control.<br /><br />The cables are plenty long enough to set this up and hide the cables in a standard car (not sure about an SUV).<br /><br />The cameras are cheap plastic units that feel like they could be easily broken. They do rotate so that you can try to get the best angle/view.<br /><br />The instructions are pretty much useless as is the remote control. I found the remote only works to turn the unit off/on, which you do not need since the unit starts with your car and shuts off after the car power turns off.<br /><br />There is NO infrared (IR) ability, even though it is advertised as such.<br /><br />There is supposedly an internal battery, if there is it lasts less then 5 minutes.<br /><br />The unit will not overwrite the files as the instructions say. You actually have to swap out, reformat or empty your SD card when it is full. Otherwise the unit will get in a loop of turning on and immediately turning off (which makes it hard to format the card in the unit at that point.<br /><br />My rear camera kept falling off the window. Adhesive stuck to the window but the camera came away from the adhesive. Had to glue the camera to the adhesive that was still on the window to get it to stay.<br /><br />This does not record in HD. Video quality is often spotty and unfocused. I have had clear results and very bad results with choppy footage and frozen frames.<br /><br />I have mine set for 5 min record time but it will not record more than 1 minute at a time no matter what I do. Sometimes it does not even record at all (missing footage when I go back and review my drive).<br /><br />For the price I will keep it until it dies completely. While I have not had to rely on the footage for any accidents it has captured some of the idiots out there on the highways.<br /><br />It also messes with your radio reception.ave not had to rely on the footage for any accidents it has captured some of the idiots out there on the highways.<br /><br />It also messes with your radio reception.",3,2
"the screen saver was hard to get the air bubbles out. they need to put a small flat piece of plastic in it, so you can squeeze the air outas some other saver have. if it went on easier it would have been great.",3,1
"I adored this case when I first recieved it. I am an animal print lover. Zebra is my favorite pattern. The case seemed sturdy at first. It has two layers to it, a hard shell and a rubberized coating. The rubberized coating ripped after 2 weeks. It ripped near the opening for the charger. It was a lovely product, but it did not last.",3,2
None of the edges were rolled leaving most of them razor sharp. I had to put on leather gloves to assemble it and put it on my bike. Works well enough other than that. I have no worries that it will bend or break.,3,1
the case was in good condition. My light didnt work and the bottom piece that you clip on to another surface was way to big. love the headphone small and neat.,3,1
"The items broke the first time we used them.  I left a poor review for the product, not the distributor.  After reading my review I was contacted and have received a replacement for the broken items.  I appreciate the immediate attention this was given and would order from this distributor again.  This is true Customer Service.",3,2
"for a 2nd Gen iPod touch this skin literally just fit, it was initially so tight it was holding the power button down so it was constantly trying to turn itself off.  I had to put it in some boiling water (inside a bag without the iPod in it) to get it to stretch out enough to stop it from holding down the power button.  Otherwise it's a decent case, it looks close to the picture, although the dark purple is see through not a solid color like it shows.<br /><br />So I gave this case a 3 Star review due to it not showing what the product is, a see through case, and for it's lack of a quality fit,  It's okay, but not great, even at this price point there are better options.",3,2
"While this vacuum isn't nearly as powerful as the ones at the gas station or a larger shop vac, it is handy and gets the job done. It is much easier than dragging a large vacuum and extension cord out to your driveway or dumping all your loose change into the gas station vacuums every week.<br /><br />It does a great job picking up small debris from my carpet like crumbs, dirt, and grass. If your carpet is very dirty, you may find yourself going over the same area multiple times to get it clean whereas a more powerful shop vac could do the same job in one pass. It also had a little trouble picking up animal hair that was stuck in the carpet.<br /><br />The pointed extension piece is nice for getting into tight spots but I really wish it came with a brush extension to help loosen pet hair.<br /><br />For the price, I would highly recommend this for cleaning up small messes without having to drag out a big vacuum and extension cord or make a special trip to the gas station/ car wash. If you have pets, kids, or live in an area where your interior is more susceptible to dirt, you are going to want something a little more powerful.",3,1
music not as clear as my older version bought years ago,3,1
"I've had the product for several months ... with only a single problem.  One day the inverter stopped selling excess power back to the grid - even though all the settings appeared correct.  The solution?  Reboot the inverter.  Yup, it's a computer - and apparently it needs to be rebooted every so often.  That is definitely a serious mark against it.  I used another brand, a TRACE 4024 inverter for 18 years - and never had to 'reboot' it.  So, in all honesty, I'm a little disappointed.  Also, the user-interface to this Outback product - leaves a lot to be desired.",3,2
"Plug was wrong, it did not work properly",3,2
it has been written that this unit is comparable to the Bose wave radio<br />but I found that to be untrue after trying it and have returned it<br />I have since purchased the wave radio,3,2

is pretty good. I would of thought the leather would of been higher quality but considering it was directly from a factory in china I guess I should of seem it coming or checked to see if it was from the us or a us company,3,7707
"The cover is what I ordered.  I like it, but I wish it had more cover on the front of my iPod.  It covers the back perfectly, but the front isn't very protected.",3,7708
"The only problem i'm getting is that it won't read the 32 GB card.  16 GB works good though, I might get another one for my wife's car.",3,7709
"This is better than the one I bought earlier which I had to dispose it after one run. So far, I am ok but I am still doubtful of the quality.",3,7710
"Work good, a little short though.",3,7711
I really liked the extra length because it gives you more mobility but you getter get use to that 12 ft radius cause it doesn't charge near as fast as the original cord,3,7712
"It works.  But there are a few things I don't like about it.<br /><br />You can put the micro SD card in the slot incorrectly...that will require you to take the thing apart to get the card out.<br /><br />Also, it will only record for an hour before it starts overwritting the older video files....no matter how much space you have on your SD card.  My suggestion is to carry a couple of SD cards in your car with you, in case you want to keep something you recorded and continue recording your trip.",3,7713
its ok,3,7714
"I ordered this thing a couple weeks ago(the shipping was okay, but it wasn't the best). When I got it, the first thing i noticed was that the case was incredibly slim(compared to my old case.) The second thing i noticed was they shipped me a \\""universal\\"" screen guard, which means it doesn't fit. The thing is bigger than the ipod itself! I may be the only one this happened to, but keep in mind the ignorance of sellers sometimes.",3,7715
Radio works good and sounds good for the price its worth the money i had purchased a stereo from Boss which looked like a better radio but it sucked all you heard was static this radio isnt top of the line but it works well,3,7716
"[[ASIN:B001AH5KQQ 8 GB MP4/MP3 Player with FM Radio, Camera, Voice Recorder, USB Portable, and 2.8-inch Touchscreen]]    The technology behind this device is wonderful. I having trouble with the features which comes with it such as the touch capability. I find it hard to select an option, this mal-function had me going loco. because when i want to play the next song i have to touch the play button instead of forward button. Otherwise the audio is nice, camera is fair, and other such feature is wonderful.",3,7717
left  a little open at the top but it works,3,7718
I was looking for a device that allowed my phone with bluetooth to play pandora through the car FM radio.<br />The only way to do this with this device is to plug my phone into the device with the cable that is included.<br />FM transmitter works great.<br />Music sounds great through FM transmitter.,3,7719
"I bought this to go in my Saturn Sky and I must say, there are lots of things I love about it.  Let us start there.<br /><br />The awesome display.  Great colors, resolution, contrast, and brightness breathe life back into touch-screen car stereos.  With all of the personal electronics with high-res touch screens, it's easy to be disappointed when you get in your car and deal with the limited, clunky POS screen of your stereo.  This isn't as good as a cell phone or tablet, but no other comes closer.<br /><br />The intuitive interface is initially cumbersome but becomes second nature after a few days of tinkering with it.  I really like the addition of a front reset button which has saved my butt already.  I was tinkering with settings and accidentally activated the rear camera with no way of turning it off; even removing power didn't work.  I have not experienced any glitches as of yet, but I'm sure that after I submit this review the screen will start freezing like a biznach every time I get in the dang car.<br /><br />The sound quality is just great.  Many pioneer decks use the same DAC and EQ with the same result.  For a touch screen with all the other stuff pioneer gives you it aint bad and they only make one better automotive-grade DSP (on their stupid-expensive single din I've never known anybody to buy)<br /><br />It looks great both on and off, but I would really like it if pioneer would release some more screen visualizations because I just freaking LOVE those things, not that the stock ones aren't awesome or anything.  I just want more or the ability to use low-res looping AVI's or something.  That'd be awesome.  I also love being able to set daytime and nighttime screen brightness settings easily.  Thanks Pioneer.<br /><br />As many have said bluetooth works great, almost seamlessly.  That digital radio is freaking awesome too.  I have a stubby antenna because the stock one on my car was rediculous.  It helps a bunch.  I do find the people on bluetooth calls can't hear me well.  Not sure why this is.  Maybe I have a faulty mic from Pioneer.  I haven't had a chance to test the AppRadio or any of the advanced stuff.  More on that later, ugh.<br /><br />Finally, it just has everything you could want besides Navi, which, as people have said typically sucks when housed on-board.  I have to agree.  I hate buying maps almost as much as I hate updating them.  My phone works much better anyway.  The AVH-P8400BH has tons of outputs, inputs, and everything else.  The best part is the detatchable faceplate.  This is awesome.  I travel a lot and I have had these stolen so many times in the past.  This was probably the deal breaker for me.  Nobody else does this more successfully, but you pay for it.  This thing is expensive.<br /><br />Now the bad.  I hate to admit it, but there's only one thing I hate and it's becoming so problematic that it's ruining so many amazing opportunities to build great products.  What is it?  Pioneer dove head-first into Apple's open arms (like a few others did and are now regretting) and it couldn't have possibly went worse.  The really expensive cable, shoddy integration, and problematic glitches prove that once again, attempts to coexist peacefully with Apple have been unsuccessful.  Android phones really got dumped on and for no reason, and it's shameful hitting the applications button and seeing almost everything grayed out, almost like you're not taking advantage of 3/4 of your radios' capabilities.  This obsession with Apple would've caused me to purchase another company's product if this thing wasn't still better than any of the competition.  I know because I looked... alot.  I feel like the android capabilities of this unit would've been much better if they had spent any time whatsoever developing for it.  That being said, buy this for the looks, resolution, interface, sound quality, bluetooth, detatchable faceplate, and hardware features.  Do NOT buy it because you have an iPhone.  Heck, ifyou have an iPhone you probably couldn't figure out how to use this thing in the first place.  Maybe pioneer will do more with this in the future as it's currently their flagship receiver.  If you're reading this Pioneer, please put some work into this.  Seriously with all of the smart devices out there and the versatility of linux/android I've known a singular individual that wrote better software in a public library on a 400-dollar laptop.  You have a high-paid development team that probably knows they can do better and there's no excuse considering you now have 500 dollars of my harder-earned cash.",3,7720
This is a fun novelty toy.  I did put it against my Wi-Fi and it shows a clear digital pulsing outward.  This means it is definitely measuring outputs of signals.  Most of the time interference from something legitimate or other will taint your results and lead you all over.,3,7721
